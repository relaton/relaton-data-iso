abstract:
- content: "1.1 This practice covers the preparation, handling, testing, and procedure
    for using the ethanol-chlorobenzene (ECB) dosimetry system to measure absorbed
    dose to water when exposed to ionizing radiation. The system consists of a dosimeter
    and appropriate analytical instrumentation. For simplicity, the system will be
    referred to as the ECB system. The ECB dosimeter is classiﬁed as a type I dosimeter
    on the basis of the effect of inﬂuence quantities. The ECB dosimetry system may
    be used as a reference standard dosimetry system or as a routine dosimetry system.\n1.2
    ISO/ASTM 51538 is one of a set of standards that provides recommendations for
    properly implementing dosimetry in radiation processing, and describes a means
    of achieving compliance with the requirements of ISO/ASTM Practice 52628 for the
    ECB system. It is intended to be read in conjunction with ISO/ASTM Practice 52628.\n1.3
    This practice describes the mercurimetric titration analysis as a standard readout
    procedure for the ECB dosimeter when used as a reference standard dosimetry system.
    Other readout methods (spectrophotometric, oscillometric) that are applicable
    when the ECB system is used as a routine dosimetry system are described in Annex
    A1 and Annex A2.\n1.4 This practice applies only to gamma radiation,\nX-radiation/bremsstrahlung,
    and high energy electrons. \n1.5 This practice applies provided the following
    conditions are satisﬁed:\n1.5.1 The absorbed dose range is between 10 Gy and 2
    MGy for gamma radiation and between 10 Gy and 200 kGy for high current electron
    accelerators (1, 2) (Warning?the boiling point of ethanol chlorobenzene solutions
    is approximately 80 °C. Ampoules may explode if the temperature during irradiation
    exceeds the boiling point. This boiling point may be exceeded if an absorbed dose
    greater than 200 kGy is given in a short period of time.)\n1.5.2 The absorbed-dose
    rate is less than 106 Gy s−1(2).\n1.5.3 For radionuclide gamma-ray sources, the
    initial pho-ton energy is greater than 0.6 MeV. For bremsstrahlung photons, the
    energy of the electrons used to produce the bremsstrahlung photons is equal to
    or greater than 2 MeV. For electron beams, the initial electron energy is greater
    than 8 MeV (3).\nNOTE 1 The same response relative to 60Co gamma radiation was
    obtained in high-power bremsstrahlung irradiation produced bya5MeV electron accelerator
    (4).\nNOTE 2 The lower energy limits are appropriate for a cylindrical dosimeter
    ampoule of 12-mm diameter. Corrections for dose gradients across the ampoule may
    be required for electron beams. The ECB system may be used at lower energies by
    employing thinner (in the beam direction) dosimeters (see ICRU Report 35). The
    ECB system may also be used at X-ray energies as low as 120 kVp (5). However,
    in this range of photon energies the effect caused by the ampoule wall is considerable.\nNOTE
    3 The effects of size and shape of the dosimeter on the response of the dosimeter
    can adequately be taken into account by performing the appropriate calculations
    using cavity theory (6).\n1.5.4 The irradiation temperature of the dosimeter is
    within the range from −30 °C to 80 °C.\nNOTE 4 The temperature dependence of dosimeter
    response is known only in this range (see 5.2). For use outside this range, the
    dosimetry system should be calibrated for the required range of irradiation tempera-tures.\n1.6
    This standard does not purport to address all of the safety concerns, if any,
    associated with its use. It is the responsibility of the user of this standard
    to establish appro-priate safety and health practices and determine the applica-bility
    of regulatory limitations prior to use. Speciﬁc warnings are given in 1.5.1, 9.2
    and 10.2.\n1.7 This international standard was developed in accor-dance with internationally
    recognized principles on standard-ization established in the Decision on Principles
    for the Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom-mendations issued
    by the World Trade Organization Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee."
