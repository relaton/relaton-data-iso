    This document specifies the hydraulic pulse durability test for composite filter housings. This method tests the ability of full-flow lubricating oil filters manufactured with composite pressure vessel materials for internal combustion engines to withstand an internal pressure surge and cyclic internal pressure variations experienced in the application at specified operating temperatures.
    These tests are intended for application to spin-on type filters and detachable filters with disposable elements constructed of composite or temperature-sensitive materials.
