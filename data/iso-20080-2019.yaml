    This document specifies general requirements and constraints applicable to a remote diagnostic process, the use cases and scenarios to support the implementation of a remote diagnostic process using a standardized interface of the ExVe.
    It concerns:
    —          the road vehicles with four or more wheels designed and constructed primarily for the carriage of persons that are defined as Category 1 vehicles in the United Nations Special Resolution No.1 in TRANS/WP.29/1045, as last amended on 19 June 2012, and
    —          the road vehicle with four or more wheels designed and constructed primarily for the carriage of goods that are defined as Category 2 vehicles in the United Nations Special Resolution No.1 in TRANS/WP.29/1045, as last amended on 19 June 2012,
    where these road vehicles are still in accordance with the specifications of the vehicle manufacturer.
    This document does not define the interfaces provided by the ExVe nor the internal implementation inside the ExVe.
    Processes like repair, prognostics, monitoring, configuration, re-programming and variant coding are not part of this document.
    The prerequisites (e.g. authentication and authorization) for all use cases are not covered within this document. A possible specification of the required content for the implementation of a remote diagnostic application using the web interface of the ExVe according to ISO 20078 is given in Annex A.
