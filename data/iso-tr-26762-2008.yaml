abstract:
- content: ISO/TR 26762:2008 describes the production measurements, in terms of both
    hardware and procedures, that can be used to allocate the gas and condensate back
    to the individual concessions, reservoirs and wells in a fair and equitable way.
    The objective is to give an approach that is recognized to be current best practice
    and that has a wide support in the oil and gas industry.
