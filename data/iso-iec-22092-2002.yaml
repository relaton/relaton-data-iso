abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 22092:2002 specifies the mechanical, physical, and optical characteristics
    of a 130 mm optical disk cartridge (ODC) that employs thermo-magnetic and magneto-optical
    effects to enable data interchange between such disks.\nISO/IEC 22092:2002 specifies
    two Types, viz.\nType R/W provides for data to be written, read and erased many
    time over the recording surface(s) of the disk.\nType WO provides for data once
    written to be read a multiplicity of times. Data shall not be erased nor amended.
    Multisession (incremental write operations) recording may be performed on type
    WO disks.\nThe disk shall be of the same Type if recorded on both sides, A and
    B. Each side shall have a nominal capacity of 4,58 Gbytes, irrespective of the
    Type. The format specifies two sector sizes and allows for emulation of two further
    sizes. \nISO/IEC 22092:2002 specifies\n- the conditions for conformance testing
    and the Reference Drive;\n- the environments in which the cartridges are to be
    operated and stored;\n- the mechanical, physical and dimensional characteristics
    of the cartridge so as to provide mechanical interchangeability between data processing
    systems;\n- the format of the information on the disk, both embossed and user-written,
    including the physical disposition of the tracks and sectors, the error correction
    codes, the modulation methods used;\n- the characteristics of the embossed information
    on the disk;\n- the thermo-magnetic and magneto-optical characteristics of the
    disk, enabling processing systems to write data onto the disk;\n- the minimum
    quality of user-written data on the disk, enabling data processing systems to
    read data from the disk.\nISO/IEC 22092:2002 provides for interchange between
    optical disk drives. Together with a standard for volume and file structure it
    provides for full data interchange between data processing systems."
