    This document specifies requirements for couplers for the mechanical splicing of steel reinforcing bars. More onerous requirements can be specified by the customer.
    This document is applicable to the continuous production of coupler components. It is intended to be used with adequate control measures for the processing of reinforcing bars, i.e. the production of the mechanical splice.
    This document specifies requirements for couplers used for mechanical splices in reinforced concrete structures under predominantly static loads. It specifies additional requirements for couplers used in structures subject to high-cycle elastic fatigue loading and/or low-cycle elastic-plastic reverse loading.
    NOTE       ISO 15835-3 specifies the quantity of tests.
    Compression-only couplers such as end-bearing sleeves are not covered by the ISO 15835 series.
