abstract:
- content: |-
    This standard would provide general requirements and guidance for the development and application of LAMP-based methods for the detection of microorganisms and associated genetic markers sampled along the food chain (e.g., ingredients, human food, animal food, and the production environment), and includes sample preparation, isothermal amplification, signal detection, data interpretation, and performance criteria. This standard would also define laboratory and data management practices to ensure that LAMP methods are performed accurately, and data are reported clearly for end users and stakeholders.

    Out of scope - LAMP methods applied for non-food (medical/veterinary) use.
