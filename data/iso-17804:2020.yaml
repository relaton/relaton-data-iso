    This document defines the grades and the corresponding requirements for ausferritic spheroidal graphite cast irons.
    This document specifies five grades of ausferritic spheroidal graphite cast iron by a classification based on mechanical properties determined on machined test pieces prepared from:
    —     separately cast samples, side-by-side cast or cast-on samples;
    —     samples cut from a casting.
    This document also specifies two grades by a classification as a function of hardness.
