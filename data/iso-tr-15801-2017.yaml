abstract:
- content: |-
    ISO/TR 15801:2017 describes the implementation and operation of information management systems that store and make available for use electronically stored information (ESI) in a trustworthy and reliable manner. Such ESI can be of any type, including "page based" information, information in databases and audio/video information.
    ISO/TR 15801:2017 is for use by any organization that uses systems to store trustworthy ESI over time. Such systems incorporate policies, procedures, technology and audit requirements that ensure that trustworthiness of the ESI is maintained.
    ISO/TR 15801:2017 does not cover processes used to evaluate whether ESI can be considered to be trustworthy prior to it being stored or imported into the system. However, it can be used to demonstrate that, once the electronic information is stored, output from the system will be a true and accurate reproduction of the ESI created and/or imported.
