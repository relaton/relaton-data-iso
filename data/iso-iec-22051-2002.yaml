  content: "ISO/IEC 22051:2002 specifies the physical and magnetic characteristics
    of magnetic tape cartridges, using magnetic tape 12,65 mm wide so as to provide
    physical interchange of such cartridges between drives. It also specifies the
    quality of the recorded signals, the recording method and the recorded format,
    thereby allowing data interchange between drives by means of such cartridges.\nThe
    linearly recorded format, called Super Digital Linear Tape 1 (SDLT 1), has 448
    tracks. It uses a combination of magnetic and optical technologies known as Laser-Guided
    Magnetic Recording (LGMR). The back surface of the tape presents optically detected
    servo marks. \nThe format is derived from the DLT Format. It provides for a capacity
    of 110 Gbytes of uncompressed user data, or typically 220 Gbytes of compressed
    user data.\nTogether with a standard for volume and file structure this document
    provides for full data interchange between data processing systems."
