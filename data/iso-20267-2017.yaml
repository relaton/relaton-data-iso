    ISO 20267:2017 specifies a method for measuring the interfacial toughness of thermal spray ceramic coatings at room temperature based on an indentation method. The interfacial toughness is calculated from the mean length of cracks emanating from the corners of the impression induced by a Vickers hardness tester, and it is intended for use with ceramic coatings with a single layer or multilayers. The test procedures proposed in this document are intended for use in an ambient environment.
    ISO 20267:2017 is recommended for thermal spray ceramic coatings such as thermal barrier coatings, wear resistant coatings and electrical insulating coatings.
