    This document specifies general requirements for conductive power transfer with a voltage up to 1 000 V a.c. (alternative current) and up to 1 500 V d.c. (direct current) between electrically propelled road vehicles and external electric circuits.
    This document provides general requirements for conductive charging in modes 2, 3 and 4 according to IEC 61851-1, and for reverse power transfer. This document does not provide requirements for mode 1. For mode 4, this document provides requirements regarding the power transfer only with isolated DC EV supply equipment according to IEC 61851-23.
    NOTE            External electric circuits are not part of the vehicle.
    This document applies to the vehicle power supply circuits.
    This document does not provide;
    —     requirements for simultaneous operation of multiple  EV plugs or vehicle inlets, and
    —     requirements for power transfer while driving (electric road systems),
    but they are under consideration.
    This document does not provide:
    —     requirements for mopeds and motorcycles (which are specified in ISO 18246), and
    —     comprehensive safety information for manufacturing, maintenance and repair personnel.
