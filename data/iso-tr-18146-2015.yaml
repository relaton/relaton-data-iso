    ISO/TR 18146:2015 contains non-normative information on spacecraft design and operational practices for mitigating space debris.
    ISO/TR 18146:2015 is a supporting document to the family of international standards addressing space debris mitigation (see 2.2). The purpose of these standards is to minimize the creation of additional space debris by ensuring that spacecraft and launch vehicle orbital stages are designed, operated and disposed of in a manner that prevents them from generating debris throughout their orbital lifetime.
    ISO/TR 18146:2015 can be used to guide spacecraft engineers in the application of these space debris mitigation standards. Table 1 lists the main debris mitigation requirements defined in the standards and compares them to equivalent recommendations published by the United Nations and the Inter-Agency Space Debris Coordination Committee.
