    This part of ISO 12234 specifies a basic removable-memory reference model for digital electronic still-picture cameras. The reference model includes image file formats for storing image data and metadata, file system requirements for storing and retrieving the image files on the removable memory, and media profiles which are specific to a given storage technology. The reference model allows the image data and metadata to be interchanged among the various components of an electronic imaging system by using the removable storage media.
