abstract:
- content: |-
    ISO 16311-1:2014 presents the framework and general principles for maintenance and repair of all kinds of existing concrete structures ? un-reinforced and reinforced concrete, prestressed concrete and steel-concrete composite structures, or their structural members.
    ISO 16311-1:2014 , deterioration is clearly distinguished from damage occurring in a short period and not developing over subsequent time, such as cracking and scaling due to earthquakes or impact loading, etc. Deterioration is mainly dealt with as a target for the maintenance activities.
    ISO 16311-1:2014 also provides the basic concept of repair and preventions carried out to restore structural performance of existing structures.
    ISO 16311-1:2014 does not cover those aspects of maintenance and repair that are related to serviceability and esthetics without direct impact on durability and service life, e.g. cleaning of drains, removal of vegetation, refreshment of paint, etc. Neither does it cover repair of defects during execution of new structures.
