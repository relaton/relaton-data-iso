    ISO 21012:2006 gives design, construction, type and production testing, and marking requirements for non-insulated cryogenic flexible hoses used for the transfer of cryogenic fluids within the following range of operating conditions:
    - working temperature: from minus 270 °C to minus 65 °C;
    - nominal size (DN): from 10 to 100.
    End fittings for mounting of any couplings are within the scope of this International Standard, but the couplings are subject to other standards.
