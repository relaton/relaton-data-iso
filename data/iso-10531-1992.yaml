abstract:
- content: The tests are intended to assess the performance of completely formed unit
    loads as they are subjected to the hazards of (land) environmental exposure, storage,
    handling and transportation. They are concerned with pallet handling, clamp handling,
    push/pull handling, examination of failure and may be performed as part of a sequence.
    Marine environment is not dealt with. Annex A describes lift truck handling tests.
