    This document provides guidance to community authorities on how to use smart technologies and smart ways of working to improve their ability to anticipate, manage and mitigate public-health emergencies (PHEs), including through transparent, interactive and citizen-centric communications with citizens. It does this by demonstrating how the principles and good practices for smart city operating models recommended in ISO 37106 can deliver improved outcomes in public-health emergency management (PHEM), at every stage of the command-and-control process for emergency management and incident response set out in ISO 22320.
    This document sets out recommendations for community authorities and provides tools that can be used to assess the maturity of community systems for smart PHEM.
    This document applies to all types of cities and communities that are willing to apply smart city operating models to respond to PHEs.
