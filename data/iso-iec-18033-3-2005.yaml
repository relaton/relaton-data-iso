  content: "ISO/IEC 18033 specifies encryption systems (ciphers) for the purpose of
    data confidentiality. \nISO/IEC 18033-3:2005 specifies block ciphers. A block
    cipher is a symmetric encipherment system with the property that the encryption
    algorithm operates on a block of plaintext, i.e. a string of bits of a defined
    length, to yield a block of ciphertext.\nISO/IEC 18033-3:2005 specifies the following
    algorithms.\n- 64-bit block ciphers: TDEA, MISTY1, CAST-128.\n- 128-bit block
    ciphers: AES, Camellia, SEED.\nNOTE The primary purpose of encryption (or encipherment)
    techniques is to protect the confidentiality of stored or transmitted data. An
    encryption algorithm is applied to data (often called plaintext or cleartext)
    to yield encrypted data (or ciphertext); this process is known as encryption.
    The encryption algorithm is designed so that the ciphertext yields no information
    about the plaintext except, perhaps, its length. Associated with every encryption
    algorithm is a corresponding decryption algorithm, which transforms ciphertext
    back into its original plaintext."
