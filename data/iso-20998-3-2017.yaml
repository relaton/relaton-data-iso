  content: "ISO 20998-3:2017 gives guidelines for ultrasonic attenuation spectroscopy
    methods for determining the size distributions of one or more material phases
    dispersed in a liquid at high concentrations, where the ultrasonic attenuation
    spectrum is not a linear function of the particle volume fraction. In this regime,
    particle-particle interactions are not negligible. \nISO 20998-3:2017 is applicable
    to colloids, dispersions, slurries, and emulsions. The typical particle size for
    such analysis ranges from 10 nm to 3 mm, although particles outside this range
    have also been successfully measured. Measurements can be made for concentrations
    of the dispersed phase ranging from about 5 % by volume to over 50 % by volume,
    depending on the density contrast between the continuous and the dispersed phases,
    the particle size, and the frequency range[9] [10]. These ultrasonic methods can
    be used to monitor dynamic changes in the size distribution, including agglomeration
    or flocculation."
