abstract:
- content: |-
    This document outlines the design principles and the service and standards requirements to enable an interoperable system for genomic surveillance (herein referred to as “federated surveillance system”), including data representation, discovery and analysis, and data linkage.
    Using select profiles this document applies to genomics digital systems, networks and platforms that enable a federated approach for researchers, clinicians, and patients in both the private and public sector at the local, regional, and international levels.
