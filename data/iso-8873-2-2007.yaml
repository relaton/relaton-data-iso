  content: "ISO 8873-2:2007 outlines requirements for the application of rigid cellular
    plastic spray polyurethane foam for thermal insulation. The primary application
    of the material is for use as thermal insulation. Spray polyurethane foam can
    also be used as the air barrier material which forms part of an air barrier assembly
    in buildings. Under specific application conditions, the material can be used
    in vapour barrier applications in a building assembly (details of the conditions
    can be obtained from the manufacturer). The application requirements are for the
    installation of spray polyurethane foam whether applied on a building site or
    in a prefabrication (manufacturing) facility. \nISO 8873-2:2007 can be used for
    non-building applications when agreed to by the supplier and the purchaser.\nThe
    requirements include obligations for the manufacturer, the contractor and the
    installer. The requirements include the selection of chemical components, application
    requirements, quality control and documentation of the application, limitations
    for the application and requirements for safety and for disposal of associated
    waste material and packaging."
