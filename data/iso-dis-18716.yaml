abstract:
- content: This document provides guidelines describing the characteristics of a professional
    farmer organization. It is primarily targeted towards commercially-oriented farmer
    organizations rather than purely socially-oriented farmer organizations or individual
    farmers. It is intended to be relevant for large and small farmer organizations,
    without regard to the number of members, volume of business, output or capital
    investment, nor to the specific crop or product. The implementation and interpretation
    of this document can be adapted for very small or nascent organizations, for specific
    or differentiated products, or for markets with special requirements.
