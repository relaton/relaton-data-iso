    clause on quantification and verification and updated definitions as beneficial.
    \n\nTo facilitate ISO/TC265’s desire to have this guidance publish as soon as
    possible, this revision will comprise the addition of a quantification and verification
    of geological storage of CO2 clause as well as the correction of errors or inconsistencies
    only.  Changes to other clauses in the Standard are not proposed as part of this
    revision, other than those necessary to incorporate quantification and verification."
