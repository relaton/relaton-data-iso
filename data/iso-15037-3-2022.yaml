    This document specifies the general conditions that apply to vehicle ride comfort test methods.
    In particular, it specifies general conditions for:
    —    variables;
    —    measuring equipment and data processing;
    —    environment (test track and wind velocity);
    —    test vehicle preparation (tuning and loading);
    —    initial driving;
    —    test reports (general data and test conditions).
    These items are of general significance, regardless of the specific vehicle ride comfort test method. They apply when vehicle ride comfort properties are determined, unless other conditions are required by the standard which is actually used for the test method.
    This document is applicable to passenger cars as defined in ISO 3833 and light trucks.
    NOTE      The general conditions defined in existing vehicle dynamics standards are valid until a reference to this document is included.
    This document mainly refers to road tests, but in many cases can be applied also for bench tests.
