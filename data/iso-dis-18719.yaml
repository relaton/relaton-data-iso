    This document specifies the methods for the chemical analysis of impurities in refined high purity yttrium oxide (Y2O3) powders used as a raw material for fine ceramics.
    It stipulates the methods for the determination of aluminium (Al), calcium (Ca), cobalt (Co), iron (Fe) and silicon (Si) in yttrium oxide powders. Yttrium oxide powders are decomposed by microwave decomposition method. The aluminium (Al), calcium (Ca), cobalt (Co), iron (Fe) and silicon (Si) contents are determined by using an inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES).
    This document does not apply to coarse unrefined powders from mineral extraction and processing operations, which are covered by ISO 24181-1.
