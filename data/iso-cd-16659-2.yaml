abstract:
- content: "The standard ISO 16659-1 is the general part of a set of standards on
    the different in-situ test methods for iodine traps, describing common general
    provisions applicable to all methods. \nThe current standard ISO 16659-2 presents
    the in-situ testing method for measuring the efficiency of iodine traps using
    a radioactive methyl iodine method (CH3I). This standard present the specific
    provisions according to the expected role of this iodine trap, requirements about
    workers protections, requirement about environment protection to take into account
    during these tests."
