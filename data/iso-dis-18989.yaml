  script: Latn
  content: The proposed standard defines the general principles for determining stress-strain
    curves for plastics in a wide strain rate field, with a focus on data entry of
    material cards for finite element simulations in the event of transient loads
    (impact/crash). The procedure is to be used to investigate the strain rate dependent
    uniaxial tensile deformation behaviour of test specimens and to determine the
    tensile stress-strain relationship under noncyclic, highly dynamic conditions.
    The procedure is particularly suitable for use in the material group of injection-moulded
    thermoplastics, unfilled and filled, including short fiber reinforced thermoplastics
    with a fiber length of up to 7.5mm as well as curable plastics. The proposed standard
    only describes tests in a standard climate.
