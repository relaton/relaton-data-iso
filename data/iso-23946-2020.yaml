  content: This document specifies a method for use of a gonio-spectrofluorometer
    to measure internal quantum efficiency, external quantum efficiency, absorptance,
    luminescent radiance factor and relative fluorescence spectrum of ceramic phosphor
    powders which are used in white light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and emit visible
    light when excited by UV or blue light.
