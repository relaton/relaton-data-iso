    This document specifies requirements for non-alloy and alloy steels that are intended for cold heading or cold extruding and are delivered as wire rods, wire or bars. It also contains specific requirements for:
    —    steels not intended for heat treatment, with diameters from 2 mm to 100 mm (see Annex A);
    —    case-hardening steels with diameters from 2 mm to 100 mm (see Annex B);
    —    steels for quenching and tempering, including boron alloyed steels (see Table C.3), with diameters from 2 mm to 100 mm (see Annex C);
    —    stainless steels with diameters of 0,8 mm up to 50 mm for austenitic steels, up to 25 mm for ferritic steels and up to 100 mm for martensitic steels (see Annex D).
    This document (except Annex A) is applicable to the properties of cold-headed or cold-extruded parts which have been subjected to a subsequent heat treatment. As the properties of the parts in the cold-headed or cold-extruded, and subsequently not-heat-treated condition, are largely dependent on the applied cold-heading or cold-extruding conditions, these are, if necessary, subject to agreement between the purchaser and the manufacturer of the parts.
