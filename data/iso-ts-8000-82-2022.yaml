    This document describes how data rules apply to various types of data. Such rules exist to sustain the integrity and reliability of data by capturing requirements into a form that can be processed by databases and other information systems.
    The following are within the scope of this document:
    —    fundamental concepts of data rules;
    —    key characteristics of data rules for common types of data, where these types are identifier, currency value, quantity, date or time, rate, free‑text entry, code and key;
    —    how data profiling contributes to formulating effective data rules.
    The following is outside the scope of this document:
    —    specific rules for specific sets of data.
    This document can be used in conjunction with or independently of standards for quality management systems.
    EXAMPLE 1   ISO 9001 specifies requirements for quality management systems.
    This document can also be used in conjunction with or independently of standards for more detailed definitions of data types.
    EXAMPLE 2   ISO/IEC 11404 specifies the nomenclature and shared semantics for a collection of datatypes commonly occurring in programming languages and software interfaces.
    EXAMPLE 3   IEC 61360‑1 specifies principles for the definition of the properties and associated attributes and explains the methods for representing verbally defined concepts.
