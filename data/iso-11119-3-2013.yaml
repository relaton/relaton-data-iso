    ISO 11119-3:2013 specifies requirements for composite gas cylinders up to 150 l water capacity and composite tubes above 150 l water capacity and up to 450 l water capacity, for the storage and conveyance of compressed or liquefied gases.
    The cylinders and tubes in ISO 11119-3:2013 are
    - Type 4 Fully Wrapped Cylinders or Tubes with a non-load sharing liner and composite reinforcement on both the cylindrical portion and the dome ends, and
    - Type 5 Fully Wrapped Cylinders or Tubes without liners (including cylinders without liners manufactured from two parts joined together) and with a test pressure of less than 60 bar.
    The cylinders are constructed
    - in the form of a disposable mandrel overwrapped with carbon fibre or aramid fibre or glass fibre (or a mixture thereof) in a resin matrix to provide longitudinal and circumferential reinforcement, and
    - in the form of two filament wound shells joined together.
    Cylinders and tubes manufactured and tested to ISO 11119-3:2013 are not intended to contain toxic, oxidizing or corrosive gases.
    ISO 11119-3:2013 is limited to cylinders and tubes with composite reinforcement of carbon fibre or aramid fibre or glass fibre (or a mixture thereof) in a matrix.
    Cylinders and tubes manufactured and tested to ISO 11119-3:2013 have a minimum design life of 15 years.
    ISO 11119-3:2013 does not address the design, fitting and performance of removable protective sleeves.
