- content: |-
    This document establishes requirements and recommendations for adventure tourism involving cyclotourism [e.g. road bike, mountain bike, gravel bike, bikepacking or fatbike, including electrically power assisted cycles (EPAC) and mountain EPAC], relating to the safety of participants, leaders and assistants.
    This document also establishes criteria relating to characteristics and difficulty levels for cyclotourism route classification.
    This document applies to cyclotourism offered as a tourism product. Tourism product design involves a product planning and development phase that is not covered in this document. Some tourism products include cyclotourism combined with other tourism services (e.g. transfers, meals, lodging), but this document applies only to cyclotourism. Additional tourism services are excluded from the scope.
    This document is applicable to any kind of adventure tourism activity provider that offers tourism products consisting of cyclotourism.
    This document is not applicable to sportive cycling activities (including mountain biking in bike parks or in ski areas), bicycle rentals or bicycle sharing use (i.e. bicycle rental for urban or rural mobility) with no adventure tourism purposes.
    This document does not cover the maintenance and repair work of the bicycle.
