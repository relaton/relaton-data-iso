abstract:
- content: This document specifies the test methods of temperature-controlled packages
    for parcel shipping. Tests include physical, thermal conductivity and insulation
    performances of transport packages that use insulation for the purpose of blocking
    thermal conduction between the inside and the outside of a product package that
    need temperature control.
