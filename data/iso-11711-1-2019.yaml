    This document specifies requirements for the design and the fitting arrangements of ballast water discharge sample ports.
    In coordination with the vessel, a suitable sample collection probe is installed into the shipboard sample port as needed to collect ballast samples, and the port is sealed with a blind flange at other times. This document addresses the location of sample ports to accommodate representative sampling, and it standardizes the presentation of the port to accommodate various probe configurations. It provides specifications for a return port to the ballast line downstream of the sample collection port, allowing processed sample water to be returned to the ballast pipe. The appropriate sample probe and other sample collection apparatus is determined by the sample collection team according to the requirements of ISO 11711‑2.
    NOTE       The distinction between the sample port discussed in this document and the sample probe discussed in ISO 11711-2 is worth noting. The sample port is a permanent apparatus designed and installed in the ship's ballast piping to accept multiple sample probe configurations. The sample probe is a temporarily installed water collection pipe designed by the sampling party to mate with the sample port and to meet the measurement objectives of the sample.
    This document is applicable to ships with a ballast discharge pipe size of DN 100 or greater, with turbulent flows. Guidance for smaller ballast pipe diameters is given in Annex A.
    This document primarily addresses the collection of ballast water discharge samples. Optional requirements for installation of sample ports intended to collect uptake samples are provided in Annex B.
