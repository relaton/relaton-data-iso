    ISO 11121:2009 specifies minimum requirements for training organizations that offer introductory scuba experience training programmes to non-divers.
    ISO 11121:2009 applies to programmes that include participants being taken into an open water environment. It does not apply to programmes that are exclusively conducted in a confined water environment (e.g. swimming pools).
    ISO 11121:2009 also specifies the conditions under which this service is to be provided, which supplement the general requirements for recreational diving services specified in ISO 24803.
