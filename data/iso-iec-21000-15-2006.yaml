  script: Latn
  content: "ISO/IEC 21000-15:2006 specifies a mechanism to monitor events associated
    with the manipulation and usage of Digital Items, as defined in ISO/IEC 21000-2,
    and Peers. Monitoring the usage of audio-visual digital material and gaining insight
    into the state or capacity of a Peer is an important functionality for many content
    creation, delivery, adaptation and consumption applications.\nISO/IEC 21000-15:2006
    specifies a dynamic mechanism which allows Users to create an Event Report Request
    within a Digital Item which can then be processed by a Peer. Such an Event Report
    Request specifies the conditions when an Event Report will be first generated
    and then sent to a (set of) recipient Peer(s). \nISO/IEC 21000-15:2006 specifies
    the syntax and semantics of Event Report Requests (ER-R) and of Event Reports.\nEvent
    Report Requests unambiguously specify the nature and conditions under which Event
    Reports must be sent to the specified recipients, as well as the recipients of
    the resulting Event Reports. The main parts of an ER-R are\n- Event Report Request
    Descriptors that provides descriptive information about the Event Report Request
    itself;\n- an Event Condition Descriptor that specifies a set of conditions that
    relate to either a Peer (e.g. it's internal time, status, technical capacity)
    or a Digital Item (if they have been acted upon by, for example, the use of Digital
    Item Processing) and that trigger the creation of Event Reports;\n- an Event Report
    Specification that defines how the resulting Event Report should be structured
    and what information it should contain.\nUpon the occurrence of the Event (as
    defined by the Event Report Request), a Peer will generate an Event Report, based
    on details contained within the Event Report Specification. The Event Report can
    then be sent to the recipient(s) as specified in the ER-R.\nISO/IEC 21000-15:2006
    further specifies mechanisms to automate the exchange of Event Reports. Event
    Reports may for instance, embed Event Report Requests that are to be processed
    upon reception of the Event Report by a Peer. This mechanism allows for Event
    Reports to be automatically forwarded to another Peer, or for sending back an
    Acknowledgment of Receipt to the Event Report's originating Peer."
