    This document provides design requirements and guidance for the manufacturers of electrical and electronic equipment for use in all kinds of mobile (including hand-held) agricultural machinery, forestry machinery, landscaping and gardening machinery [referred to hereafter as machine(s)]. The term machinery covers tractors and implements. This document gives tests for specific environmental conditions and defines severity levels for tests which relate to the environmental extremes that can be experienced in practical operation of the equipment.
    This document is intended to be used in determining the suitability of the equipment of these machines, for use in a specified range of environmental conditions.
    NOTE    The severity levels given are general guidelines and not guaranteed worst-case exposure levels.
