abstract:
- content: This standard provides human machine interface (HMI) design specifications
    by Over The Air (OTA) software updates for passenger cars (including sport utility
    vehicles and light trucks) plus commercial vehicles (including heavy trucks and
    buses). These HMI specifications include state transitions, timing, HMI locations
    with respect to the driver, types of information, necessary notifications and
    warnings, confirmation of successful completion, and how deviations from the intended
    results will be handled, based on sequences defined in ISO24089. It covers software
    updates facilitated both while driving and while stationary
