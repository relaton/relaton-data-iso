    ISO/IEC 11581 applies to software products providing office applications such as document production, desktop
    publishing, finance, and planning that present their functions via a graphical user interface.
    ISO/IEC 11581 applies to software products for people who are familiar with office work but who are at present not
    necessarily familiar with computer-based applications.
    ISO/IEC 11581 is meant to be used by persons involved in the design, implementation, and evaluation of icons for
    graphical user interfaces to computer-based office applications, and by procurers of systems that employ such
    interfaces.
    Other parts of ISO/IEC 11581 contain:
    _ graphics of commonly used icons, and
    _ descriptions of the functionality of the icons.
    This part of ISO/IEC 11581-1 provides a framework for the development and design of icons and their application
    on screens capable of displaying graphics as well as text. It contains:
    _ general requirements and recommendations for icons;
    _ global variations to the graphical representations of icons.
