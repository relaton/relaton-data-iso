    ISO 22965-1:2007 applies to concrete for structures cast in situ, pre-cast structures and structural pre-cast products for buildings and civil engineering structures. The concrete can be mixed on site, ready-mixed concrete or produced in a plant for pre-cast concrete products.
    ISO 22965-1:2007 applies to concrete compacted to retain no appreciable amount of entrapped air other than entrained air and to normal-weight, heavy-weight and light-weight concrete.
    Other International Standards for specific products, e.g. pre-cast products, or for processes within the field of the scope of ISO 22965-1:2007, can require or permit deviations from ISO 22965-1:2007.
    ISO 22965-1:2007 contains requirements for the specification of concrete and guidance for the exchange of information between the specifier and supplier. An informative annex gives general guidance on specification. More specific guidance on specification related to the local conditions can be given in a national annex.
    ISO 22965-1:2007 does not apply to concrete with a maximum aggregate size equal to or less than 4 mm or 5 mm (mortar), aerated concrete, foamed concrete, concrete with an open structure ("no-fine aggregate" concrete), concrete with a density less than 800 kg/m3 and refractory concrete.
    ISO 22965-1:2007 does not cover health and safety requirements for the protection of workers during production and delivery of concrete.
