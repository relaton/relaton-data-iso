abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: This document provides a method for the evaluation of the resistance to
    hydrogen embrittlement (i.e. hydrogen delayed fracture) using constant loading
    test with hydrogen pre-charged specimens. The amount of hydrogen content absorbed
    in the specimens is analysed quantitatively by thermal desorption analysis such
    as gas chromatography, mass spectrometry and so on. In the case of hydrogen continuous
    charging such as hydrogen absorption in aqueous solution at free corrosion potential,
    hydrogen absorption in atmospheric corrosion environments and hydrogen absorption
    in high pressure hydrogen gas, the evaluation method is also briefly described.
    This method is mainly applicable to the evaluation of hydrogen embrittlement resistance
    of high strength steel bolts.
