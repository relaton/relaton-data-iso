    This document contains specifications for a set of ITS station security services required to ensure the authenticity of the source and integrity of information exchanged between trusted entities:
    —          devices operated as bounded secured managed entities, i.e. "ITS Station Communication Units" (ITS-SCU) and "ITS station units" (ITS-SU) specified in ISO 21217, and
    —          between ITS-SUs (composed of one or several ITS-SCUs) and external trusted entities such as sensor and control networks.
    These services include authentication and secure session establishment which are required to exchange information in a trusted and secure manner.
    These services are essential for many ITS applications and services including time-critical safety applications, automated driving, remote management of ITS stations (ISO 24102-2[5]), and roadside/infrastructure related services.
