    ISO/TS 17536-2 defines standardized and repeatable test procedures for the evaluation of blowby oil aerosol separators and filtering devices and specifies laboratory gravimetric separation efficiency and system pressure tests in both open and closed crankcase ventilation systems. ISO/TS 17536-2 has a limitation of 0 % to 99 % for aerosol gravimetric efficiency.
    NOTE       Gravimetric efficiencies >99 % may be difficult to measure due to long test durations and absolute filter weight measurements.
    Filter life is not evaluated in ISO/TS 17536-2.
    This test method only applies to devices that have a defined tubular inlet, outlet and drain that can be connected to the test equipment. For devices that lack such connections, for example, one that is built into a valve cover, see Annex A.
