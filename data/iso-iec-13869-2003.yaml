    ISO/IEC 13869:2003 specifies the signalling protocol for the support of the Call Transfer supplementary service (SS-CT) at the Q reference point between Private Integrated Network services eXchanges (PINXs) connected together within a Private Integrated Services Network (PISN).
    SS-CT is a supplementary service which enables a User to transform two of that User's calls (at least one of which must be answered) into a new call between the two other users in the two calls.
    The Q reference point is defined in ISO/IEC 11579-1.
    Service specifications are produced in three stages and according to the method specified in ETS 300 387. ISO/IEC 13869:2003 contains the stage 3 specification for the Q reference point and satisfies the requirements identified by the stage 1 and stage 2 specifications in ISO/IEC 13865.
    The signalling protocol for SS-CT operates on top of the signalling protocol for basic circuit switched call control, as specified in ISO/IEC 11572, and uses certain aspects of the generic procedures for the control of supplementary services specified in ISO/IEC 11582.
    ISO/IEC 13869:2003 also specifies additional signalling protocol requirements for the support of interactions at the Q reference point between Call Transfer and other supplementary services and ANFs.
    ISO/IEC 13869:2003 is applicable to PINXs which can interconnect to form a PISN.
