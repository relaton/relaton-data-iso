    ISO/TR 27912:2016 describes the principles and information necessary to clarify the CO2 capture system and provide stakeholders with the guidance and knowledge necessary for the development of a series of standards for CO2 capture. This Technical Report also covers technologies, equipment and processes specific to CO2 capture from the viewpoints of the international standardization for the implementation of CCS.
    The purpose of this Technical Report is to provide guidance for the development of an ISO document related to CO2 capture as part of a CCS chain. This Technical Report covers CO2 capture systems applicable to CO2 emission sources and their respective boundaries, as well as capture technologies, equipment and processes. In addition, it can be used for the development of International Standards under TC 265.
    The following issues are to be excluded from this Technical Report:
    -      industrial use of CO2;
    -      compression of CO2 (not described in detail);
    -      terminologies not used in this Technical Report.
