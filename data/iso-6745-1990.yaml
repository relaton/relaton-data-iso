  content: 'Relates to zinc phosphate pigments suitable for use in corrosion-inhibiting
    paints. Are classified as one of the following three types: loss on ignition at
    600 ° centigrade greater than 8.5 % (m/m), but less than or equal to 10.0 % (m/m),
    loss on ignition at 600 ° centigrade greater than 10.0 % (m/m), but less than
    or equal to 13.0 % (m/m), loss on ignition at 600 ° centigrade greater than 13.0
    % (m/m), but less than or equal to 16.0 % (m/m). The required characteristics
    are given in tables. Describes the determination of loss on ignition, the determination
    of zinc and of phosphate contents. For the determination of the phosphate content,
    the gravimetric method shall be used as the referee method.'
