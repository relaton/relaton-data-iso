    The present document refers to the panel-to-structure and panel-to panel connections used for the cladding systems of reinforced concrete frame structures of single-storey buildings, typically precast. They can be used also for multi-storey buildings with proper modifications.
    The fastening devices considered in the present document consist mainly of steel elements or sliding connectors. Dissipative devices with friction or plastic behaviour are also considered. Other types of common supports and bond connections are treated where needed.
    The use of any other existing fastening types or the connections with different characteristics than those described in the following clauses is not allowed unless comparable experimental and analytical studies do provide the necessary data and verify the design methodology for the particular type.
