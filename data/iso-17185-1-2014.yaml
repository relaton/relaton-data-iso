    ISO 17185-1:2014 defines the framework for the realization of efficient public transport user information provision to surface public transport users including international worldwide travellers.
    In the surface public transport user information provision area, a set of regional and national standards have already been established by related regional and national standardizing bodies.
    ISO 17185-1:2014 defines basic framework for user information provision for surface public transport users, from the viewpoint that the surface public transport users should be provided with proper static and real-time information when it is most desired and effective. In order to realize the desirable information provision, surface public transport information has to be efficiently gathered, processed, and provided to surface public transport users in an appropriate way by using currently available regional standards.
    ISO 17185-1:2014 does not aim to define a new part of ISO 17185 that supersede current regional and national standards related to surface public transport. It aims to define the basic framework of surface public transport user information provision by esteeming existing regional standards and wisely using them.
    ISO 17185-1:2014 does not aim to define specific information interfaces such as data format or a stop point numbering system. The currently available regional standards established by regional and national groups are suggested to be applied in that scope.
