    This document specifies the principal dimensional characteristics of V-ribbed pulley groove profiles, together with the corresponding endless V-ribbed belts of PK profile which are used predominantly for automotive accessory drive applications.
    This document does not apply to the complete array of V-ribbed belts and pulleys of PH, PJ, PK, PL and PM profile for industrial and other non-automotive applications which are covered by ISO 9982. PK belt profile dimensions and tolerances are the same in both International Standards.
    6.2 and 6.3 of this document do not apply to elastic belts.
