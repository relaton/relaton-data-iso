abstract:
- content: |-
    This document specifies a general framework for the security evaluation of quantum key distribution (QKD) according to the ISO/IEC 15408 series. Specifically, it specifies a baseline set of common security functional requirements (SFRs) for QKD modules, including SFRs on the conventional network components and the quantum optical components, and the entire implementation of QKD protocols. To facilitate the analysis of SFRs, security problems that QKD modules can face in their operational environment are analysed based on a structural analysis of the security functionality of QKD modules and the classification of QKD protocols.
    The SFRs on conventional network components of QKD modules are mainly characterized under the framework of the ISO/IEC 15408 series and also refer to the methodology of ISO/IEC 19790 and relevant standards on testing of cryptographic modules and network devices.
