    This document specifies requirements for lava abrasives, as supplied for blast-cleaning processes. It specifies ranges of particle sizes and values for apparent density, Mohs hardness, moisture content, conductivity of aqueous extract and water-soluble chlorides.
    The requirements specified in this document apply to abrasives supplied in the "new" condition only. They do not apply to abrasives either during or after use.
    Test methods for non-metallic blast-cleaning abrasives are given in the various parts of ISO 11127.
