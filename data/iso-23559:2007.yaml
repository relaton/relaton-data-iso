    ISO 23559:2007 identifies specific test procedures to assist producers and users in the selection and characterization of thermoplastic films in single- or multi-layer form. It is intended to serve as a guide for those films for which there are no existing standards or specifications.
    NOTE          Because of the range of materials used and the wide variety of processes available to produce various film constructions, the standard does not address specimen preparation.
