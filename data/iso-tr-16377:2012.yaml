abstract:
- content: ISO/TR 16377:2012 seeks to document elements of clarification to ISO 28580:2009
    where consensus exists. Other suggestions for clarification will demand further
    work and consensus building and are not included in ISO/TR 16377:2012. Although
    it is expected that these clarifications will be adopted in future revisions to
    ISO 28580, they are intended only as guidance for the user.
