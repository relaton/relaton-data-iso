- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: Specifies the basic principles and limitations which govern operations
    with fissile materials. Describes general criticality safety criteria for equipment
    design and for the development of operating controls. Does not cover quality assurance
    requirements or details of equipment or operational procedures, does not deal
    with the effects of radiation on man or materials.These criteria apply to operations
    with fissile materials outside nuclear reactors but within the boundaries of nuclear
    facilities. Replaces the first edition, which has been technically revised.
