    This document specifies requirements for the classification and grading of civil unmanned aircraft system (UAS). This document applies to heavier than air aircraft as well as lighter than air aircraft of any possible architecture.
    This document applies to the industrial conception, development, design, production and delivery of civil UAS. It also applies to modification, repair and maintenance of civil UAS.
    The characteristics in this document can be used individually or in combination, to meet specific needs of the classification and grading of civil UAS.
    Risk-based categorization of UAS operations is prerogative of the aviation authorities and it is hence out of scope of this document.
