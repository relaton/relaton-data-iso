    ISO 21015:2007 specifies test methods for determining the stability, strength and durability of office work chairs. Guidance is given on the choice of forces, cycles, etc., for these tests.
    The tests are designed to be applied to an article of furniture that is fully assembled and ready for use.
    The dimensions in the tests are applicable to office work chairs intended for adult persons.
    The tests consist of the application, to various parts of the item, of forces simulating normal functional use, as well as misuse that can reasonably be expected to occur.
    The tests are designed to evaluate properties without regard to materials, design/construction or manufacturing processes.
    The test results are valid only for the article tested. When the test results are intended to be applied to other similar articles, it is important that the test specimen be representative of the production model.
    Tests carried out according to ISO 21015:2007 are intended to demonstrate the ability of the item to give satisfactory service in its intended environment. The tests have been developed for units/components that have not been in use. However, when properly justified, they can be used for fault investigation.
    Data are given for the design of seat loading pads and for the design of stability loading pad.
    ISO 21015:2007 does not give any product requirements. These can be specified in a requirements document. If this is not available, possible forces and cycles are suggested. These forces and cycles can be used for adults regardless of their weight and number of working hours.
    ISO 21015:2007 does not specify type approval tests for chair components.
    Assessment of ageing and degradation is not included. The tests are not intended to assess the durability of upholstery, i.e. filling materials and covers.
