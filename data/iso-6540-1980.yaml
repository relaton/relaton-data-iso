abstract:
- content: A section one specifies the reference method. It consists in grinding of
    sample, if necessery, after pre-conditioning, if required, then drying of a test
    portion at a temperature between 130 and 133 C under conditions which enable a
    result to be obtained which is in agreement with that obtained by the absolute
    method ( prescribed in an annex). A section two specifies the routine method on
    whole grains. It consists in drying of whole grains for 38 h at a temperature
    between 130 and 133 C.
