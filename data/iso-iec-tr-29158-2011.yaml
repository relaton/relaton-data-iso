  content: |-
    ISO/IEC TR 29158:2011 is an engineering document intended for verifier manufacturers and application specification developers.
    It describes modifications which are to be considered in conjunction with the symbol quality methodology defined in ISO/IEC 15415 and a symbology specification. It defines alternative illumination conditions, some new terms and parameters, modifications to the measurement and grading of certain parameters, and the reporting of the grading results.
    ISO/IEC TR 29158:2011 was developed to assess the symbol quality of direct marked parts, where the mark is applied directly to the surface of the item and the reading device is a two-dimensional imager.
    When application specifications allow, this method may also be applied to symbols produced by other methods. This is appropriate when direct part marked (DPM) symbols and non-DPM symbols are being scanned in the same scanning environment. The symbol grade is reported as a DPM grade rather than as an ISO/IEC 15415 grade.
