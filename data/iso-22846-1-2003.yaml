abstract:
- content: ISO 22846-1:2003 gives the fundamental principles for the use of rope access
    methods for work at height. It is intended for use by employers, employees and
    self-employed persons who use rope-access methods, by those commissioning rope-access
    work and by rope-access associations. ISO 22846-1 is applicable to the use of
    rope-access methods on buildings, other structures (on- or offshore) or natural
    features (such as cliff faces), during which ropes are suspended from or connected
    to a structure or natural feature. It is applicable to situations where ropes
    are used as the primary means of access, egress or support and as the primary
    means of protection against a fall. ISO 22846-1 is not intended to apply to the
    use of rope-access methods for leisure activities, arboriculture, general steeplejack
    methods or emergency personal-evacuation systems, or to the use of rope-access
    (line rescue) techniques by the fire brigade and other emergency services for
    rescue work or for rescue training.
