    This document:
    —     provides supplemental requirements and guidance for the planning and performing of the integration processes given in ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 and ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207;
    —     provides guidance on the relationship between the integration process and other life cycle processes.
    —     specifies requirements for information items to be produced as a result of using the integration process, including the content of the information items.
    This document is applicable to:
    —     those who use or plan to use ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207 or ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288, or both, on projects dealing with human-made systems, software-intensive systems, and products and services related to those systems, regardless of the project scope, methodology, size, or complexity;
    —     anyone planning or performing integration activities to aid in ensuring that the application of the integration process and its relationships to other system life cycle processes conform to ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 or ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207.
