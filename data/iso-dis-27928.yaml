  content: "1. Scope:\nThis document is a part of a series of standards for carbon
    dioxide (CO2) capture. It specifies methods for measuring, evaluating and reporting
    the performance of CO2 capture plant connected to a CO2 intensive plant, and which
    separate CO2 from the CO2 intensive plant exhaust gas in preparation for subsequent
    transportation and geological storage. In particular, it provides a common methodology
    to calculate specific key performance indicators for the CO2 capture plant, requiring
    the definition of the boundaries of a typical system and the measurements needed
    to determine the KPIs.\n\n2. Policy of work:\nThe series of standards for carbon
    dioxide capture will be done based on the following fundamental policies:\n(1)
    The standards and requirements being developed in the series will depend on the
    maturity of the content and its practical use to stakeholders.\n(2) Standards
    in the series will build on the previous standards. \n(3) Standards for CO2 capture
    lend themselves better to a series of individual standards rather than a single
    comprehensive standard because of the maturity of the technologies and the process
    differences in power and different Energy Intensive Industries (EII)."
