abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: ISO 1996-2:2017 describes how sound pressure levels intended as a basis
    for assessing environmental noise limits or comparison of scenarios in spatial
    studies can be determined. Determination can be done by direct measurement and
    by extrapolation of measurement results by means of calculation. This document
    is primarily intended to be used outdoors but some guidance is given for indoor
    measurements as well. It is flexible and to a large extent, the user determines
    the measurement effort and, accordingly, the measurement uncertainty, which is
    determined and reported in each case. Thus, no limits for allowable maximum uncertainty
    are set up. Often, the measurement results are combined with calculations to correct
    for reference operating or propagation conditions different from those during
    the actual measurement. This document can be applied on all kinds of environmental
    noise sources, such as road and rail traffic noise, aircraft noise and industrial
    noise.
