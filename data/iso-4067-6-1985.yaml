- content: Establishes basic symbols for conduits, pipes and ditches including fabricated
    parts and equipment. Symbols are shown and used primaily in plans, but they can
    in applicable cases also be used in sections, cuts and elevations. This part of
    ISO 4067 will be modified as soon as results are available from the work concerning
    the coordination of symbols for use in drawings in all technical areas.
