  content: ISO/TR 12309:2009 specifies principles and processes that should be exhibited
    by developers of healthcare terminologies in support of international healthcare
    terminology standardization. The primary target group for ISO/TR 12309:2009 is
    those establishing or reviewing organizations, and those evaluating the services
    or products maintained by such organizations, in the context of international
    healthcare terminology standardization. It complements standards such as ISO 17115
    and ISO 17117 (which address the content of terminologies) by specifying good
    governance requirements for the lifecycle of those terminologies.
