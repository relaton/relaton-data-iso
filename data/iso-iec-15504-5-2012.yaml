  content: "ISO/IEC 15504-5:2012 provides an example of a Process Assessment Model
    for use in performing a conformant assessment in accordance with the requirements
    of ISO/IEC 15504-2.  \nISO/IEC 15504-5:2012 provides a detailed description of
    the structure and key components of the Process Assessment Model, which includes
    two dimensions: a process dimension and a capability dimension. It also introduces
    assessment indicators.\nISO/IEC 15504-5:2012 uses process definitions from ISO/IEC
    12207:2008 to identify a Process Reference Model. The processes of the Process
    Reference Model are described in the Process Assessment Model in terms of purpose
    and outcomes and are grouped in three process categories. The Process Assessment
    Model expands the Process Reference Model process definitions by including a set
    of process performance indicators called base practices for each process. The
    Process Assessment Model also defines a second set of indicators of process performance
    by associating work products with each process. \nISO/IEC 15504-5:2012 duplicates
    the definitions of the capability levels and process attributes from ISO/IEC 15504-2,
    and expands each of the nine attributes through the inclusion of a set of generic
    practices. These generic practices belong to a set of indicators of process capability,
    in association with generic resource indicators, and generic work product indicators.\nISO/IEC
    15504-5:2012 also provides the following:\n- a statement of conformance of the
    Process Assessment Model to the requirements defined in ISO/IEC 15504-2;\n- selected
    characteristics for typical work products to assist the assessor in evaluating
    the capability level of processes;\n- style guides for defining base practices,
    work products and generic practices for adjusting the Process Assessment Model,
    and guidance explaining how to expand or adapt the model;\n- some processes supplementary
    to the Process Assessment Model."
