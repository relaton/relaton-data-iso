    This document specifies the measurement of the output of a UV-C lamp, types of UV-C lamp, lamp ballast, and safety issues.
    It is applicable to the output measurement of linear UV-C disinfection lamps.
    This document specifies a measurement method for evaluating output power of UV-C lamps installed in heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. The method includes the simulation measurement of UV-C output power of UV-C lamps under various temperatures and various air velocities, and under conditions that the axial direction of the lamp is parallel or perpendicular to the air flow direction. It can reliably evaluate and compare the UV-C output power of UV-C lamps in the ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) device based on the testing results. If the microbial inactivation rate of a particular UVGI device equipped with the same type of UV-C lamp is known, the microbial inactivation rate of the UVGI device at various temperatures and at various air velocities can be evaluated.
