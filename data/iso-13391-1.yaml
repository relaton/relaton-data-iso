    This document specifies how calculations of different parts can be combined into a carbon balance calculation for the entire value chain related to wood and wood-based products.
    NOTE This document will gradually mature over time as methodology evolves.
    This document sets general requirements and overarching terminology.
    This document includes information on how to bring calculation results forward in the value
    chain. It also includes information on how claims and declarations can be worded based on this standard, both within the value chain and to customers and consumers.
