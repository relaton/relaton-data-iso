- content: |-
    This document specifies how to calculate the greenhouse gas dynamics of a set of wood and wood-based products on the organizational or aggregated level (the area of study). It includes the greenhouse gas emissions, greenhouse gas removals, or carbon pools related to:
    —     one or multiple forest management unit(s),
    —     harvested wood product(s),
    —     value chain(s), and
    —     potential displacement of greenhouse gas emissions from alternative products replaced by wood-based products.
    Together, these four components represent the greenhouse gas dynamics of a set of wood and wood-based products.
    This document sets general requirements and provides overarching terminology.
    This document specifies the different components of a greenhouse gas dynamics calculation.
    This document includes information on how claims and declarations can be communicated based on this document, both within the value chain and to customers and consumers.
    This document is intended to be used by organizations seeking to understand, commit to or contribute to climate change mitigation. These organizations can be either private or public, regardless of type or size, and located in any jurisdiction or any position within a specific value chain.
