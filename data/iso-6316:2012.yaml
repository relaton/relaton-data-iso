    1SO 6316:2012 specifies requirements for hot-rolled steel strip of structural quality, usually without the use of microalloying elements. This product is intended for structural purposes where particular mechanical properties are required. It is generally used in the delivered condition and is intended for bolted, riveted or welded structures. It is commonly rolled on a narrow strip mill.
    1SO 6316:2012 does not cover steels designated as commercial quality or drawing quality (covered in ISO 6317) or steels intended for boilers or pressure vessels, or steels to be rerolled to cold-reduced products, or steels designated as weathering steels, having increased atmospheric corrosion resistance.
