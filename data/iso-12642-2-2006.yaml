  content: ISO 12642-2:2006 defines a data set of ink value combinations that is intended
    to be used to characterize four-colour process printing. This data set is not
    optimized for any printing process or application area but is robust enough for
    all general applications. The needs of publication, commercial, and package printing
    with offset, gravure, flexography, and other printing processes have been considered.
    While it is primarily aimed at process colour printing with CMYK inks, it can
    also be used with any combination of three chromatic coloured inks and a dark
    ink. It is an alternate to the ISO 12642-1 data set where more robust data is
    required.
