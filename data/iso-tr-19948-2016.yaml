abstract:
- content: |-
    ISO/TR 19948:2016 presents a process for conformity assessment and certification for earth-moving machinery as defined in ISO 6165. This includes a presentation of the characteristics of standards to be used for conformity assessment of the machines, a process for testing to demonstrate compliance with those standards, and a process for third party certification where such certification is required.
    The global objective for the earth-moving machinery industry is acceptance and use of supplier's declarations of conformity (SDoC) according to ISO/IEC 17050. This document includes provisions for third party certification in countries or regions where SDoC is not accepted.
