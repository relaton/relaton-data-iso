abstract:
- content: "Abstract: Industry Foundation Classes (IFC2x) Platform Specification\nThe
    IFC2x Platform Specification provides an information model, written in EXPRESS
    (ISO 10303-11:1994), for sharing data in the construction and facilities management
    industries. Content is currently exchanged between IFC compliant software applications
    using the Clear text encoding of the exchange structure, the STEP Part 21 physical
    file (ISO 10303-21:1994), or by database access using the Standard Data Access
    Interface, the SDAI (ISO 10303-22:1998).\nThe intended scope of the IFC specification
    is the project life-cycle of construction facilities, including all phases as
    identified by generic process protocols for the construction and facilities management
    industries, such as: Demonstrating the need, Conception of need, Outline feasibility,
    Substantive feasibility study and outline financial authority, Outline conceptual
    design, Full conceptual design, Coordinated design, procurement and full financial
    authority, Production information, Construction, Operation and maintenance [Generic
    Process Protocol]. \nThe IFC specification aims at supporting the different disciplines
    that participate in the project life-cycle, such as architecture, building services
    (HVAC - heating, ventilation, air conditioning, cooling, electrical), building
    automation, structural analysis and engineering, quantity take-off and cost estimation,
    construction planning and scheduling, project handover and facilities management.
    \nThe IFC specification is developed in a release cycle, the IFC2x platform specification
    represents a particular release of the IFC specification. It supports the coordination
    between the major design disciplines and the handover to facilities management.
    Future releases of the IFC specification will cover more life-cycle phases and
    construction disciplines.\nThe specification of the IFC specification is clustered
    by schemas (logical packages) of subsets of the information model and it is published
    as HTML based online documentation. The implementation of the IFC specification
    is based on the combination of all schemas (the longform), and it is provided
    by the mandatory EXPRESS schema. The IAI publishes additional informational documents
    that are not part of ISO/PAS 16739, such as the IFC model development guide, the
    IFC model implementation guide, the IFC property set guide, see www.iai-international.org
    for further information.\nParts of the IFC2x platform specification, mainly the
    shape representation, have been adopted from other international standards, namely
    from ISO 10303-42:1994 and ISO 10303-43:1994."
