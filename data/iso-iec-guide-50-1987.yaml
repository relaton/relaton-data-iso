  content: 'This Guide establishes basic safety principles for technical bodies preparing
    national and international standards for products which are intended specifically
    for use by children; these principles should also apply to products with which
    children are likely to come into contact. The following aspects are considered:
    ergonomic considerations, toxicity, flammability and thermal injuries, ingestion
    and inhalation of foreign bodies, mechanical hazards and construction features,
    electrical safety, radiation, marking and labelling, packaging, marketing. Annex
    A includes a list of possible preventive measures for specific types of product-related
    accidents.'
