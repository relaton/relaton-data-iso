    This document defines a quality-in-use model composed of three characteristics (which are further subdivided into sub-characteristics) that can influence stakeholders when products or systems are used in a specified context of use. This model is applicable to the entire spectrum of information system and IT service system, including both computer systems in use and software products in use.
    This document provides a set of quality characteristics for specifying, measuring, evaluating and improving quality-in-use.
    In this document, because context of use is specified as prerequisite of quality-in-use, context of use is necessary to be re-specified to change prerequisite when a product or service intend to fulfil to context of use changes.
    The model can be applied, in particular, by those responsible for specifying and evaluating software product quality, such as developers, acquirers, quality assurance and control staff, and independent evaluators. Activities during product development that can benefit from the use of the quality model can include, but are not limited to:
    —     identifying requirements for information system and IT service system in use;
    —     validating the comprehensiveness of a quality-in-use requirements specification;
    —     identifying information system and IT service system design objectives for quality-in-use;
    —     identifying quality-in-use control criteria as part of overall quality assurance;
    —     identifying acceptance criteria for information system and IT service system or information systems;
    —     establishing measures to address the consequences of using products in specified context-of -use;
    —     presenting evaluation items for ethics considerations when using information system and IT service system;
    —     supporting governance of digitalization activities.
