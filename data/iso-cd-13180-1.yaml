abstract:
- content: "This document specifies a test method for evaluating direct tensile resistance
    of strain-hardening fiber-reinforced cementitious composites (FRCCs) using tensile
    parameters. The tensile parameters are determined from the measured tensile stress
    versus strain curve obtained by testing a specimen under uniaxial tension without
    any parasitic bending moment during the test. \nThis test method provides tensile
    stress versus strain curve, first cracking strength, post cracking strength, strain
    capacity (strain at post cracking point), toughness (area under tensile stress
    versus strain curve until post cracking point) and the number of cracks within
    gauge length. This test method is intended primarily for use with FRCCs that exhibit
    strain-hardening behaviour. This test method is not intended for materials that
    exhibit strain-softening behaviour."
