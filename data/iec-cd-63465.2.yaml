    This International Standard specifies the techniques for calibration and usage of pressurised, well-type ionisation chambers for the assay of radionuclides. Such instruments are used to determine the activity, expressed in becquerel (Bq), of photon and some medium to high-energy beta emitting radionuclides.

    This document provides the methods and tests for establishing and maintaining acceptable instrument performance. Performance benchmarks vary depending on the user type and application, so information specific to end-users, production-level users, standards laboratories, and instrument manufacturers is provided.
