    The purpose of this document is to describe test plans and different operating methodologies of these test plans to define and verify the acceptable length of stability of a substance in a sample under specified conditions of preservation (temperature, matrix, light, addition of a stabilizer, where appropriate, type of preservation etc.) before starting analytical protocols (chemicals and physico-chemicals analysis). Biological and microbiological methods are excluded.
    It is necessary to have an analytical method with performances that have already been characterized (repeatability, intermediate precision, trueness, accuracy and uncertainty) in order to perform the stability study and implement its test plans.
