    This document describes extensions to the C++ Programming Language (Clause 2) that enable operations on source code. These extensions include new syntactic forms and modifications to existing language semantics, as well as changes and additions to the existing library facilities.
    Instructions to modify or add paragraphs are written as explicit instructions. Modifications made directly to existing text from ISO/IEC 14882:2020 use underlining to represent added text and strikethrough to represent deleted text.
