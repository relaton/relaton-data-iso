  content: |-
    ISO/TS 8000-120:2009 specifies requirements for the
    representation and exchange of information about the provenance of
    master data that consists of characteristic data, and supplements
    the requirements of ISO 8000-110. Provenance is the history or
    pedigree of a property value. Any claim of conformance to ISO/TS
    8000-120:2009 implies a claim of conformance to ISO 8000-110.
    ISO/TS 8000-120:2009 includes a Unified Modeling Language (UML)
    conceptual model for provenance data. Just as provenance is a key
    element of the value of a work of art, it is also a key element of
    the value of data. It allows the recipient of a master data message
    to trace master data that has been exchanged back to its source,
    and helps the recipient to assess the trustworthiness of the data,
    and make a choice when values for the same property are received
    from different sources.
