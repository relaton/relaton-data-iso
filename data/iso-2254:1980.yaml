abstract:
- content: Gives the definition, classification and designation of shaped insulating
    refratory materials. According to the definition they have a total porosity of
    at least 45%. One distinguishes between high alumina products, fireclay and siliceous
    fireclay products, semi-silica products, silica products, basic products and special
    products. High alumina, fireclay and siliceous fireclay products are subdivided
    depending on the temperature at which the material does not show any permanent
    linear change in dimension greater than 2% at the end of a conventional test.
