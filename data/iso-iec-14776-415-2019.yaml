  content: This standard defines PHY and MAC specifications for high data rate wireless
    connectivity (typically over 200 Mbps) with fixed, portable, and moving devices.
    Data rates are high enough to satisfy a set of consumer multimedia industry needs,
    as well as to support emerging wireless switched point-to-point and high rate
    close proximity point-to-point applications.
