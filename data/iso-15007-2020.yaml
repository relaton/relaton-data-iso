    This document defines key terms and parameters applied in the analysis of driver visual behaviour focused on glance and glance-related measures. It provides guidelines and minimum requirements on equipment and procedures for analysing driver visual behaviour including assessment of TICS to:
    —     plan evaluation trials;
    —     specify (and install) data capture equipment; and
    —     validate, analyse, interpret and report visual-behaviour metrics (standards of measurement).
    The parameters and definitions described below provide a common source of reference for driver visual behaviour data.
    It is applicable to on-road trials (e.g. field operational tests or naturalistic studies), and laboratory-based driving studies. The procedures described in this document can also apply to more general assessments of driver visual behaviour. Data collected and analysed according to this document will allow comparisons to be performed across different TICS applications and experimental scenarios.
