abstract:
- content: |-
    This International Standard specifies the functional requirements of a range of high-pressure pipes for use on
    benches for the testing and setting of fuel injection pumps intended for diesel engines.
    Only dimensions and requirements affecting the hydraulic characteristics of the pipes are specified. Other
    requirements, such as the type of end connections or shape of the pipes when bent, are not included as these
    depend on the connections provided on the pump outlets and injector inlets, and on the design features of
    individual pumps and test benches.
    This International Standard applies to a range of pipes to enable the pump engine manufacturer to choose a
    suitable type of pipe for pump deliveries up to 300 mm3/stroke/cylinder. The particular pipe to be used shall be
    identified by the pump manufacturer in the test schedule for each individual pump type and application.
