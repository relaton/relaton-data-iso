  content: 'Specifies three types of pigment consisting predominantly of cadmium sulfide
    or of mixed crystals of cadmium sulfide and cadmium selenide; the cadmium may
    be partially replaced by zinc. Type 1, concentrated pigments, contain not more
    than 30 % (m/m) of extenders: type 2, extended pigments, contain not more than
    70 % (m/m) of extenders: type 3, these are essentially pure and do not contain
    any extenders and are mainly suitable for use in ceramics.'
