  content: "ISO 13183:2012 specifies the architectural communications framework of
    intelligent transport systems (ITS) for the family of communications access for
    land mobiles (CALM) related International Standards. The architecture is described
    in an abstract way with several graphical views and examples. The graphical representations
    partly follow the ISO open systems interconnection (OSI) principles. \nIn addition
    to the requirements specified within ISO 13183:2012, a number of notes and examples
    are provided to illustrate the CALM concept. "
