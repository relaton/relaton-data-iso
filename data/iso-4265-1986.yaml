  content: The method used is applicable to products containing any of the phosphorus
    compounds in normal use and having contents between O,OO5 and 1O,O % (m/m). The
    method is free from most interferences because the high insolubility of the quinoline
    phosphomolybdate precipitate leads to constant composition and freedom from most
    adsorbed or occulated impurities, especially from cations which would otherwise
    interfere in the subsequent titration of the precipitate.
