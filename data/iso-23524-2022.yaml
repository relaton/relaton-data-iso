    1.1 This document specifies the principles and the method for determining the fracture toughness of polymeric films and thin sheets in the crack opening mode (mode I) under plane stress conditions. The essential work of fracture (EWF) method is based on the use of double edge notched tensile (DENT) specimens.
    1.2 The method is suitable for use with films or thin sheets, of thickness not greater than 1 mm, made of ductile polymeric materials, in which fracture propagation is stable (crack growth is always driven by the external applied force). If, at any time during the test, brittle fracture occurs, with fast crack propagation driven by the elastic energy stored in the specimen, the sample is not suitable for the application of the present test method.
