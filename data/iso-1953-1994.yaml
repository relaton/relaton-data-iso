abstract:
- content: Specifies reference methods for the size analysis of coal by manual sieving
    (wet or dry), using test sieves of aperture sizes between 125 mm and 45 µm. A
    guide to sampling is given in annex A and notes on the use of mechanical sieving
    are given in annex B. Is applicable to all hard coals. Is not applicable to coke
    or other manufactured fuels. In the case of pulverized coal, the methods described
    will determine only the percentage of oversize.
