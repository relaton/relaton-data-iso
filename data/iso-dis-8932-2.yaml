  content: "The purpose of this International Standard is to provide a test method
    for the calibration of radiosonde humidity sensors with varying temperature and
    relative humidity using laboratory setups. The main scope of this International
    Standard is as follows:\na)\tTechnical requirements for laboratory setups needed
    for the calibration of radiosonde humidity sensors.\nb)\tTest procedure for calibrating
    radiosonde humidity sensors with varying temperature and relative humidity.\nc)\tUncertainty
    evaluation method for the calibration of radiosonde humidity sensors.\nTo be more
    specific, in part (a), the requirements for an absolute humidity generator, a
    test cell, and a precision hygrometer as essential laboratory setups are proposed.
    In part (b), the test procedure includes the installation of radiosondes in the
    test cell, the operation of laboratory setups, and the comparison between the
    reference relative humidity and the relative humidity measurement by radiosondes.
    In part (c), the method to evaluate uncertainties related with the reference relative
    humidity and the radiosonde humidity sensor will be proposed."
