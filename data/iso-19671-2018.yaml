    This document specifies a method of assessing the effect or compatibility of an additional or personal lubricant with lubricated male natural rubber latex condoms. It also applies to topical medicines and any other substances that come into contact with such condoms. It describes the measurement of changes in physical properties of the condoms after exposure to the test substance (i.e. lubricant, topical medicine, etc.) and specifies the pass/fail criteria for such changes.
    This document is not applicable to the assessment of the compatibility of lubricants applied to a condom at the time of manufacture. It is not directly applicable to the assessment of the compatibility of a particular condom with lubricants or other substances. It is not directly applicable to tests using female condoms, although similar principles can apply.
    The test methods are applicable to condoms made from natural rubber latex and from synthetic materials, but a pass/fail criterion is only stipulated for natural rubber latex.
