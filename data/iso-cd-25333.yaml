    This document specifies a uniform, reproducible testing process for various drive units, chassis, constructions and attached parts as well as sweeping systems of the sweepers described in ISO 24147, with which a comparison of the energy consumption levels can be performed.
    This defines a representative test circuit and/or test bench cycle with which the energy consumption levels of the sweepers to be inspected can be evaluated and compared within the scope of reproducible test trips and/or test bench runs.
