abstract:
- content: This part of ISO17123 specifies a field procedure for the verification
    that a given Global Navigation Systems (GNSS) -based system and measurement procedure
    meets a required measurement uncertainty at the location and time of interest.
    The field procedure uses three-dimensional coordinates which are compared to reference
    coordinates. It is designed to be applicable to the technically versatile GNSS
    systems on the market and can be used for any kind of GNSS based coordinate determination
    application, not only geodetic. It is independent of the technology used in the
    GNSS measuring instrument, the satellite data streams, and any correction data
    used. The procedure is applicable to GNSS instruments under use conditions in
    the field in such a way, that the main parameters affecting the determination
    of coordinates are included in the result of the test. Several delimination criteria
    defined by the document allow a versatile applicability so the verification procedure
    can be performed regurarly in the fielw with limited economic impact.
