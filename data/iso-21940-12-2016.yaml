abstract:
- content: |-
    ISO 21940-12:2016 presents typical configurations of rotors with flexible behaviour in accordance with their characteristics and balancing requirements, describes balancing procedures, specifies methods of assessment of the final state of balance, and establishes guidelines for balance quality criteria.
    ISO 21940-12:2016 can also serve as a basis for more involved investigations, e.g. when a more exact determination of the required balance quality is necessary. If due regard is paid to the specified methods of manufacture and balance tolerances, satisfactory running conditions can be expected.
    ISO 21940-12:2016 is not intended to serve as an acceptance specification for any rotor, but rather to give indications of how to avoid gross deficiencies and unnecessarily restrictive requirements.
    Structural resonances and modifications thereof lie outside the scope of this part of ISO 21940.
    The methods and criteria given are the result of experience with general industrial machinery. It is possible that they are not directly applicable to specialized equipment or to special circumstances. Therefore, in some cases, deviations from this part of ISO 21940 are possible.
