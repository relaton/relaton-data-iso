    This document specifies the basic requirements of thermal insulation design of reactor coolant system (RCS) equipment and piping.
    Among thermal insulation of various RCS equipment and piping, the following two kinds of thermal insulations are described in detailed based on common design logic and requirements:
    —     thermal insulation of reactor pressure vessel (RPV);
    —     thermal insulation of RCS piping and other equipment.
    This document is valid for two types of thermal insulation:
    —     metallic thermal insulation;
    —     non-metallic thermal insulation.
    This document mainly applies to nuclear power plants with pressurized water reactor (PWR). For other reactor types, this document can be taken as reference.
