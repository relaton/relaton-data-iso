  content: "ISO 13419:2003 specifies the requirements for spacecraft packet telemetry
    systems. Packet telemetry is a concept which facilitates the transmission of space-acquired
    data from source to user in a standardized highly automated manner. Packet telemetry
    provides a mechanism for implementing common data transport structures and protocols,
    which may enhance the development and operation of space mission systems.\nISO
    13419:2003 addresses two processes: the end-to-end transport of space mission
    data sets from source application processes located in space to distributed user
    application processes located on the ground, and the intermediate transfer of
    these data sets through space data acquisition networks, which contain spacecraft,
    radio links, tracking stations, ground communications circuits and mission control
    centres as some of their components.\nISO 13419:2003 is limited to describing
    the telemetry formats, which are generated by the spacecraft in order to execute
    its role in the above processes. It includes comprehensive specification of the
    structure of data streams that are generated by remote space vehicles for telemetering
    to space mission data processing facilities (which are usually located on Earth).
    It does not attempt to define the architecture or configuration of these data
    processing facilities, except to describe assumed ground data handling services,
    which affect the selection of certain on-board formatting options.\nISO 13419:2003
    specifies a wide range of formatting capabilities, which may facilitate a high
    degree of flexibility in the design of spacecraft data acquisition systems; however,
    compatibility with the packet telemetry concept may be realized by only implementing
    a narrow subset of these capabilities. "
