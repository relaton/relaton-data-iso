  content: ISO/TR 19669:2017 specifies a use case development methodology, facilitated
    by a dynamic catalogue of re-usable components. Use cases are a basic tool in
    describing requirements for health and healthcare settings, service provision,
    information technology and software products. Use case development often follows
    a uniform template with components such as actors, roles, scenarios, event steps,
    actions, data objects/elements and requirements statements. ISO/TR 19669:2017
    includes a basic use case template and the methods of component identification,
    capture, cataloguing and re-use. This document also includes guidance for software
    designed to implement the methodology in the form of a use case authoring tool.
