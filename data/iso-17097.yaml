  content: This standard specifies terms, methods, and consideration related to the
    processing of scan data using software after acquiring human body scan data using
    a 3-D human body scanner. Digital three-dimensional (3-D) human body scan data
    are obtained by digitizing the 3-D shape of the human body collected through a
    3-D scanner in the form of point cloud. The collected point cloud data are processed
    using a digital 3-D scan data processing program and then used for anthropometric
    measurement, body shape analysis, and/or ergonomic product design. This standard
    will be useful for the software developers when they develop scan data processing
    software. It could also be helpful for anthropometric researchers and product
    designers when they establish 3-D human body scan databases to analyze the human
    body shape and size.
