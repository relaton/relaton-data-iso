    ISO 17541:2014 deals with quantitative evaluation of scratch-induced damage and scratch visibility in polymers.
    ISO 17541:2014 specifies two methods to assess scratch damage and scratch visibility expressed by three colour coordinates of a 3-D colour model.
    Method A uses a scratch tip capable of area-contact or line-contact with material surfaces under a constant load condition. It is represented by scratch damage index (SDI).
    Method B uses a scratch tip capable of line-contact under a linearly increasing load condition. It is represented by scratch visibility index (SVI).
    The methods are suitable for use with coated and uncoated thermoplastic and thermosetting moulding materials. The methods specify the preferred dimensions of testing specimens and the preferred scratch-tip geometry.
