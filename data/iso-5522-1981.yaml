  content: The method consists in acidifying and heating a test portion, entraining,
    in a current of nitrogen, the gas liberated, absorbing and oxidizing the gas by
    bubbling it through a neutral, dilute hydrogen peroxide solution, then determining
    the sulphuric acid thus formed using standard volumetric sodium hydroxide solution.
    Verification of the determination is described in the annexes A and B, respectively.
