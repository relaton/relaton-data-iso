  content: A discourse is a process of communication. ISO/TS 24617-5:2014 addresses
    how a discourse is structured in terms of its realization/presentation and content,
    and shows how its dual structure can be represented in a graph. The current specification
    focuses on the annotation of discourse structures in text only, but it can be
    extended to discourses in other modalities.
