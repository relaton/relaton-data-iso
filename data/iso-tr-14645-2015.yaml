abstract:
- content: ISO/TR 14645:2015 describes dummies, procedures, and configurations that
    can be used to investigate the interactions that occur between a deploying air
    bag and a Child Restraint System (CRS) that would have been considered properly
    installed and used in the outer and centre front passenger positions. Static tests
    can be used to sort CRS/air bag interaction on a comparative basis in either an
    actual or a simulated vehicle environment. Systems that appear to warrant further
    testing can be subjected to an appropriate dynamic test at a speed near that needed
    to deploy an air bag or at a higher speed commonly used to evaluate CRS performance.
    No test matrix is specified at this time for evaluating either a CRS or an air
    bag during interaction with each other. Instead, engineering judgment based on
    prior experience with CRS and/or air bag testing should be used in selecting the
    tests to be conducted with each individual system. Such tests can be aimed not
    only at producing interactions with the most severe results but also at identifying
    those conditions that produce the least interaction and/or satisfactory CRS performance
    results. Baseline tests to indicate the performance of a CRS in the absence of
    air bag deployment are also recommended for comparison purposes.
