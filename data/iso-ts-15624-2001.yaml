    This Technical Specification specifies system requirements for Traffic Impediment Warning Systems (TIWS). The
    purposes of the warning system are that information collected by the infrastructure is automatically and quickly
    provided to vehicles and reported to the traffic system operator, so vehicles can avoid secondary accidents. A
    major function of the system is to save lives by speedier rescue activities and, a quicker clearing up of accidentcaused
    congestion. This Technical Specification focuses on closed circuit television (CCTV) cameras as the
    sensors, to detect traffic impediments using image processing and variable message signs as the communication
    method to provide information to drivers.
