  content: The principle of the test consists in presentation to an assessor of a
    series of samples, some of which are composed of sample "A" while others are different
    from sample "A"; for each sample, the assessor has to determine whether or not
    it is identical to "A". This test requires the assessor to have evaluated a known
    sample "A" prior to the exposure to test samples. Examples of application are
    given in an annex A. An annex C shows examples of answer forms.
