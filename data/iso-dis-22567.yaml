abstract:
- content: The proposed ISO standard (on the line of ISO 15535) is being prepared
    to help different researchers/ national standard bodies in generating internationally
    compatible strength databases. The standard will include data collection design
    and requirements, sampling techniques, sample size, sample composition, and basic
    demographic description of participants. It will also specify database format
    and contents, statistical processing and presentation of data.
