    1.1 This is a practice for using polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) dosimetry systems to measure absorbed dose in materials irradiated by photons or electrons in terms of absorbed dose to water. The PMMA dosimetry system is generally used as a routine dosimetry system.
    1.2 The PMMA dosimeter is classiﬁed as a Type II dosim-eter on the basis of the complex effect of inﬂuence quantities (see ISO/ASTM Practice 52628).
    1.3 This document is one of a set of standards that provides recommendations for properly implementing dosimetry in radiation processing, and describes a means of achieving compliance with the requirements of ISO/ASTM 52628 "Prac-tice for Dosimetry in Radiation Processing" for a PMMA dosimetry system. It is intended to be read in conjunction with ISO/ASTM Practice 52628.
    1.4 This practice covers the use of PMMA dosimetry systems under the following conditions:
    1.4.1 the absorbed dose range is 0.1 kGy to 150 kGy.
    1.4.2 the absorbed dose rate is1×10−2 to1×107 Gy·s−1.
    1.4.3 the photon energy range is 0.1 to 25 MeV.
    1.4.4 the electron energy range is 3 to 25 MeV.
    1.5 This standard does not purport to address all of the safety concerns, if any, associated with its use. It is the responsibility of the user of this standard to establish appro-priate safety, health, and environmental practices and deter-mine the applicability of regulatory limitations prior to use.
    1.6 This international standard was developed in accor-dance with internationally recognized principles on standard-ization established in the Decision on Principles for the Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom-mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.
