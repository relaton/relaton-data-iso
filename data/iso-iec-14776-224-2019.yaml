abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 14776-224:2019(E) defines the Small computer system interface (SCSI)
    Fibre Channel Protocol (FCP). This standard defines how the Fibre Channel services
    and the defined Information Units (IUs) are used to perform the services defined
    by the SCSI Architecture Model - 5 (SAM-5). This fourth version includes additions
    and clarifications to the third version (ISO/IEC 14776-223:2008), removes information
    that is now contained in other standards, and describes additional error recovery
    capabilities for the Fibre Channel Protocol.
