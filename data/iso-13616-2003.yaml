  content: ISO 13616:2003 specifies the elements of an international bank account
    number (IBAN), used to facilitate the processing of data in data interchange internationally
    -- in financial environments as well as within and between other industries. The
    IBAN is designed for automated processing, but can also be conveniently used in
    other media interchange when appropriate (paper document exchange, etc.). ISO
    13616 does not specify internal procedures, file organization techniques, storage
    media, languages, etc. to be used in its implementation. Nor is it designed to
    facilitate the routing of messages within a network. It is applicable to the textual
    data which might be conveyed through a system (network).
