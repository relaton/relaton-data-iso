abstract:
- content: "The purpose of this Standard is to set the criteria for the characteristics
    of products that may be disposed via the toilet and to outline appropriate labelling
    requirements.\n\nThe intent of the proposed Standard is to ensure that material
    discharged down the toilet: \n•\tShould not adversely affect wastewater collection
    and treatment systems.\n•\tShould not adversely impact the environment and discharged
    wastewater treatment plant products. \n•\tIs dispensed from clearly labelled packages
    and containers with clear communication to consumers to avoid the impacts outlined
    above. \n\nThe scope of the proposed new standard is for products designed for,
    marketed for and commonly used in a bathroom setting or for toileting purposes.
    These products would have a significant potential to be disposed via the toilet,
    with the exception of toilet paper, which is currently the remit of ISO TC6 SC2.
    The testing requirements of the standard would apply to products designed or marketed
    as being suitable for toilet flushing. The labelling requirements would apply
    to all products with a significant potential to be disposed via the toilet.\n\nSpecifically,
    the Standard would seek to provide test methods that demonstrate that:\n•\tThe
    product is able to clear the toilet bowl and drain line prior to exiting the boundary
    of a customer property (Drain-line Clearance Test and/or Snag test);\n•\tThe product
    is compatible with the pumps, screens and other mechanical equipment in the sewerage
    network and wastewater treatment system (Pump test – potentially domestic and
    separately a municipal pump test, and/or a disintegration test); \n•\tThe product
    is compatible with flows in small diameter sewers, disintegrating in a manner
    that should avoid blockages within these sewers (Disintegration test);\n•\tAny
    residual product is compatible with settlement in a wastewater treatment process
    (Settling test); and\n•\tThat the material is compatible with the biological systems
    within a typical wastewater treatment plant (Bio-disintegration test) \n•\tThat
    the material does not persist in the environment (Fibre composition test or manufacturer
    attestation).\n\nIn addition, the standard will seek to provide clear labelling,
    consistent with ISO labelling requirements, of products that successfully meet
    the requirements of these test methods. The labelling will seek to increase customer
    awareness of appropriate disposal practices for products used in a toilet setting.
    \n\nExamples of the proposed draft content for the Standard are provided for the
    labelling and drain-line clearance test components only. Given there are four
    different potential input documents that could formulate the final standard and
    there is a need for international agreement on which of these documents is used
    and how they will be incorporated into the final document, the information in
    Annex 2 are only examples of the possible content."
