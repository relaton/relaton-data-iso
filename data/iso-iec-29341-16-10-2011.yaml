abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 29341-16-10:2011(E) describes a service definition which is compliant
    with the UPnP Device Architecture version 1.0.service. This service-type enables
    modelling of \"Basic Power Management Proxy\" function capabilities. Basic Power
    Management Proxy (BPMPX) is a combination of UPnP service and a control point.
    As Control Point, Proxy discovers and controls Low Power Device services running
    in the network, and as UPnP Proxy service, it advertises itself to the network,
    and responds to actions from low power aware Control Point. [LPARCH] Basic functions
    that BPMPX does are as follows:                                                     \n-
    Receive multicast discovery messages from power managed UPnP devices in order
    to be. aware of their power states (i.e. the BPMPX will act as Control Point).
    \                                 \n- Send multicast or unicast discovery messages
    (i.e. M-SEARCH) to query UPnP devices and keep track of their power states (i.e.
    the BPMPX will act as Control Point).                         \n- Send GetPowerManagementInfo
    action to obtain power management mechanism provided by power-aware devices.                \n-
    Should send the appropriate wakeup message to the specified sleeping device when
    it receives WakeupDevice action from power aware Control Point. [LPARCH]. Act
    as UPnP service.           \n- Sending BPMPX service announcements and M-Search
    replies.   \n- Respond to SearchSleepingDevices action to provide the information
    of sleeping devices in network.                               \n- Respond to Wakeup
    action from Control Point. (Wake up action is directed to the low power devices
    and not for waking up the BPMPX)."
