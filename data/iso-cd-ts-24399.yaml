abstract:
- content: This document describes the time of flight diffraction (TOFD) testing of
    polyethylene butt fusion (BF) joints, including pipe-to-pipe, pipe-to-fitting,
    and fitting-to-fitting joints, used for the conveyance of fluids. This document
    provides a test to detect imperfections such as voids, inclusions, lack of fusions,
    misalignment, and particulate contamination in the BF joints. The document only
    applies to polyethylene pipes and fittings without a barrier to ultrasonic waves.
    This document also provides requirements for procedure qualification and guidance
    for personnel qualifications, which are essential for applying this test technique.
    This document also covers the equipment, the preparation and performance of the
    test, the indication assessment, and the reporting for polyethylene BF joints.
    Acceptance criteria are not covered in this document.
