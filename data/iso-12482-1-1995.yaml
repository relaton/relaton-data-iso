  content: Purpose of this part is to ensure that the design constraints of the intended
    use of a crane are clearly identified and to define actions to be taken when the
    crane has been used over a period of time and has approached these constraints,
    to ensure a new safe working period. A description is given of the special assessment
    required to monitor the condition of a crane.
