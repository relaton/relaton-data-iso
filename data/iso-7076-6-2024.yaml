    This document specifies requirements for compressed air foam systems (CAFS) in which foam concentrate and compressed air are continuously added to the water being discharged from the fire-fighting pump. This document is applicable to CAFS that can be permanently installed in fire-fighting vehicles, or that are transportable or mobile.
    This document specifies requirements for CAFS which are used at ambient temperatures ranging from –10 °C to +40 °C.
    This document does not apply to stationary CAFS.
    This document does not apply to requirements for hazards related to handling foam concentrates, noise generated by CAFS, drives, auxiliary equipment, power sources, or pumps connected to the CAFS.
    This document does not specify requirements for special hazards arising from particular conditions under which CAFS are used, for example:
    —     immunity against electromagnetic fields and electrostatic discharge;
    —     operation without supervision;
    —     events specific to the location where the CAFS is set up (e.g. on public roads);
    —     handling of any equipment, devices, etc. which have to be connected to the CAFS or are joined to it (e.g. branch pipes, nozzles and pressure hoses);
    —     decommissioning and disposal.
