abstract:
- content: |-
    This document specifies the minimum safety requirements applicable to liquefied natural gas (LNG) on-board fuel system intended for use on the types of motor vehicles defined in ISO 3833.
    This document is applicable to vehicles (mono-fuel, bi-fuel or dual-fuel applications) using liquefied natural gas in accordance with the ISO 15403 series. It is not applicable to original-production and converted vehicles.
    All matters relating to the skills of installers and converters have been excluded from this document.
    This document is only applicable on the components in the "LNG system" meaning an assembly of components (tanks, valves, flexible fuel lines, etc., see Annex B) and connecting parts (fuel lines, fittings, etc.) fitted on motor vehicles using LNG in their propulsion system and related components up to and including the vaporizer. Other parts downstream from the vaporizer are considered as CNG components covered by ISO 15501.
