    ISO 29464:2011 establishes a terminology for the air filtration industry and comprises terms and definitions together with, in some cases, symbols and units.
    ISO 29464:2011 is applicable to both particulate and gas phase air filters and cleaners used for the general ventilation of inhabited enclosed spaces. Air inlet filters for static or seaborne rotary machines are included.
    ISO 29464:2011 does not apply to cabin filters for road vehicles or air inlet filters for mobile internal combustion engines, for which separate arrangements exist. Dust separators for the purpose of air pollution control are also excluded.
