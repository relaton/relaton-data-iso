    ISO 22902-4:2006 provides a communication model that contains the requirements for a Vehicle Interface Protocol (VIP) to access a vehicle interface over a network transport protocol for AMI-C networks. It does not apply to networks that have pre-existing protocols and messages for transporting vehicle functions.
    A VIP defines how an application communicates over a simple network transport mechanism. These requirements can be applied to network technologies that use UDP/IP as the transport method. However, pre-existing systems may have unique protocols and messages for transporting messages about vehicle functions; therefore, ISO 22902-4:2006 does not cover such pre-existing technology.
    Messages transported are network-specific instantiations of the CMS.
    ISO 22902-4:2006 addresses the following aspects related to the AMI-C's approach to network communication:
    - Message frame format,
    - Application transaction,
    - System transaction,
    - Initialization process,
    - Address resolution, and
    - Functional module discovery and removal process.
