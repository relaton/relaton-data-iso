abstract:
- content: Applicable only to clear, slightly coloured liqids. Such colour characteristics
    are described as brownish-yellow. The principle is based on a visual comparison
    of the colour of a sample with that of colour standards. The results are expressed
    in terms of the platinum-cobalt scale. For routine control purposes a comparator,
    colorimeter or spectrophotometer may be used, if the values so obtained are identical
    with those obtained by visual comparison.
