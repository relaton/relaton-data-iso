  content: "ISO/IEC 25012:2008 defines a general data quality model for data retained
    in a structured format within a computer system.\nISO/IEC 25012:2008 can be used
    to establish data quality requirements, define data quality measures, or plan
    and perform data quality evaluations. It could be used, for example, \n- to define
    and evaluate data quality requirements in data production, acquisition and integration
    processes,\n- to identify data quality assurance criteria, also useful for re-engineering,
    assessment and improvement of data,\n- to evaluate the compliance of data with
    legislation and/or requirements.\nISO/IEC 25012:2008 categorizes quality attributes
    into fifteen characteristics considered by two points of view: inherent and system
    dependent. Data quality characteristics will be of varying importance and priority
    to different stakeholders.\nISO/IEC 25012:2008 is intended to be used in conjunction
    with the other parts of the SQuaRE series of International Standards, and with
    ISO/IEC 9126-1 until superseded by ISO/IEC 25010."
