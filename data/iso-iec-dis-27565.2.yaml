    This document provides guidelines on using zero knowledge proofs (ZKP) to improve privacy
    by reducing the risks associated with the sharing or transmission of personal data between
    organisations and users by minimizing the information shared. It will include several ZKP
    functional requirements relevant to a range of different business use cases, then describes
    how different ZKP models can be used to meet those functional requirements securely.
