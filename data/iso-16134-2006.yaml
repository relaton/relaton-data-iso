  script: Latn
  content: ISO 16134:2006 specifies the design of earthquake- and subsidence-resistant
    ductile iron pipelines suitable for use in areas where seismic activity and land
    subsidence can be expected. It provides a means of determining and checking the
    resistance of buried pipelines and also gives example calculations. It is applicable
    to ductile iron pipes and fittings with joints that have expansion/contraction
    and deflection capabilities, used in pipelines buried underground.
