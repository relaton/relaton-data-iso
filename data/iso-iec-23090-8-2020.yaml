abstract:
- content: The network-based media processing (NBMP) framework defines the interfaces
    including both data formats and application programming interfaces (APIs) among
    the entities connected through digital networks for media processing. Users can
    access and configure their operations remotely for efficient, intelligent processing.
    This document describes and manages workflows to be applied to the media data.
    This process includes uploading of media data to the network, instantiation of
    the media processing tasks, and configuration of the tasks. The framework enables
    dynamic creation of media processing pipelines, as well as access to processed
    media data and metadata in real-time or in a deferred way. The media and metadata
    formats used between the media source, workflow manager and media processing entities
    in a media processing pipeline are also specified.
