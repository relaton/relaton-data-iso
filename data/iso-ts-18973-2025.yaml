abstract:
- content: This document describes a test procedure for the determination of resistance
    to repeated loading by – amongst others – applying out-of-phase load cycles which
    generate forces in two directions, representative of those caused by traffic on
    railway track, taking into account the effect of two consecutive axles of passing
    railway vehicles.
