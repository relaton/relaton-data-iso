- content: |-
    ISO 7404-1:2016 defines terms that are used in connection with both maceral and microlithotype analyses, and with the determination of the reflectance of vitrinite. It applies to the terms used in the examination of coal of all ranks.
    ISO 7404-1:2016 is not intended to be a comprehensive glossary of coal petrographic terminology, nor does it attempt to provide sufficient information to allow recognition of all the coal components described. Further information may be obtained from the relevant ICCP publications[3][4][5].
