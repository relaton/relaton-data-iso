  content: This document defines the procedure executed by a Member of a distributed
    inter-process communication (IPC) facility (DIF) or distributed application facility
    (DAF) to initialize a new Member as a fully functioning Member. This document
    defines the procedure for a new Member to enrol when the new Member was recently
    a Member of the DIF or DAF. This document is defined for use with DIFs, but it
    can be used equally well by a DAF that wants to assign synonyms with a scope limited
    to the DAF.
