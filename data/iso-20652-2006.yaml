  content: ISO 20652:2006 identifies, defines and provides structure to the relationships
    and interactions between an information producer and an archive. It defines the
    methodology for the structure of actions that are required from the initial time
    of contact between the producer and the archive until the objects of information
    are received and validated by the archive. These actions cover the first stage
    of the ingest process as defined in the open archival information system (OAIS)
    reference model (see ISO 14721). ISO 20652:2006 describes parts of the functional
    entities administration ('negotiate submission agreement') and ingest ('receive
    submission' and 'quality assurance').
