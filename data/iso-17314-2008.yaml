    ISO 17314:2008 specifies a method for calculating the recyclability rate and the recoverability rate of manually portable forest machinery, with each rate being expressed as a percentage by mass (mass fraction in percent) of the machine.
    The calculation can be performed by the machine manufacturer when a machine is initially put on the market. It does not include fluids.
