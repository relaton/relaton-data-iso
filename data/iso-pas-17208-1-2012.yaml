abstract:
- content: "ISO/PAS 17208-1:2012 describes the general measurement systems, procedures
    and methodologies to be used to measure underwater sound pressure levels from
    ships at a prescribed operating condition. It presents a methodology for the reporting
    of one-third-octave band sound pressure levels. The resulting quantities are the
    sound pressure levels normalized to a distance of 1 m. The underwater sound pressure
    level measurements are performed in the geometric far field and then adjusted
    to the 1 m normalized distance for use in comparison with appropriate underwater
    noise criteria. \nISO/PAS 17208-1:2012 does not specify or provide guidance on
    underwater noise criteria or address the potential effects of noise on marine
    organisms.\nIt is applicable to any and all underway surface vessels, either manned
    or unmanned. Its methods have no inherent limitation on minimum or maximum vessel
    size. It is not applicable to submerged vessels or to aircraft, and is limited
    to vessels transiting at speeds no greater than 50 knots (25,70 m/s). The measurement
    methods mitigate the variability caused by Lloyd's mirror surface image coherence
    effects, but do not exclude a possible influence of propagation effects such as
    bottom reflections, refraction and absorption. No specific computational adjustments
    for these effects are given. A specific ocean location is not required for the
    application of ISO/PAS 17208-1:2012, but requirements for an ocean test site are
    provided. \nAmong the applications of ISO/PAS 17208-1:2012 are the showing of
    compliance with contract requirements, the enabling of periodic signature assessments
    and in research and development. Intended users include government agencies, research
    vessel operators and commercial vessel owners operating in acoustically sensitive
    waters."
