    This document specifies a quality discrimination method for optical disks and the operating method of storage systems for long-term digital data preservation using optical disks and optical disk drives (hereinafter referred to as "drives").
    It is applicable to recordable (write-once) optical disks which can prevent physical overwriting and deletion by erroneous or intentional operation in contexts where greater importance is given to evidence. It is also applicable to read-only (ROM) optical disks.
    This document specifies:
    —     combinations of recordable optical disks and drives used for long-term data preservation;
    —     quality discrimination criteria for recordable optical disks and the operation method of long-term storage systems;
    —     a quality test for read-only optical disks and the operation method of long-term storage systems;
    —     quality discrimination criteria for BD recordable disks when adopting defect management.
