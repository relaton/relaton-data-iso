- content: |-
    This document defines and establishes a framework for access management (AM) and the secure management of the process to access information and information and communications technologies (ICT) resources, associated with the accountability of a subject within some contexts.
    This document provides concepts, terms and definitions applicable to distributed access management techniques in network environments.
    This document also provides explanations about related architecture, components and management functions.
    The subjects involved in access management can be uniquely recognized to access information systems, as defined in the ISO/IEC 24760 series.
    The nature and qualities of physical access control involved in access management systems are outside the scope of this document.
