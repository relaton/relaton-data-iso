- content: |-
    ISO/IEC 23005-6:2013 specifies syntax and semantics of the data types and tools common to the tools defined in the other parts of ISO/IEC 23005, such as basic data types which are used as basic building blocks in more than one of the tools in ISO/IEC 23005, colour-related basic types which are used in light and colour‑related tools to help in specifying colour-related characteristics of the devices or commands, and time stamp types which can be used in device commands, and sensed information to specify timing related information.
    Several classification schemes which are used in more than one part of ISO/IEC 23005 are also defined in Annex A of ISO/IEC 23005-6:2013. Other tools to be developed are included in ISO/IEC 23005-6:2013, if those tools are to be used with the tools defined in more than one part of ISO/IEC 23005. Most of the tools defined in ISO/IEC 23005-6:2013 are not intended to be used alone, but to be used as a part or as a supporting tool of other tools defined in other parts of ISO/IEC 23005.
