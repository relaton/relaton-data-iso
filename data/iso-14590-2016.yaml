abstract:
- content: |-
    ISO 14590:2016 applies to cold-reduced steel sheet of two types that are commercially available in the world. Type 1 represents steels that are produced to mechanical properties only and Type 2 represents steels that are produced to both chemical and mechanical properties. Bake hardening steels are included in both types.
    It does not cover steels designated as commercial quality or drawing qualities (covered in ISO 3574), steels of structural quality (covered in ISO 4997) or steels of higher strength with improved formability (covered in ISO 13887).
