abstract:
- content: 'ISO/TR 13097:2013 addresses the stability characterization of liquid dispersions
    (suspensions, emulsions, foams and mixtures thereof) for applications, such as
    new product design, optimization of existing products, quality control during
    processing and during usage of the product. The stability of a dispersion in the
    sense of ISO/TR 13097:2013 is defined in terms of the change in one or more physical
    properties over a given time period. '
