    This document specifies dimensional characteristics, contact allocation, tests and requirements of 7-pole connectors for electrical connections of electronically monitored charging systems of towing and towed vehicles. The electronic monitoring system is designed to detect 12 V and 24 V nominal supply voltage and to limit the current to 50 A, and this is a connector without any braking capacity.
    This electrical connection is intended for use with separable truck-trailer combinations in order to connect an additional battery pack of the trailer with the generator of the truck using an electronically monitored charging system. Additional battery packs in trailers are basically used with tailgate lifts, electrical forklifts or other technical equipment with high current consumption.
    This document further specifies a park socket used to receive and store the plug when it is disconnected.
