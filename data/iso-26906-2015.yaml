    ISO 29606:2015 specifies requirements for the integration of fishpasses with flow measurement structures. It identifies those fishpasses which have satisfactory hydrometric calibration data and gives methods for computing combined flows and uncertainties.
    NOTE          Flow measurement structures and fishpasses have inherently different hydraulic performance criteria. Flow measurement structures perform better with uniform flow patterns; conversely, fish passage performance is improved by the variability of the flow conditions that allow fish and other aquatic inhabitants to select the passage conditions that best meet their mode of movement. This International Standard does not suggest that the fishpasses discussed are the preferred methods of fish passage or that they are good enough that passage performance can be sacrificed to obtain a single structure that meets both the fish passage and flow measurement requirements.
