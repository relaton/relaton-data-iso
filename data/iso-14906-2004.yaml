abstract:
- content: "ISO 14906:2004 specifies the application interface in the context of Electronic
    Fee Collection (EFC) systems using the Dedicated Short-Range communication (DSRC).
    The EFC application interface is the EFC application process interface to the
    DSRC Application Layer. \nISO 14906:2004 is applicable to the EFC attributes (i.e.
    EFC application information); the addressing procedures of EFC attributes and
    (hardware) components (e.g. ICC and MMI); EFC application functions, i.e. further
    qualification of actions by definitions of the concerned services, assignment
    of associated ActionType values and content and meaning of action parameters;
    the EFC transaction model, which defines the common elements and steps of any
    EFC transaction; the behaviour of the interface so as to ensure interoperability
    on an EFC-DSRC application interface level.\nThis is an interface standard, adhering
    to the open systems interconnection (OSI) philosophy (ISO/IEC 7498-1), and it
    is, as such, not concerned with the implementation choices to be realised at either
    side of the interface.\nISO 14906:2004 provides security-specific functionality
    as place holders (data and functions) to enable the implementation of secure EFC
    transactions. Yet the specification of the security policy (including specific
    security algorithms and key management) remains at the discretion and under the
    control of the EFC operator, and hence is outside the scope of ISO 14906:2004."
