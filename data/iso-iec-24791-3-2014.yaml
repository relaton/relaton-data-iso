  content: "ISO/IEC 24791-3:2014 defines interfaces for device management of radio
    frequency identification (RFID) systems. Interfaces are defined that provide for
    discovery, configuration, initialization and monitoring of RFID systems within
    the Software System Infrastructure (SSI).\nIt only deals with devices that provide
    RFID related services. It does not distinguish the form factor of such RFID devices.\nISO/IEC
    24791-3:2014 provides two distinct interface sets, one based on the EPCglobal
    Discovery, Configuration, and Initialization (DCI) standard and the IETF SNMP
    RFCs and the other based on the Organization for the Advancement of Structured
    Information Standards (OASIS) Device Profile for Web Services (DPWS) standard.
    The definition of the Device Profile for RFID is referred to in ISO/IEC 24791-3:2014
    as the RFID Device Management Profile, or RDMP. \nEach interface option set provides
    interface definitions that provide ISO/IEC 24791-3 Client Endpoints and Services
    Endpoints with the mechanisms for:\n- discovery of the RFID devices and services
    on a local or remote subnet;\n- a firmware upgrade service;\n- a management service
    that implements configuration related functions;\n- a monitoring service for reporting
    alerts, diagnostics, and performance information.\nThe two interface set definitions
    provided by ISO/IEC 24791-3:2014 allow for clients and services endpoints to implement
    and provide the services based on the specific characteristics of the RFID system
    to be implemented."
