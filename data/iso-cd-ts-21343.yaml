    This document stipulates guidelines for manufacturers of ammonia-fired boilers regarding tests performed from the time of design to acceptance, in order to meet the required environmental performance.
    Functional test at test facilities and on-site acceptance tests are required to be carried out for a fuel ammonia-fired boiler. The attached document stipulates the test methods, the measurement items, the evaluation methods, and the test reports for each test.
    NOx, NH3, and N2O are measured at the combustion chamber outlet during the functional test and at the boiler outlet during the acceptance test, respectively.
    The scope of the attached document is such equipment that satisfies all of the following.
    a) Land boilers used for power generation with a power output of 100 MW or more;
    b) Use ammonia as fuel;
    c) Boiler with burners for combustion of main fuel.
    The attached document does not apply to heat recovery steam generators for gas turbines equipped with ammonia duct burners.
