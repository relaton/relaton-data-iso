    This International Standard specifies a spectrophotometric method for the determination of hydroquinone in
    photographic processing waste.
    This method can be applied to samples containing hydroquinone in the concentration range of 200 μg/l to
    4 000 μg/l; aminophenols and phenylenediamines should also be determined by this method. However, sulfonated
    hydroquinones or products from the further oxidation of benzoquinone will not be determined.
