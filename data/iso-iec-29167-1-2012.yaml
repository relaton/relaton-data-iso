abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 29167-1:2012 defines the architecture for security and file management
    for the ISO/IEC 18000 air interface standards for radio frequency identification
    (RFID) devices. It provides a common technical specification for security and
    file management for RFID devices that can be used by ISO committees developing
    RFID application standards. \nISO/IEC 29167-1:2012 specifies architecture for\n-
    \       untraceability,\n-        security services, and\n-        file management\nas
    a further optional extension of the air interface. Both security and file management
    are defined in alignment with existing air interfaces and ISO/IEC 29167-1:2012
    only covers extensions on security and file management beyond the scope of the
    ISO/IEC 18000 air interfaces.\nISO/IEC 29167-1:2012 defines various security features
    called security mechanisms that can be implemented by a tag depending on the application.
    A tag can support one, a subset, or all of the specified security mechanisms.
    For an interrogator it is possible to get information about the security mechanisms
    that are actually implemented and supported by a tag. Moreover, it has been considered
    that adding new security mechanisms remains possible. Besides signaling the presence
    of certain security services, further details of the mechanisms such as utilized
    encryption algorithm and key length also need to be specified and accessible."
