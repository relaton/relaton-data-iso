    This document provides a method for estimating minimum legible font size for single characters, but not for words or sentences, in self-luminous or reflected mode, used in documents, products labels, signs, and displays for people at any age and in any viewing condition in which viewing distance, luminance and contrast are varied.
    This document applies designing and evaluating legibility of single characters for people at any age who have no pathological disorders in their eyes, but not for people with visual impairments such as low vision. The application is specifically directed to, but not limited to, the cases of printed materials where fixed font size is used.
    Applicability of the method to other languages is given in Annex F.
