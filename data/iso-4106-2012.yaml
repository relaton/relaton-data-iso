abstract:
- content: This International Standard specifies methods for evaluating the performance
    of engines designed for motorcycles as defined in ISO 3833, in particular with
    a view to the presentation of power curves and specific fuel consumption at full
    load as a function of engine speed, for net power assessment. It is applicable
    to reciprocating internal combustion engines (spark-ignition or compression-ignition)
    — excluding free-piston engines — and rotary piston engines, either naturally
    aspirated or pressure-charged and equipped with either mechanical pressure-charger
    or turbocharger. Particular specifications for the test of compression-ignition
    engines are specified in Annex A.
