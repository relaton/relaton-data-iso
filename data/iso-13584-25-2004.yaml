  content: "ISO 13584-25:2004 provides generic EXPRESS resource constructs that support
    the description of aggregate data types and values occurring in supplier libraries.
    It also contains an integrated EXPRESS information model for representing supplier
    libraries for the purpose of exchange. This integrated information model integrates
    the above resource constructs with other EXPRESS resource constructs from different
    parts of ISO 13584 and ISO 10303 into one single schema. Supplier libraries may
    consist of definitions and of representations of families of parts. They may also
    define new representation categories. Supplier libraries may consist only of dictionary
    elements with or without aggregate data types, or they may also contain explicit
    specifications of the sets of permitted instances.\nWhen used together with view
    exchange protocols, this integrated information model also permits the exchange
    of one or several representation categories for the parts defined in a parts library.\nThe
    following are within the scope of ISO 13584-25:2004:\n- generic resource constructs
    for representing aggregate data types. Aggregate data types and values are modelled
    according to the definition of aggregate data types of the EXPRESS language (ISO
    10303-11);\n- generic resource constructs for representing aggregate values;\n-
    generic resource constructs for representing assembled parts that may contain
    an unlimited number of constituent components;\n- a library integrated information
    model that provides for modelling and exchanging supplier libraries that contain
    properties whose values may be aggregate-structured, and whose possible class
    extensions are explicitly described as sets of instances.\nThe following are outside
    the scope of this part of ISO 13584-25:2004:\n- representation of expressions
    and variables;\n- implicit description of the set of permitted instances of a
    class by means of constraints; \n- specification of a software system able to
    manage supplier libraries represented according to the information models defined
    in ISO 13584-25:2004."
