    This document defines a process assessment model for safety processes, conformant with the requirements of ISO/IEC33004, for use in performing a conformant assessment in accordance with the requirements of ISO/IEC33002.
    This document supports the use of the process assessment models for system and software life cycle processes (ISO/IEC 33060 and ISO/IEC 33061) when applied to assessment of processes in the development of (functional or non-functional) safety related systems in order to make consistent judgment regarding process quality and/or improvement priorities.
