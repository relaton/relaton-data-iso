    This document specifies a mild oxidation method to determine the content of carbon impurities (carbon material content not in the form of CNT, including amorphous carbon and trace amountd of other types of structured carbon) less stable than multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) under carbon dioxide atmosphere.
    This document is applicable to the characterization of carbon impurities content in MWCNT samples prepared by chemical vapour deposition (CVD). Measurement of carbon impurities in MWCNT samples prepared by other methods can refer to this document. This method is not applicable to functionalized MWCNT samples or MWCNT samples with encapsulant species.
    NOTE       This method is applicable for the case of TG curves with a single-stage.
