    This document gives guidelines for selecting the most appropriate file format(s) for the storage, usability, and exchange of data with a long-term management objective.
    It is applicable to the selection of file formats to be used to store electronic documents. It provides guidance that takes into account:
    —          the durability of documents in a readable form;
    —          fidelity to the original and data integrity;
    —          interoperability, i.e. independence from creation applications, information systems and rendition platforms;
    —          compliance with relevant laws and regulations;
    —          compliance with format specifications;
    —          reducing costs by reducing the number of conversions/migrations over time.
    This document is applicable to all office activities (e.g. text processing, spreadsheets, presentations), email and static web pages, as well as all types of electronic components, including images, video and sound.
    It does not apply to database formats.
