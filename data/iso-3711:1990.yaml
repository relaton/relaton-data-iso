  content: Specifies the requirements and the corresponding test methods for the pigments.
    They are classified in a table which gives the Colour Index Number and the approximate
    composition of the pigments. The pigments are divided into the standard type and
    the stabilized type. total lead content, a gravimetric and a titrimetric method
    are specified. The gravimetric method shall be used as the referee method. The
    extraction method for the determination of soluble-lead content described has
    been derived from ISO 6713:1984. Cancels and replaces ISO 3711:1976, of which
    it constitutes a technical revision.
