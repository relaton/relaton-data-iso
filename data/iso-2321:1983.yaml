abstract:
- content: Specifies methods of test for determining certain physical and mechanical
    properties. Owing to the comparatively small cross-section and unusual conditions
    of performance of this material, special methods have been developed. Some of
    the tests may not be entirely suitable for thread made from certain synthetic
    rubbers. Comparisons may only be made on new rubber threads or on that with identical
    processing histories. The previous history shall be stated in the test report.
