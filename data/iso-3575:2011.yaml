  content: "ISO 3575:2011 applies to carbon steel sheet of commercial and drawing
    qualities coated by the continuous hot‑dip zinc‑coating process.\nZinc‑coated
    sheet is suitable for applications where resistance to corrosion is of prime importance.\nThe
    steel sheet is produced in a number of qualities, coating mass, surface treatments
    and ordering conditions.\nZinc- and zinc‑iron-alloy-coated steel sheet can be
    ordered in one of two ordering conditions.\nISO 3575:2011 does not cover steels
    designated as structural quality, which are covered in ISO 4998. "
