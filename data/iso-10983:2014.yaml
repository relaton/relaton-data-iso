    ISO 10983:2014 specifies minimum requirements for the manufacture and testing of bonded finger joints in structural wood products such as glued laminated timber, cross-laminated timber, and finger-jointed timber.
    Although most finger joints are produced in coniferous species (softwoods), ISO 10983:2014 also applies to broadleafed species (hardwoods) where information is available to enable them to be satisfactorily bonded.
    It does not cover impressed (die-formed) joints and, in the case of laminated timber products, it applies only to individual laminations. Large finger joints in glued laminated timber are not covered by ISO 10983:2014.
