    ISO 20507:2003 provides a list of terms and associated definitions which are typically used for fine ceramic (advanced ceramic, advanced technical ceramic) materials, products, applications, properties and processes. ISO 20507:2003 contains, in separate lists, those abbreviations which have found general acceptance in scientific and technical literature; they are given together with the corresponding terms and definitions or descriptions.
    In ISO 20507:2003, the terms are defined using the words "fine ceramic". The definitions apply equally to "advanced ceramics" and "advanced technical ceramics", which are considered to be equivalent.
    ISO 20507:2003 does not include terms which, though used in the field of fine ceramics, are of a more general nature and are also well known in other fields of technology.
