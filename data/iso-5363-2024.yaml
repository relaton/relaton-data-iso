    This document specifies test methods for the exoskeleton-type walking RACA robot used as medical electrical equipment which is intended to move from one location to another, by making reciprocating motion having intermittent contact with the travel surface.
    This document does not apply to passive or non-powered exoskeletons.
    NOTE            These tests can be used to verify conformity with the requirements of IEC 80601-2-78.
