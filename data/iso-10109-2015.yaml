  content: ISO 10109:2015 contains tables for environmental tests and test parameters
    which can be used as a guideline for the selection of environmental tests. These
    include the selection of standardized tests according to ISO 9022 as well as additional
    parameters not described in ISO 9022 and necessary for the optical or photonic
    instruments. Ultimately, these tables specify the requirements to be met with
    regard to the reliability of the optical, mechanical, chemical, and electrical
    properties or performance characteristics of the instruments when exposed to environmental
    influences.
