  content: ISO 11707:2011 specifies wet analytical methods for lead and cadmium. There
    are two methods for the simultaneous determination of lead and cadmium in magnesium
    and its alloys. Method A uses a matrix-matching technique for unalloyed magnesium
    and its alloys by inductively coupled plasma/atomic emission spectrometry (ICP/AES)
    or flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS), Method B uses an extraction method
    for magnesium alloys with pretreatment procedures. Generally, Method A is recommended;
    also, Method B is designated where the matrix-matching method cannot be adopted
    due to complicated preparation of the assay standard solutions or where the combination
    of solvent extraction and FAAS is useful for analysts.
