    This document specifies the integrated generic resource constructs for geometric and topological representation.  The following are within the scope of this document:
    The following are in the scope of the geometry schema:
    - definition of points, vectors, parametric curves and parametric surfaces;
    - definition of finite volumes with internal parametrisation;
    - definition of transformation operators;
    - points defined directly by their coordinate values or in terms of the parameters of an existing curve or surface;
    - definition of conic curves and elementary surfaces;
    - definition of curves defined on a parametric surface;
    - definition of general parametric spline curves, surfaces and volumes;
    - definition of locally refined spline curves, surfaces and volumes;
    - definition of point, curve and surface replicas;
    - definition of offset curves and surfaces;
    - definition of intersection curves.
    The following are in the scope of the topology schema:
    - definition of the fundamental topological entities vertex, edge, and face, each with a specialised subtype to enable it to be associated with the geometry of a point, curve, or surface, respectively;
    - collections of the basic entities to form topological structures of path, loop and shell and constraints to ensure the integrity of these structures;
    - the association of faces with geometric volumes;
    - orientation of topological entities.
    The following are in the scope of the geometric model schema:
    - data describing the precise geometric form of three-dimensional solid
    - objects;
    - constructive solid geometry (CSG) models;
    - CSG models in two-dimensional space;
    - definition of CSG primitives and half-spaces;
    - creation of solid models by sweeping operations;
    - manifold boundary representation (B-rep) models;
    - constraints to ensure the integrity of B-rep models;
    - surface models;
    - wireframe models;
    - geometric sets;
    - creation of a replica of a solid model in a new location;
    - tessellated geometry;
    - the association of tessellated geometry with exact geometry.
    The following are in the scope of the scan data 3d shape model schema:
    - representation of a shape as a cloud of points produced by a scanning process.
    The following are outside the scope of this document:
    - all other forms of procedurally defined curves and surfaces;
    - curves and surfaces which do not have a parametric form of representation;
    - any form of explicit representation of a ruled surface.
    NOTE    For a ruled surface the geometry is critically dependent upon the parametrisation of the boundary curves and the method of associating pairs of points on the two curves. A ruled surface with B-spline boundary curves can however be exactly represented by the B-spline surface entity.

    - spatial occupancy forms of solid models (such as octree models);
    - geometric tolerances;
    - implicit forms of representation in terms of features;
    - assemblies and mechanisms.
