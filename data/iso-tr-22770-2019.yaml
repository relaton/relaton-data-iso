    This document provides guidance on the usage of analytical colorimetry to support visual assessment of surface preparation grades described in ISO 8501-1:2007, Clause 4.
    This document provides examples of applications where the use of a colorimeter or spectrophotometer can enable a quick and objective assessment of the preparation grade of the substrate.
    NOTE   The data given in this document was obtained using the methodology described in Annex A.
