  content: 'Specifies a method for determining fibre coarseness (which is a fibre
    property characterizing pulp): distribution of a known mass of fibres evenly over
    a known area, counting the number of fibre crossings along a line of known length
    on a microscope slide. The weight factor can be calculated from the fibre coarseness.
    The method is applicable to pulps with relatively intact fibres, such as chemical
    and semichemical pulps. Does not apply to mechanical and semimechanical pulps
    or highly beaten chemical or semichemical pulps.'
