    ISO 21210:2012 specifies networking protocol functionalities related to IPv6 networking between two or more ITS stations communicating over the global Internet communication network.
    ISO 21210:2012 assumes that the reader is familiar with IETF specifications found in "Request for Comments" (RFCs) of individual IPv6 protocol blocks used within ISO 21210:2012. It does not define a new protocol, a new exchange of messages at the IPv6 layer, or  new data structures. It defines how standard IETF protocols are combined so that ITS stations can communicate with one another using the IPv6 family of protocols. Procedures defined to share information between the IPv6 layer and other components of the ITS station architecture are defined in ISO 24102.
