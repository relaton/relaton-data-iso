    ISO 23552-1:2007 specifies safety, construction and performance requirements for electronic fuel/air ratio control systems intended for use with gas or oil burners and gas or oil burning appliances. ISO 23552-1:2007 also describes the test procedures for evaluating these requirements and specifies information necessary for installation and use.
    ISO 23552-1:2007 is applicable only to closed-loop fuel/air ratio controls and does not differentiate into classes by heat input.
    ISO 23552-1:2007 applies to electronic fuel/air ratio control systems that can be tested independently or as part of an appliance or as part of a burner.
