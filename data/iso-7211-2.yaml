  content: 'Three methods of determining the number of threads per centimetre are
    included, any of which may be used, the choice depending on the character of the
    fabric. The principles are as follows: Method A: A section of fabric of dimension
    specified is dissected and the number of threads counted. The treads that are
    to be counted are preferably short, 1 or 2 cm being suitable. Method B: the number
    of threads visible within the aperture of a defined counting glass is determined.
    Method C: the number of threads per centimetre of the fabric is determined with
    the aid of a traversing thread counter.'
