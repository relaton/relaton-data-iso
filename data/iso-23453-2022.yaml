    This document provides general guidelines for design and manufacture of a hub vortex energy-saving device for a fixed-pitch marine propeller. This document can also apply to the design and manufacture of hub vortex energy-saving device for other types of marine propellers.
    According to the specific geometrical shape of the propeller and other specifications, it is suggested that hub cap with fins is used in merchant ships.
