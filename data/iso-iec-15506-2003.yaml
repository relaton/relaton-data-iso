    ISO/IEC 15506:2003 specifies the signalling protocol for the support of the Message Waiting Indication supplementary service (SS-MWI) at the Q reference point between Private Integrated services Network eXchanges (PINXs) connected together within a Private Integrated Services Network (PISN).
    The supplementary service MWI enables a Served User to be sent a Message Waiting Indication and also enables this Message Waiting Indication to be cancelled. The Served User may also be permitted to interrogate the Message Centre for any Message Waiting Indication.
    The Q reference point is defined in ISO/IEC 11579-1.
    Service specifications are produced in three stages and according to the method specified in ETS 300 387. This International Standard contains the stage 3 specification for the Q reference point and satisfies the requirements identified by the stage 1 and stage 2 specifications in ISO/IEC 15505.
    The signalling protocol for SS-MWI uses certain aspects of the generic procedures for the control of supplementary services specified in ISO/IEC 11582.
    ISO/IEC 15506:2003 also specifies additional signalling protocol requirements for the support of interactions at the Q reference point between SS-MWI and other supplementary services and ANFs.
    NOTE Additional interactions that have no impact on the signalling protocol at the Q reference point can be found in the relevant stage 1 specifications.
    ISO/IEC 15506:2003 is applicable to PINXs which can interconnect to form a PISN.
