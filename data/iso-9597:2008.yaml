- content: |-
    ISO 9597:2008 specifies the methods for determining standard consistence, setting times and soundness of cements.
    ISO 9597:2008 applies to common cements and to other cements and materials, the standards for which call up this method. It might not apply to other cement types that have, for example, a very short initial setting time. The method is used for assessing whether the setting time and soundness of a cement is in conformity with its specification.
    ISO 9597:2008 describes the reference methods and allows the use of alternative procedures and equipment, as indicated, provided that they have been calibrated against the reference methods. In the event of a dispute, only the reference equipment and procedures described in ISO 9597:2008 can be used, excluding any alternatives.
