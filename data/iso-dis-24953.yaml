abstract:
- content: This document provides basic regulations for adsorption efficiency testing
    methods using radioactive methyl iodine in activated carbon fibres used to adsorb
    and remove radioactive isotopes (I131) contained in air or gas flow (exhaust).
    This test method is used to evaluate the adsorption efficiency of radioactive
    isotopes leaked from nuclear facilities, hospitals, and companies handling radioactive
    substances, etc.
