    This part of ISO/IEC 16500 covers the high and mid layer protocols for DAVIC systems. It defines a set of
    protocol components ("tools") which are referenced by ISO/IEC 16500-2 ("System Dynamics, Scenarios, and
    Protocol Requirements").
    In particular this part of ISO/IEC 16500 describes the protocol stacks required for the support of the DAVIC
    flows, i.e., S1 through S5. The specific DAVIC options for each of the protocols are specified as well as the
    different optional protocols stacks applicable. Requirements on protocols at specific interfaces are also considered
    and included in the specification.
