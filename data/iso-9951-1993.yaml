  content: Specifies dimensions, ranges, construction, performance, calibration and
    output characteristics of the turbine meters. Also deals with installation conditions,
    leakage testing und pressure testing and provides a series of informative annexes
    A to E including recommendations for use, field checks, and perturbations of the
    fluid flowing. In many countries, some or all of the items covered are subject
    to mandatory regulations imposed by the laws of these countries. Where conflicts
    exist, the mandatory regulations shall prevail.
