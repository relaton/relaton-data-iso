  content: "This document provides recommended guidelines for the evaluation of colour
    reproduction capability in the printing of packaging materials. It provides a
    basis for the development of colour certification schemes by individual brand
    owners and/or industry associations and for the evaluation of printed results
    against those schemes. \nBecause the package printing supply chain involves multiple
    partners, both the potential impact of each partner on the overall colour control
    and the individual responsibilities of each partner are identified in this document.
    The unique requirements of the individual reproduction processes and their impact
    on colour reproduction are also identified."
