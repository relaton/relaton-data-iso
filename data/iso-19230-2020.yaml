abstract:
- content: |-
    This document specifies the general provisions and gives the basic definitions of terms relating to sampling for gas analysis, including sampling devices, sampling methods, sampling technical considerations, and sampling safety.
    This document applies to both direct and indirect sampling of gas in pressure receptacles and pipelines, including pure gases and gas mixtures. Compressed and liquefied gases are both considered.
    This document applies to the sampling of processed gases and does not involve gas treatment processes.
    The sampling procedures specified are not intended for the sampling of special products which are the subject of other International Standards, such as liquefied petroleum gases (see ISO 4257) and gaseous natural gases (see ISO 10715).
