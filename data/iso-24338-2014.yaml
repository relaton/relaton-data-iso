    ISO 24338:2014 specifies two methods (A and B) for measuring abrasion of laminate floor covering elements. The tests described measure the ability of the surface layer to resist abrasive wear-through.
    Abrasion, according to method A, is achieved by rotating a test specimen in contact with a pair of loaded cylindrical wheels covered with specified abrasive paper. The resistance to wear, according to method B, is evaluated by abrading the face of test pieces with a specified abrasive applied by means of two loaded wheels. The number of revolutions of the test specimen required to cause a defined degree of abrasion is measured by both methods.
    NOTE          The precision of the methods is not known. When inter-laboratory data become available, a precision statement will be added.
