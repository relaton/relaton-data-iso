  content: "ISO/IEC TR 25060:2010 describes a potential family of International Standards,
    named the Common Industry Formats (CIF), that document the specification and evaluation
    of the usability of interactive systems. It provides a general overview of the
    CIF framework and contents, definitions, and the relationship of the framework
    elements. The intended users of the framework are identified, as well as the situations
    in which the framework may be applied. The assumptions and constraints of the
    framework are also enumerated.\nThe framework content includes the following:\n-
    consistent terminology and classification of specification, evaluation and reporting;
    \n- a definition of the type and scope of formats and the high-level structure
    to be used for documenting required information and the results of evaluation.\nISO/IEC
    TR 25060:2010 is applicable to software and hardware products used for predefined
    tasks. The information items are intended to be used as part of system-level documentation
    resulting from development processes such as those in ISO 9241-210, and ISO/IEC
    JTC 1/SC 7 process standards.\nISO/IEC TR 25060:2010 focuses on documenting those
    elements needed for design and development of usable systems, rather than prescribing
    a specific process. It is intended to be used in conjunction with existing International
    Standards, including ISO 9241, ISO 20282, ISO/IEC 9126 and the SQuaRE series (ISO/IEC
    25000 to ISO/IEC 25099).\nISO/IEC TR 25060:2010 does not prescribe any kind of
    method, life cycle or process."
