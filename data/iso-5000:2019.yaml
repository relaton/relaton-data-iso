    This document is applicable to the minimum requirements for steel sheet, in coils and cut lengths, metallic-coated by the continuous hot-dip process, with aluminium-silicon alloy coating.
    The product is intended for heat-resisting applications and also where both corrosion and heat resistance are required.
    The steel sheet is produced in a number of quality designations and grades, coating mass, surface treatments and coating finish conditions to be compatible with differing application requirements.
