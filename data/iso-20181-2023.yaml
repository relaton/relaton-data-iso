    This document specifies procedures for establishing quality assurance levels (QAL) for automated measuring systems (AMS) installed on industrial plants for the determination of the flue gas components and other flue gas parameters.
    This document specifies:
    —    a procedure (QAL2) to calibrate the AMS and determine the variability of the measured values obtained by it, so as to demonstrate the suitability of the AMS for its application, following its installation;
    —    a procedure (QAL3) to maintain and demonstrate the required quality of the measurement results during the normal operation of an AMS, by checking that the zero and span characteristics are consistent with those determined during QAL1;
    —    a procedure for the annual surveillance tests (AST) of the AMS in order to evaluate (i) that it functions correctly and its performance remains valid and (ii) that its calibration function and variability remain as previously determined.
    This document is designed to be used after the AMS has been certified in accordance with the series of documents EN 15267.
