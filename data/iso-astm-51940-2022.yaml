    1.1 This document outlines dosimetric procedures to be followed for the radiation-induced reproductive sterilization of live insects for use in pest management programs. The primary use of such insects is in the Sterile Insect Technique, where large numbers of reproductively sterile insects are released into the field to mate with and thus control pest populations of the same species. A secondary use of sterile insects is as benign hosts for rearing insect parasitoids. A third use is for testing detection traps for fruit flies and moths, and testing mating disruption products for moths. The procedures outlined in this document will help ensure that insects processed with ionizing radiation from gamma, electron, or X-ray sources receive absorbed doses within a predetermined range. Information on effective dose ranges for specific applications of insect sterilization, or on methodology for determining effective dose ranges, is not within the scope of this document.
    NOTE 1—Dosimetry is only one component of a total quality assurance program to ensure that irradiated insects are adequately sterilized and fully competitive or otherwise suitable for their intended purpose.
    1.2 This document provides information on dosimetry for the irradiation of insects for these types of irradiators: selfcontained dry-storage 137Cs or 60Co irradiators, self-contained low-energy X-ray irradiators (maximum processing energies from 150 keV to 300 keV), large-scale gamma irradiators, and electron accelerators (electron and X-ray modes).
    NOTE 2—Additional, detailed information on dosimetric procedures to be followed in installation qualification, operational qualification, performance qualification, and routine product processing can be found in ISO/ASTM Practices 51608 (X-ray [bremsstrahlung] facilities processing at energies over 300 keV), 51649 (electron beam facilities), 51702 (large-scale gamma facilities), and 52116 (self-contained dry-storage gamma facilities), and in Ref (1)2 (self-contained X-ray facilities).
    1.3 The values stated in SI units are to be regarded as standard. No other units of measurement are included in this standard except for the non-SI units of minute (min) hour (h) and day (d). These non-SI units are accepted for use within the SI system.
    1.4 This document is one of a set of standards that provides recommendations for properly implementing and utilizing radiation processing. It is intended to be read in conjunction with ISO/ASTM Practice 52628.
    1.5 The absorbed dose for insect sterilization is typically within the range of 20 Gy to 600 Gy.
    1.6 This document refers, throughout the text, specifically to reproductive sterilization of insects. It is equally applicable to radiation sterilization of invertebrates from other taxa (for example, Acarina, Gastropoda) and to irradiation of live insects or other invertebrates for other purposes (for example, inducing mutations), provided the absorbed dose is within the range specified in 1.5.
    1.7 This document also covers the use of radiation-sensitive indicators for the visual and qualitative indication that the insects have been irradiated (see ISO/ASTM Guide 51539).
    1.8 This standard does not purport to address all of the safety concerns, if any, associated with its use. It is the responsibility of the user of this standard to establish appropriate safety, health, and environmental practices and determine the applicability of regulatory limitations prior to use.
    1.9 This international standard was developed in accordance with internationally recognized principles on standardization established in the Decision on Principles for the Development of International Standards, Guides and Recommendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.
