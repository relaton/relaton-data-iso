abstract:
- content: In dynamic measuring systems the performance of meters for liquid hydrocarbons
    will vary with changes in flow conditions, viz. flowrate, viscosity, temperature,
    pressure, density of product, and with mechanical wear. Has been prepared as a
    guide for establishing and monitoring the performance of such meters, using appropriate
    statistical control procedures for both central and on-line proving. These procedures
    may be applied to measurements made by any type of volumetric or mass metering
    systems. The procedures to be followed for collecting data, on which the control
    limits are based, are described.
