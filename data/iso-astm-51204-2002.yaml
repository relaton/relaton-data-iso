    This practice outlines dosimetric procedures to be followed in irradiator characterization, process qualification, and routine processing of food with ionizing radiation from isotopic gamma sources to ensure that all the product has been treated within a predetermined range of absorbed dose. Other procedures related to irradiator characterization, process qualification, and routine processing that may influence absorbed dose in the product are also discussed. Information about effective or regulatory dose limits for food products is not within the scope of this practice (see ASTM Guides F 1355 and F 1356).
    NOTE 1 Dosimetry is only one component of a total quality assurance program for adherence to good manufacturing practices used in the production of safe and wholesome food.
    NOTE 2 ISO/ASTM Practice 51431 describes dosimetric procedures for electron beam and bremsstrahlung (X-ray) irradiation facilities for food processing.
    For guidance in the selection and calibration of dosimeters, and interpretation of measured absorbed dose in the product, see ISO/ASTM Guide 51261 and ASTM Practice E 666. For the use of specific dosimetry systems, see ASTM Practices E 668, E 1026 and ISO/ASTM Practices 51205, 51275, 51276, 51310, 51401, 51538, 51540, 51607 and 51650. For discussion of radiation dosimetry for gamma rays and X-rays also see ICRU Report 14.
    This standard does not purport to address all of the safety concerns, if any, associated with its use. It is the responsibility of the user of this standard to establish appropriate safety and health practices and determine the applicability of regulatory limitations prior to use.
