abstract:
- content: |-
    This document surveys the range of existing sustainability frameworks available for critical mineral supply chains to aid understanding and assist in improving an organization’s sustainability outcomes. It includes an analysis of:
    —     the requirements contained in existing sustainability guides or frameworks and where these tools are similar and where they diverge;
    —     sustainability topic areas within existing guides and frameworks that have been accepted in different regions and jurisdictions.
    This document did not assess the effectiveness of existing standards or frameworks in improving the sustainability performance of their users or how performance was assessed.
    The results show that the existing sustainability frameworks are extensive and varied in the upstream supply chain. The analysis undertaken as part of this document will help inform the development of potential future ISO work programs and standards development, without duplicating or conflicting with existing frameworks.
    This document can also be used by organizations outside of ISO with respect to understanding available sustainability standards or frameworks.
