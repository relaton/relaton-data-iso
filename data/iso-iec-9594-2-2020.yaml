  content: "This document provides a conceptual and terminological framework for the
    other ITU-T X.500-series Recommendations | parts of ISO/IEC 9594 which define
    various aspects of the Directory.\nThe functional and administrative authority
    models define ways in which the Directory can be distributed, both functionally
    and administratively. Generic Directory System Agent (DSA) and DSA information
    models and an Operational Framework are also provided to support Directory distribution.\nThe
    generic Directory Information Models describe the logical structure of the Directory
    Information Base (DIB) from the perspective of Directory and Administrative Users.
    In these models, the fact that the Directory is distributed, rather than centralized,
    is not visible. \nThis Recommendation | International Standard provides a specialization
    of the generic Directory Information Models to support Directory Schema administration.\nThe
    other ITU-T Recommendations in the X.500 series | parts of ISO/IEC 9594 make use
    of the concepts defined in this Recommendation | International Standard to define
    specializations of the generic information and DSA models to provide specific
    information, DSA and operational models supporting particular directory capabilities
    (e.g., Replication):\na)    the service provided by the Directory is described
    (in Rec. ITU-T X.511 | ISO/IEC 9594-3) in terms of the concepts of the information
    framework: this allows the service provided to be somewhat independent of the
    physical distribution of the DIB;\nb)    the distributed operation of the Directory
    is specified (in Rec. ITU-T X.518 | ISO/IEC 9594-4) so as to provide that service,
    and therefore maintain that logical information structure, given that the DIB
    is in fact highly distributed;\nc)    replication capabilities offered by the
    component parts of the Directory to improve overall Directory performance are
    specified (in Rec. ITU-T X.525 | ISO/IEC 9594-9).\nThe security model establishes
    a framework for the specification of access control mechanisms. It provides a
    mechanism for identifying the access control scheme in effect in a particular
    portion of the Directory Information Tree (DIT), and it defines three flexible,
    specific access control schemes which are suitable for a wide variety of applications
    and styles of use. The security model also provides a framework for protecting
    the confidentiality and integrity of directory operations using mechanisms such
    as encryption and digital signatures. This makes use of the framework for authentication
    defined in Rec. ITU-T X.509 | ISO/IEC 9594-8 as well as generic upper layers security
    tools defined in Rec. ITU-T X.830 | ISO/IEC 11586-1.\nDSA models establish a framework
    for the specification of the operation of the components of the Directory. Specifically:\na)
    \   the Directory functional model describes how the Directory is manifested as
    a set of one or more components, each being a DSA;\nb)    the Directory distribution
    model describes the principals according to which the DIB entries and entry‑copies
    may be distributed among DSAs;\nc)    the DSA information model describes the
    structure of the Directory user and operational information held in a DSA;\nd)
    \         the DSA operational framework describes the means by which the definition
    of specific forms of cooperation between DSAs to achieve particular objectives
    (e.g., shadowing) is structured."
