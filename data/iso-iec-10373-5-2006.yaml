abstract:
- content: "ISO 10373 defines test methods for characteristics of identification cards
    as defined in ISO/IEC 7810. Each test method is cross-referenced to one or more
    base standards, which may be ISO/IEC 7810 or one or more of the supplementary
    standards that define the information storage technologies employed in identification
    cards applications.\nCriteria for acceptability do not form part of ISO 10373
    but will be found in the International Standards mentioned above.\nTest methods
    defined in ISO 10373 are intended to be performed separately. A given card is
    not required to pass through all the tests sequentially.\nISO 10373-1 deals with
    test methods which are common to one or more card technologies and other parts
    deal with other technology-specific tests.\nISO 10373-5:2006 deals with test methods
    which are specific to optical memory card technology. "
