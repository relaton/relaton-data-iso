    ISO/IEC 13868:2003 specifies the signalling protocol for the support of name identification supplementary services at the Q reference point between Private Integrated services Network eXchanges (PINXs) connected together within a Private Integrated Services Network (PISN). The name identification supplementary services are Calling Name Identification Presentation (SS-CNIP) and Connected Name Identification Presentation (SS-CONP).
    Calling Name Identification Presentation (CNIP) is a supplementary service which is offered to the called user and which provides the name of the calling user (calling party name) to the called user.
    Connected Name Identification Presentation (CONP) is a supplementary service which is offered to the calling user and which provides to the calling user the following:
    - the name of the user who answers the call (connected party name);
    - optionally the name of the alerting user (called party name);
    - optionally the name of the called user who cannot be reached (busy party name).
    The supplementary service Calling/Connected Name Identification Restriction (CNIR) has no impact on the signalling at Q reference point.
    Provision of a user's name to the PISN is outside the scope of ISO/IEC 13868:2003.
    The Q reference point is defined in ISO/IEC 11579-1.
    Service specifications are produced in three stages according to the method specified in ETS 300 387. ISO/IEC 13868:2003 contains the stage 3 specification for the Q reference point and satisfies the requirements identified by the stage 1 and stage 2 specifications in ISO/IEC 13864.
