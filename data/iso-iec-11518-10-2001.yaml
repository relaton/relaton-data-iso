  script: Latn
  content: "This part of ISO/IEC 11518 specifies a physical-level, point-to-point,
    full-duplex, link interface for reliable, flow-controlled transmission of user
    data at 6 400 Mbit/s per direction, across distances of up to 1 km. A parallel
    copper cable interface for distances of up to 40 m is specified. Connections to
    a separate longer-distance optical interface are provided. Small fixed-size micropackets
    provide an efficient, low-latency structure for small transfers, and a component
    for large transfers. \nSpecifications are included for:\n ? automatic retransmission
    to correct flawed data;\n ? the format of a small data transfer unit called a
    micropacket;\n ? a message structure that includes routing information for network
    applications;\n ? end-to-end, as well as link-to-link, checksums; \n? the timing
    requirements of the parallel signals;\n ? a parallel interface using copper coaxial
    cable;\n ? connections to a separate local optical interface;\n ? a link-level
    protocol tuned for a maximum distance of 1 km."
