abstract:
- content: ISO 9635-1:2006 specifies construction and performance requirements and
    test methods for valves, intended for operation in irrigation systems with water
    at temperatures not exceeding 60 °C, which can contain fertilizers and other chemicals
    of the types and concentrations used in agriculture. It is applicable to irrigation
    valves of 15 mm diameter or greater, designed to operate in the fully open and
    fully closed positions, but which can also operate for extended time periods in
    any intermediate position.
