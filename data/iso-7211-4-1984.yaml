abstract:
- content: Only applicable to yarns spun on conventional systems and not applicable
    to OE (open-end spun) or interlaced yarns, for example. A length of yarn is removed
    from the fabric and, while under tension, is secured in two clamps which are at
    a known distance apart. One of these clamps is then rotated until all twist is
    removed from the length of yarn.
