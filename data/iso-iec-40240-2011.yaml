abstract:
- content: Web Services Addressing provides transport-neutral mechanisms to address
    Web services and messages. ISO/IEC 42040:2011 defines a set of abstract properties
    and an XML Infoset representation thereof to reference Web services and to facilitate
    end-to-end addressing of endpoints in messages. It enables messaging systems to
    support message transmission through networks that include processing nodes such
    as endpoint managers, firewalls, and gateways in a transport-neutral manner.
