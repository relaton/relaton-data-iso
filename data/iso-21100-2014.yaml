    The purpose ISO 21100:2014 is to establish the minimum requirements for airworthiness approval of air cargo pallets, nets and containers, generally designated as air cargo unit load devices.
    ISO 21100:2014 defines the minimum performance requirements and test parameters for air cargo unit load devices requiring approval of airworthiness for installation in an approved aircraft cargo compartment and restraint system that complies with the cargo restraint and occupant protection requirements of EASA CS-25 or 14 CFR Part 25, except for the 9,0 g forward ultimate inertia force.
    ISO 21100:2014 applies to airworthiness approved air cargo unit load devices intended for carriage on board civil transport category airplanes type certificated under EASA CS-25 or 14 CFR Part 25.
    ISO 21100:2014 exclusively applies to unit load devices airworthiness approval and testing parameters. It does not apply to either aircraft design or aircraft operating requirements, which are provided by the approved Weight and Balance Manual for each aircraft type.
