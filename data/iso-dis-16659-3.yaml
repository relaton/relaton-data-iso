abstract:
- content: This proposed standard is recommended a method for determining the performances
    and leak tightness of iodine adsorbers in nuclear air cleaning systems of personnel
    habitable spaces of nuclear facilities to solve the radiation safety and environmental
    safety problems of traditional test methods. The test flowchart and evaluation
    procedure of the cyclohexane method are given in the attachments of this standard.
