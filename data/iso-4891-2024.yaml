    This document provides operational and performance requirements for smart applications on board ships. It is applicable to documentation, process management, connection and data collection through human-machine interfaces, IoT technologies and related systems.
    This document defines methods to implement smart network applications, which are open to participants who implement the requirements defined in this document.
    This document also describes a smart logbook application that can be used as a supplement to ISO 21745, thus this document is subject to the same security requirements as in ISO 21745 (see Annex B).
    This document defines three incremental levels of equipment-classes (see 7.1.1):
    a)    4891-compliant equipment (as described in Clauses 5 to 7);
    b)    4891.A-compliant equipment (as described in Clauses 5 to 7 and Annex A);
    c)    4891.B-compliant equipment (as described in Clauses 5 to 7 and Annexes A and B).
