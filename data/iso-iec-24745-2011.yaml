  content: "ISO/IEC 24745:2011 provides guidance for the protection of biometric information
    under various requirements for confidentiality, integrity and renewability/revocability
    during storage and transfer. Additionally, ISO/IEC 24745:2011 provides requirements
    and guidelines for the secure and privacy-compliant management and processing
    of biometric information.\nISO/IEC 24745:2011 specifies the following:\n- analysis
    of the threats to and countermeasures inherent in a biometric and biometric system
    application models;\n- security requirements for secure binding between a biometric
    reference and an identity reference; \n- biometric system application models with
    different scenarios for the storage of biometric references and comparison; and\n-
    guidance on the protection of an individual's privacy during the processing of
    biometric information.\nISO/IEC 24745:2011 does not include general management
    issues related to physical security, environmental security and key management
    for cryptographic techniques."
