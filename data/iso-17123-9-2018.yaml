    This document specifies field procedures for determining and evaluating the precision (repeatability) of terrestrial laser scanners and their ancillary equipment when used in building, civil engineering and surveying measurements. Primarily, these tests are intended to be field verifications of the suitability of a particular instrument for the immediate task at hand, and to satisfy the requirements of other standards. They are not proposed as tests for acceptance or performance evaluations that are more comprehensive in nature.
    This document can be thought of as one of the first steps in the process of evaluating the uncertainty of measurements (more specifically of measurands).
