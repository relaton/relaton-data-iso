    ISO 8143:2010 specifies the requirements for factory-made calcium silicate products which are used for thermal insulation of industrial installations and building equipment with an operating temperature of up to approximately +1 100 °C.
    NOTE          Calcium silicate products can be used at temperatures lower than 0 °C. For operating temperatures below 0 °C, special tests, regarding the suitability of the product in the intended application, are advised (e.g. liquefaction of oxygen). It is advisable to seek the advice of the manufacturer(s) in all cases.
    The products are manufactured in the form of boards, pipe sections, segments and prefabricated ware.
    ISO 8143:2010 describes product characteristics and includes procedures for testing, evaluation of conformity, marking and labelling.
    Products covered by ISO 8143:2010 are also used in prefabricated thermal insulation systems and composite panels; the structural performance of systems incorporating these products is not covered.
