    ISO/TS 19858:2015 defines test procedures for classifying the lubrication ability of saw chain lubrication oils when using guide bar and saw chain.
    These test procedures create a reproducible replication of the stress conditions experienced by the saw chain and guide bar during sawing. The test shows the capacity of the lubricant for reducing the wear between friction partners.
    This enables the manufacturers of chain saws to include specifications for recommended saw chain lubrication oils in the owner's manual.
    The test rig is based on a design produced by the Swedish test commission Svensk Maskinprovning (SMP). The test procedures also take into account the long-term practical experience of the Kuratorium für Waldarbeit und Forsttechnik e.V (KWF) in testing bio-degradable chain lubrication oils.
