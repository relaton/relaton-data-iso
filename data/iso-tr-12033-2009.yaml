abstract:
- content: "ISO/TR 12033:2009 gives information to enable a user or electronic image
    management (EIM) integrator to make an informed decision on selecting compression
    methods for digital images of business documents. It provides technical guidance
    to analyse the type of documents and which compression methods are most suitable
    for particular documents in order to optimize their storage and use.\nFor the
    user, ISO/TR 12033:2009 provides information on image compression methods incorporated
    in hardware or software in order to help the user during the selection of equipment
    in which the methods are embedded.\nFor the equipment or software designer, ISO/TR
    12033:2009 provides planning information. \nISO/TR 12033:2009 is applicable only
    to still images in bit map mode. It only takes into account compression algorithms
    based on well-tested mathematical work."
