    ISO/TS 13582:2015 specifies the mandatory and optional information to be recorded in any registry of OIDs, using an information model.
    It specifies which parts of that information are to be regarded as public and which parts are to be subject to security and privacy requirements.
    All registries support the recording of mandatory information, but the recording of any specific object identifier in one or more repositories is always optional. In some cases, security and privacy requirements are more stringent for e-health applications.
    In detail, this Technical Specification:
    -      specifies an information model and a corresponding XML format for the export of the contents of an OID registry, suitable e.g. for import to a different OID registry;
    -      references common Use Cases for OID registries/repositories;
    -      references an Object Identifier Resolution System (ORS) which provides a look-up mechanism for information related to an object identifier, with guidance on the use of that facility.
