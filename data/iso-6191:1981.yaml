- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: Describes a method applicable to products having water contents between
    10 and 100 mg/kg. Specifies the manner of applications of the Karl-Fischer method,
    whose principle and chemical reaction are given in ISO 760 which should also be
    used for higher water contents as sampling is not valid when there is a risk that
    condensation of water may occur. The principle consists in absorbing the traces
    of water in a test portion in a solvent to which a sufficient quantitty of Karl-Fischer
    reagent has been added so that there is neither an excess of water nor an excess
    of the Karl Fischer reagent, when the solvent is said to be at the equivalence
    point.
