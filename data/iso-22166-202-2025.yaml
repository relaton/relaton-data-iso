    This document specifies requirements and recommendations for information models for software modules used in service robots. This document specifies the information model for software modules related to nine principles in ISO 22166-1.
    It specifies a structured method to define the characteristics of a software module, or a module that has a software-related interface (modules with software aspects, as defined in ISO 22166-1).
    This document is not a safety standard. However, it specifies the information necessary for software modules, including safety-related information.
    This document focuses on interfaces, properties, composition and execution-specific information, which are related to software modules. The information is utilized in the runtime and design/developing stages. In particular, the interfaces are classified and described into two types such as variables and methods. The document can also be applied to the following software lifecycle stages: the design stage, development stage, operation stage, and maintenance stage.
