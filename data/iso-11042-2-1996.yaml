  content: 'Establishes the monitoring programme and the requirements for the selection
    and operation of hardware to be used for continuous gas emission measurements.
    Monitores the concentration and absolute magnitude of specified emissions in the
    exhaust gas as well as related gaseous components. Requires that the following
    parameters be continuously monitored: emissions, diluent gases (oxygen, carbon
    dioxide), exhaust gas flow, fuel consumption and gas turbine performance.'
