abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 15909-2:2011 defines an XML-based transfer format for Petri nets,
    which are defined conceptually and mathematically in ISO/IEC 15909-1. This transfer
    format enables the exchange of Petri nets among different Petri net tools and
    among different parties. Moreover, ISO/IEC 15909-2:2011 defines some concepts
    and XML-based syntax for defining the detailed graphical appearance of Petri nets.\nThe
    focus of ISO/IEC 15909-2:2011 is on the transfer format for Place/Transition Nets,
    High-level Petri Nets and Symmetric Nets. The presentation, however, is structured
    in such a way that it is open for future extensions, so that other versions of
    Petri nets can be added later. The exact definition of this extension mechanism,
    called Petri net type definition, is not defined in ISO/IEC 15909-2:2011; it will
    be defined in ISO/IEC 15909-3.\nThe transfer format will be used to transfer specifications
    of systems developed in High-level Petri Nets between tools to facilitate the
    development of systems in teams. \nISO/IEC 15909-2:2011 is written as a reference
    for developers of Petri net tools. It will also be useful for researchers who
    define new versions and variants of Petri nets."
