    1.1 Goals
    In addition to the goals of the Base Language, the goal of this part of ISO/IEC 10514 is to
    provide simple extensions to allow object oriented programming facilities to be added to the
    Base Language defined in International Standard ISO/IEC 10514-1 without altering the
    meaning of any valid program allowed by the Base Language (except for the use of the new
    keywords introduced by this standard, see clause 5).
    1.2 Specifications included in this part of ISO/IEC 10514
    In addition to the specifications included in the Base Language this part of ISO/IEC 10514
    provides specifications for:
    — required symbols for Object Oriented Modula-2 programs;
    — the lexical structure, the syntactic structure and semantics of Object Oriented Modula-2
    programs;
    — the interface to and the semantics of Object Oriented Modula-2 system modules;
    — violations of the rules for the use of the object oriented extensions that a conforming
    implementation is required to detect;
    — further compliance requirements for implementations, including documentation
    requirements.
    1.3 Relationship to ISO/IEC 10514-1
    This part of ISO/IEC 10514 is part three of the multi-part standard ISO/IEC 10514. This part
    of ISO/IEC 10514 extends and modifies the Base Language ISO/IEC 10514-1, but the
    adoption of this part of ISO/IEC 10514 is optional with respect to the Base Language. This
    part of ISO/IEC 10514 is also independent of any other parts of ISO/IEC 10514 except for
    part 1, and can be adopted either together with or independently of such other parts.
    1.4 Specifications not within the scope of this part of ISO/IEC 10514
    In addition to the categories of specifications excluded by the Base Language this part of
    ISO/IEC 10514 provides no specifications for:
    — the internal representation of the objects and their associated methods;
    — the implementation of the garbage collector;
    — the implementation of the tracking mechanism for traced objects.
