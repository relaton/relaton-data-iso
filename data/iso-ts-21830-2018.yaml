abstract:
- content: This document specifies a procedure, including computation, for extending
    the method described in ISO 18619:2015 to n-colour ICC profiles specifically for
    the xCLR cases where the colourants are either CMYK plus combinations from the
    set of red, orange, green, blue and violet or where, for the 3CLR case, the colourants
    are CMY-like chromatic colourants with widely-spaced hue angles.  Other types
    of colour spaces which are otherwise permitted by 15076-1, such as 2CLR (two-device
    colourants), are not addressed by this document.
