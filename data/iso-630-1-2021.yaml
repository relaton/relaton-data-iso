    This document specifies the general technical delivery conditions for steel flat and long products (plates/ sections/wide flats and bars) used principally for general-purpose structural steels. The steels specified in this document are intended for use in welded or bolted structures.
    The specific requirements for structural steels are given in the individual parts of ISO 630.
    This document does not include the following structural steels, some of which are covered by other International Standards:
    —    sheet and strip: refer to ISO TC 17/SC 12 “Continuous mill flat rolled products”;
    —    tubular products: refer to ISO TC 5/SC 1 “Steel tubes”.
    NOTE 1    Lists of standards covered by ISO/TC 17/SC 12 and ISO/TC 5/SC 1 are available on the ISO website.
    NOTE 2    In all parts of ISO 630, the term of "thickness" is considered as "nominal thickness", unless otherwise stated.
