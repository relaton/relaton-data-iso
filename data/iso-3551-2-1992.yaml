abstract:
- content: 'Establishes the nomenclature and lays down the leading dimensions to ensure
    interchangeability within the limits of system A of the following equipment: drill
    rods and couplings; casings, casing couplings, casing bits, casing shoes, drive
    shoes and casing ream shells; core barrels, core bits, core lifters and reaming
    shells. Specifies the characteristics of a range of equipment for drilling holes
    having diameters from 1.18 in to 7.88 in and yielding cores having diameters from
    0.73 in to 6.5 in.'
