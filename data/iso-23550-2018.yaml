  content: "ISO 23550:2018 specifies safety, construction, performance and testing
    requirements for controls for gas burners and gas burning appliances for use with
    natural gas, manufactured gas or liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). \nISO 23550:2018
    applies to controls for use at maximum operating pressures up to and including
    500 kPa. This document provides the general requirements that are intended to
    be the basis for the specific control standards found in the ISO 23551 and ISO
    23552 series. These include the following:\n-      automatic and semi-automatic
    gas valves;\n-      gas thermoelectric flame supervision controls;\n-      gas
    and oil /air ratio controls;\n-      gas pressure regulators;\n-      manual gas
    valves;\n-      mechanical gas thermostats;\n-      multifunctional gas controls;\n-
    \     air and gas pressure-sensing devices;\n-      gas vent valves;\n-      gas
    valve-proving systems.\nISO 23550:2018 covers type testing only.\nISO 23550:2018
    is also applicable to Gas Quick Connectors (GQC) for use inside appliances with
    connections up to, and including DN 25, and a maximum operating pressure up to
    and including 100 kPa. GQCs include:\n-      tube to tube connections;\n-      tube
    to control connections; and\n-      tube to fitting connections.\nISO 23550:2018
    does not apply to mechanical controls for use with liquid fuels. It is also not
    applicable to corrosive and waste gases."
