abstract:
- content: "ISO/TS 19620:2018 specifies a method primarily developed for the determination
    of inorganic arsenic species (arsenite (As(III)) and arsenate (As(V)) dissolved
    in a sample after a preservation process in waters with a low total organic carbon
    content such as potable water, tap water, surface waters, ground waters and rain
    waters. Information is provided on the determination of potentially relevant organo-arsenic
    species such as methylarsonic acid (MMA) and dimethylarsinic acid (DMA) which
    may be encountered at very low levels in natural surface waters. \nThe linear
    working dynamic range depends on the operating conditions and the method of detection
    used; under standard conditions, it typically ranges from 0,5 µg/l to 50 µg/l
    for each species. Samples containing arsenic at concentrations higher than the
    linear dynamic range can be analysed after suitable dilution.\nThis method is
    based on high performance liquid chromatography separation of arsenic species
    with either inductively coupled mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) or hydride generation
    atomic fluorescence spectrometry (HG-AFS) as a method of detection.\nThe sensitivity
    of this method depends on the method of detection and the instrumental operating
    conditions selected. The limit of quantification (LOQ) of the method also depends
    on the operating conditions of the analytical system used and the extent of the
    calibration range used. LOQ examples for As(III) and As(V) are provided; LOQs
    are generally less than 1 µg/l. \nISO/TS 19620:2018 does not apply to arsenobetaine
    and other organic arsenic species which are not present in natural water samples."
