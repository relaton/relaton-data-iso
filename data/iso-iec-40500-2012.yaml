abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 40500:2012 [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0] covers
    a wide range of recommendations for making Web content more accessible. Following
    these guidelines will make content accessible to a wider range of people with
    disabilities, including blindness and low vision, deafness and hearing loss, learning
    disabilities, cognitive limitations, limited movement, speech disabilities, photo-sensitivity
    and combinations of these. Following these guidelines will also often make your
    Web content more usable to users in general. \nWCAG 2.0 success criteria are written
    as testable statements that  are not technology-specific. Guidance about satisfying
    the success criteria in specific technologies, as well as general information
    about interpreting the success criteria, is provided in separate documents.\nAn
    overview of WCAG 2.0, the WCAG 2.0 standard, technical and education material
    supporting implementation of WCAG 2.0, and information on translating WCAG 2.0,
    are freely available from Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) Overview."
