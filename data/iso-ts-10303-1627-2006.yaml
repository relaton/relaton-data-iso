  content: "ISO/TS 10303-1627:2006 specifies the application module for AP210 printed
    part functional and physical characterization. \nISO/TS 10303-1627:2006 deals
    with the representation of printed part functional and physical characterization.
    Printed part data includes following information:\n- device model;\n- layout template
    data;\n- functional data;\n- environmental constraints;\n- performance data;\n-
    simulation models. \nSufficient data is provided for product realization as part
    of a higher level interconnect realization process. Mapping of analysis model
    connection points to printed part terminals is provided. Formal encapsulation
    of external data type definitions is made for parametric data and analysis models.
    Pin mapping is provided to ensure consistency between device views. Shape, material,
    technology, tolerance on shape and on parameters, units are included. Shapes included
    may be categorized according to discipline (e.g. thermal analysis, vibration analysis),
    and analysis environment (e.g. design, assembly, enduser). Geometric dimensioning
    and tolerancing is included. The functional data includes two distinct data sets:
    \n- hierarchical functional decomposition into behavioural elements embedded in
    a network represented at each level by a nodal formulation; \n- collection of
    device terminals that implement the functionality of a network node. \nConfiguration
    management information and design change management information is provided. This
    data includes at least one geometric representation. \nThe following are within
    the scope of ISO/TS 10303-1627:2006:\n- printed layout template; \n- functional
    network representation; \n- pin mapping to simulation models; \n- configuration
    management; \n- design change management."
