    This document specifies requirements for the design, construction, safety, performance and acceptance testing of dual traction/stowage winches for oceanographic research (hereafter referred as to “dual traction/stowage winches”), with hydraulic and electric drive.
    Dual traction/stowage winches are mainly used for fixed-point and towing marine survey, involving marine geological sampling, seawater water body parameter measurement and marine biological survey.
