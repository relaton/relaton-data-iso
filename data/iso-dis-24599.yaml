abstract:
- content: "The document provides guidelines for the management of mobile toilets
    under Public Health Emergencies (PHEs) from different perspectives, including
    users, operators, and suppliers. It also creates a safe sanitation service for
    the users, cleaners, and manure transporters. It is applicable to epidemic situations
    of major respiratory tract and intestinal infectious diseases, but not to group
    unexplained diseases, major food and occupational poisoning and other events that
    seriously affect public health. \nThis document includes the following:\n— Key
    components and characteristics of mobile toilets under PHEs; \n— Environmental
    and risk management of mobile toilets under PHEs;\n— Planning, construction and
    the subsequent evacuation of mobile toilets under PHEs;\n— Operation and maintenance;
    \n— Health and safety issues\n·from the perspective of users (users protection
    guide)\n·from the perspective of cleaners and manure transporters (toilet cleaning
    and disinfection, on-site pre-treatment and disinfection of the manure and flushing
    water, manure transportation)\n·from the perspective of suppliers (testing and
    inspection, identification and packaging, transportation and storage) \n— Rapid
    response mechanism of mobile toilets under PHEs."
