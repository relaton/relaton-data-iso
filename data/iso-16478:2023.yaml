    This document:
    —     defines requirements for vacuum insulation panels (VIPs) with silica or glass fibre core, which are used for thermal insulation of buildings;
    —     outlines required product properties, their performance, test methods and rules for conformity evaluations, identification and labelling;
    —     provides a test method to determine ageing factors and the influence of the linear thermal bridges at the edges.
    This document is applicable to all types of silica and glass fibre core VIPs, independent of the type of envelope. In the case of a glass fibre core VIP, it is only applicable to VIPs with desiccants whose service life is ≥ 25 years.
    This document is not applicable to:
    —     any specific installation and application requirements;
    —     products intended to be used for the insulation of building equipment and industrial installations.
