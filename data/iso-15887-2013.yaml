  content: "ISO 15887:2013 establishes a source-coding data-compression algorithm
    applied to digital data and specifies how these compressed data shall be inserted
    into source packets for retrieval and decoding.\nSource coding for data compression
    is a method utilized in data systems to reduce the volume of digital data to achieve
    benefits in areas including, but not limited to:\n- reduction of transmission
    channel bandwidth;\n- reduction of the buffering and storage requirement;\n- reduction
    of data-transmission time at a given rate.\nThe characteristics of source codes
    are specified only to the extent necessary to ensure multi-mission support capabilities.
    ISO 15887:2013 does not attempt to quantify the relative bandwidth reduction,
    the merits of each approach discussed, or the design requirements for coders and
    associated decoders. Some performance information is included in CCSDS 120.0-G-2.\nISO
    15887:2013 addresses only Lossless source coding, which is applicable to a wide
    range of digital data, both imaging and non-imaging, where the requirement is
    for a moderate data-rate reduction constrained to allow no distortion to be added
    in the data compression/decompression process. The decompression process is not
    addressed. "
