    ISO 8253-3:2012 specifies basic methods for speech recognition tests for audiological applications.
    In order to ensure minimum requirements of precision and comparability between different test procedures including speech recognition tests in different languages, ISO 8253-3:2012 specifies requirements for the composition, validation and evaluation of speech test materials, and the realization of speech recognition tests. ISO 8253-3:2012 does not specify the contents of the speech material because of the variety of languages.
    Furthermore, ISO 8253-3:2012 also specifies the determination of reference values and fulfilment requirements for the realization and manner of presentation.
    ISO 8253-3:2012 specifies procedures and requirements for speech audiometry with the recorded test material being presented by air conduction through an earphone, or from a loudspeaker for sound field audiometry. Methods for using noise either for masking the non-test ear or as a competing sound are described.
    Some test subjects, for example children, can require amended test procedures not specified in ISO 8253-3:2012.
    Specialized tests such as those used for evaluating directional hearing and dichotic hearing are outside the scope of ISO 8253-3:2012.
