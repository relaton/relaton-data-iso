abstract:
- content: "This document specifies cryptographic mechanisms to redact authentic data.
    The mechanisms described in this document offer different combinations of the
    security properties defined and described in ISO/IEC 23264-1. For all mechanisms,
    this document describes the processes for key generation, generating the redactable
    attestation, carrying out redactions and verifying redactable attestations.\nThis
    document contains mechanisms that are based on asymmetric cryptography using three
    related transformations:\n¾      a public transformation defined by a verification
    key (verification process for verifying a redactable attestation),\n¾      a private
    transformation defined by a private attestation key (redactable attestation process
    for generating a redactable attestation), and\n¾      a third transformation defined
    by the redaction key (redaction process) allowing to redact authentic information
    within the constraints set forth during generation of the attestation such that
    redacted information cannot be reconstructed.  \nThis document contains mechanisms
    which, after a successful redaction, allow the attestation to remain verifiable
    using the verification transformation and attest that non-redacted fields of the
    attested message are unmodified. This document further details that the three
    transformations have the property whereby it is computationally infeasible to
    derive the private attestation transformation, given the redaction and or the
    verification transformation and key(s)."
