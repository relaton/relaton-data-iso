    This document specifies requirements for two types of reinforced hoses and hose assemblies of nominal size from 3,2 to 25, dependent on relation of minimum burst pressure to maximum working pressure. Each type is divided into classes dependent on maximum working pressure.
    They are suitable for use with:
    —    oil-based hydraulic fluids HH, HL, HM, HR and HV as defined in ISO 6743-4 at temperatures ranging from −40 °C to +100 °C;
    —    water-based fluids HFC, HFAE, HFAS and HFB as defined in ISO 6743-4 at temperatures ranging from 0 °C to +70 °C;
    —    water at temperatures ranging from 0 °C to +70 °C.
    Such hoses and hose assemblies are intended to be used for:
    —    water jetting and water blasting applications;
    —    hydraulic applications.
    This document does not include requirements for end fittings. It is limited to the performance of hoses and hose assemblies.
    NOTE 1   It is the responsibility of the user, in consultation with the hose manufacturer, to establish the compatibility of the hose with the fluid to be used.
    NOTE 2   For hydraulic jacks with manually driven pumps, hoses and hose assemblies per ISO 16301 can be used.
