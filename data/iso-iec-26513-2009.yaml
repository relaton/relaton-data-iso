abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 26513:2009 supports the interest of software users in receiving
    consistent, complete, accurate, and usable documentation. It defines the process
    in which user documentation products are tested.\nISO/IEC 26513:2009 is intended
    neither to encourage nor discourage the use of either printed or electronic (on-screen)
    media for documentation, or of any particular documentation testing or management
    tools or methodologies. \nISO/IEC 26513:2009 specifies processes for use in testing
    and reviewing of user documentation. It is not limited to the test and review
    phase of the life cycle, but includes activities throughout the Information Management
    and Documentation Management processes. \nISO/IEC 26513:2009 provides the minimum
    requirements for the testing and reviewing of user documentation, including both
    printed and on-screen documents used in the work environment by the users of systems
    software. It applies to printed user manuals, online help, tutorials, and user
    reference documentation.\nThe order of clauses in ISO/IEC 26513:2009 does not
    imply that the software user documentation should be tested in this order. \nIn
    each clause, the requirements are media-independent, as far as possible. The informative
    checklists found in Annexes A and B may be used at each phase of the documentation
    process to verify that the appropriate steps have been carried out, and that the
    finished product has acceptable quality.\nISO/IEC 26513:2009 can be helpful for
    testing and reviewing the following types of documentation:\n- documentation of
    products other than software, for example, hardware or devices;\n- multimedia
    systems using animation, video, and sound;\n- computer-based training (CBT) packages
    and specialized course materials intended primarily for use in formal training
    programs;\n- documentation produced for installers, computer operators, or system
    administrators who are not end users;\n- maintenance documentation describing
    the internal operation of systems software.\nISO/IEC 26513:2009 is applicable
    to testers, reviewers, and other related roles, including a variety of specialists:\n-
    usability testers, documentation reviewers, and subject-matter experts;\n- information
    designers and architects who plan the structure and format of products in a documentation
    set;\n- usability specialists and business analysts who identify the tasks the
    intended users will perform with the software.\nIt can also be consulted by those
    with other roles and interests in the documentation process. \nManagers of the
    software development process or the documentation process should consider the
    testing of documentation as part of their planning and management activities.
    Project managers, in particular, have an important role in planning the testing
    and reviewing of documentation.\nTesting of the documentation is likely to highlight
    any defects or nonconformances in tools that are used to create or display on-screen
    documentation. Similarly, usability testing of the documentation is likely to
    highlight defects or nonconformances with the presentation or layout of documentation
    and associated graphics and other media. As a result, there are a number of roles
    that should be involved in the testing of documentation because their work affects
    the content, display or presentation of documentation for the user, for example,
    developers of tools for creating on-screen documentation, graphic designers producing
    material displayed as part of the documentation, and human-factors experts who
    identify principles for making documentation more accessible and easily used,
    also user interface designers and ergonomics experts working together to design
    the presentation of the documentation on-screen. In some organizations these roles
    may have different titles, or an individual may perform more than one of these
    roles.\nThere are other roles that need to understand the test processes for the
    documentation, for example authors should understand the test processed for the
    documentation that they have produced, and acquirers of documentation prepared
    by another department or organization, might want to know what testing has been
    performed and the processes followed for the documentation that they are acquiring
    from a supplier.\nISO/IEC 26513:2009 is intended for use in all types of organizations,
    whether or not a dedicated documentation department is present. In all cases,
    it may be used as a basis for local standards and procedures. Readers are assumed
    to have experience or general knowledge of testing or reviewing processes.\nISO/IEC
    26513:2009 deals with the evaluation of documentation only, and not with the evaluation
    of the software it supports. Documentation is also included in evaluation of the
    software product, as in the ISO/IEC 25000 series of standards, in particular,
    ISO/IEC 25051:2006 Software engineering — Software product Quality Requirements
    and Evaluation (SQuaRE) — Requirements for quality of Commercial-Off-The-Shelf
    (COTS) software product and instructions for testing."
