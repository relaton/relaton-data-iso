    ISO/ASTM 15900 covers the minimum requirements for dosimetry and absorbed-dose validation needed to conduct research on the irradiation of food and agricultural products. Such research includes establishment of the quantitative relationship between the absorbed dose and the relevant effects in these products. This International Standard also describes the overall need for dosimetry in such research, and in the reporting of results.
    ISO/ASTM 15900 is intended for use by research scientists in the food and agricultural communities and not just scientists conducting irradiation research. It therefore includes more tutorial information than most other ASTM and ISO/ASTM dosimetry standards for radiation processing.
    It is in no way intended to limit the flexibility of the experimenter in the experimental design. However, the radiation source and experimental set-up should be chosen such that the results of the experiment will be beneficial and understandable to other scientists, regulatory agencies, and the food and agricultural communities. This International Standard covers research conducted using the following types of ionizing radiation: gamma rays, bremsstrahlung X-rays and electron beams but does not include other aspects of radiation processing research, such as planning of the experimental design.
