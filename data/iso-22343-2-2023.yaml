    This document gives guidance on the selection, installation and use of vehicle security barrier (VSBs) and describes the process of producing operational requirements (ORs).
    It also gives guidance on a design method for assessing the performance of a VSB.
    This document is applicable to end users, such as site owners and specifiers, of VSBs, where they are used to protect people in any public or private location from vehicle attacks.
    This document does not apply to the performance of a VSB or its control apparatus when subjected to:
    —    slow speed encroachment;
    —    slow speed nudging and ramming;
    —    blast explosion;
    —    ballistic impact;
    —    manual attack, with the aid of the vehicle (multiple impacts at slow speed);
    —    manual attack, with the aid of tools (excluding vehicles);
    —    electrical manipulation;
    —    attack on the control systems by any means.
    NOTE 1   For manual attack, a variety of test methods exist. For assessing intruder resistance of building components, see LPS 1175[53].
    NOTE 2   The VSB is designed and tested on the basis of:
    a)     vehicle type, mass and speed of the assessed vehicle-borne threat;
    b)     its geographical application (e.g. climate conditions);
    c)     intended site location (e.g. rigid or non-rigid soil/finished surface (paving, cobblestone, granite, asphalt).
    It does not apply to guidance on design, the operational suitability of a VSB or other impact test methods.
