    ISO 19224:2017 deals with safety requirements for continuous surface miners (CSM). It specifies common requirements for the design and construction of CSM  to protect workers from accidents and health hazards that can occur during operation, loading, transport and maintenance.
    ISO 19224:2017 deals with known significant hazards, hazardous situations or hazardous events relevant to CSM, when they are used as intended and under conditions of misuse which are reasonably foreseeable by the manufacturer (see Annex A).
    ISO 19224:2017 also specifies the appropriate technical measures to eliminate or reduce risks arising from the significant hazards as identified in Annex A.
    ISO 19224:2017 is not applicable to CSM manufactured before the date of its publication.
