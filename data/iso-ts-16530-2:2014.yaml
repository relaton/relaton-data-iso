    ISO/TS 16530-2:2014 provides requirements and methods to the oil and gas industry to manage well integrity during the well operational phase.
    The operational phase is considered to extend from handover of the well after construction, to handover prior to abandonment. This represents only the period during the life cycle of the well when it is being operated.
    ISO/TS 16530-2:2014 includes:
    ?   A description of the processes required to assess and manage risk within a defined framework. The risk assessment process also applies when deviating from ISO/TS 16530-2:2014.
    ?   The process of managing well integrity by operating wells in compliance with operating limits for all well types that are defined based on exposure of risk to people, environment, assets and reputation. The management of well integrity is supported by associated maintenance/monitoring plans, technical reviews and the management of change.
    ?   The assessment of existing assets (wells / fields) in order to start the process of Well Integrity Management in accordance with ISO/TS 16530-2:2014.
    ?   The handover process required when changing from one activity to another during the operational phase.
    ISO/TS 16530-2:2014 applies to all wells that are utilized by the oil and gas industry, regardless of their age, type or location.
