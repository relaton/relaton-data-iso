  content: Describes a method applicable to products having water contents equal to
    or greater than 0,05 % (m/m). The principle of determination is based on the reaction
    of water with a solution of iodine and sulphur dioxide in a pyridine-methanol
    mixture (Karl Fischer reagent) which is standardized previously by titration of
    an exactly known mass of water. The end point of the reaction is then determined
    by means of the direct electrometric method.
