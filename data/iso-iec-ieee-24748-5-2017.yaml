abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC/IEEE 24748-5:2017 provides a common framework for planning and
    controlling the technical processes and activities to produce and sustain software
    products. The complete life cycle is covered by this document, from idea conception
    to the retirement of a software product. The framework described by this document
    provides for best practices in communication and cooperation among parties that
    plan for, develop, utilize, and manage modern software.\nISO/IEC/IEEE 24748-5:2017:\n-
    \     specifies the required information items to be produced through the implementation
    of the required planning and control processes;\n-       specifies the required
    content of the required information items; \n-       gives guidelines for the
    format and content of the required and related information items; and\n-       details
    the processes necessary to develop and implement a software plan.\nISO/IEC/IEEE
    24748-5:2017  is intended to provide guidance for parties involved in the planning
    of software engineering at all stages of the software life cycle. It is intended
    to provide a common framework for two-party and multi-party collaborations and
    can be applied where the parties are from the same organization. This document
    can also be used by a single party.\nISO/IEC/IEEE 24748-5:2017  is applicable
    to:\n-     those who use ISO/IEC/IEEE FDIS 12207 on projects dealing with software
    products and services related to those products;\n-       those who are responsible
    for the technical management of the development of software systems;\n-       organizations
    and individuals performing software development activities; and\n-       organizations
    and individuals developing information items during the development of software."
