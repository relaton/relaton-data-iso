- content: "This deliverable specifies quality measures for quantitatively measuring
    quality characteristics of sensor data, where these characteristics are specified
    by ISO 8000-210.\nThe following are within the scope of this deliverable:\n—\tfundamental
    principles and assumptions for measuring the quality of sensor data;\n—\tquality
    measures for sensor data, with respect to applicable quality characteristics and
    corresponding data anomalies.\nThe following are outside the scope of this deliverable:\n—\tspecific
    values for each measure, where the value indicates a distinction between, for
    example, good quality and poor quality;\n—\tmethods to improve the quality of
    sensor data."
