abstract:
- content: 'This document provides the basic concepts for IoT systems semantic interoperability,
    as described in the facet model of ISO/IEC 21823-1, including: – requirements
    of the core ontologies for semantic interoperability; – best practices and guidance
    on how to use ontologies and to develop domain-specific applications, including
    the need to allow for extensibility and connection to external ontologies; – cross-domain
    specification and formalization of ontologies to provide harmonized utilization
    of existing ontologies; – relevant IoT ontologies along with comparative study
    of the characteristics and approaches in terms of modularity, extensibility, reusability,
    scalability, interoperability with upper ontologies, and so on, and; – use cases
    and service scenarios that exhibit necessities and requirements of semantic interoperability.'
