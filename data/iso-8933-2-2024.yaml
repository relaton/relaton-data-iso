    This document specifies generic measuring and calculation methods to evaluate the energy efficiency of multiple components connected in a functional system installed on board ships, vessels for inland navigation and offshore structures.
    A maritime functional system consists of multiple components integrating multiple functions, working together to achieve an overall goal.
    The purpose of this document is to show how the energy efficiency of various functional systems correspond to the other installations on board of same functionality, thus ensuring that efficient design is rewarded.
    Maritime systems are grouped according to their functionality, to compare the energy efficiency of functional systems which can fulfil the same task on board a ship.
    This document is applicable to only the functional systems for which a unit output can be clearly defined, and which require energy to function.
    This document is applicable to energy consuming functional systems. It does not provide a life cycle assessment (LCA).
    NOTE            An LCA can prove useful when considering systems which consume substances, and which would not meet the functional requirements without the use of these substances. An example is a ballast water management system (BWMS) using active substances (these types are not considered in this document).
    This document is applicable to the following five types of functional systems:
    a)       pressure and flow;
    b)       lighting;
    c)        heating and cooling;
    d)       mechanical;
    e)       propulsion.
