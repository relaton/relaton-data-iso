- content: |-
    ISO 13185-2:2015 specifies the requirements of an ASN.1-based protocol between a vehicle-ITS-Station Gateway (V-ITS-SG) and a nomadic and/or mobile device (ND) to easily exchange vehicle information data.
    The ASN.1-based protocol has been specified to support a wired or wireless connection between the ND and V-ITS-SG.
    The Unified Gateway Protocol (UGP) is used between the V-ITS-SG and the ND. UGP supports several features in order to provide
    ·         authorization (data privacy),
    ·         secured access,
    ·         V-ITS-SG and in-vehicle ECUs identification,
    ·         real-time vehicle data parameters with identifier and type information in ASN.1 format, and
    ·         enhanced vehicle data parameters with identifier and type information in ASN.1 format.
