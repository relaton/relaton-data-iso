abstract:
- content: This international standard (NWIP) provides details and associated requirements
    for tools, techniques, and analyses required to identify launch windows and associated
    closure times for Safety Launch Collision Avoidance (LCOLA) and (in an informative
    annex) Mission Assurance LCOLA.  The methods evaluate the estimated close approach
    distances and corresponding collision probabilities between the set of all launch
    system and deployed objects, and the set of all on-orbit objects.
