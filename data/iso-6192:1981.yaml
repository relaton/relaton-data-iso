abstract:
- content: Covers a method applicable to products having ammonia contents greater
    than 0,25 mg/kg. Consists in absorbing the ammonia from a gaseous sample in sulphiric
    acid medium with the formation of ammonium sulphate and passing a current of nitrogen
    into the absorption liquid to remove hydrogen sulphide which would interfere.
    This is followed by formation in an alkaline medium of the indophenol complex
    by reaction of the ammonium ions with phenol and hypochlorite ions in the presence
    of sodium pentacyanonitrosoferrate(III) as catalyst, and photomeric measurement
    of the blue coloration obtained at a wavelength of about 625 nm.
