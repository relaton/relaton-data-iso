    ISO 4997:2007 applies to cold-reduced steel sheet of structural quality in grades CR220, CR250, CR320 and CH550, usually without the use of microalloying elements. The product is intended for structures that may include bolting, riveting and welding. It is generally used in the delivered condition for fabricating purposes, such as bending, forming or welding.
    ISO 4997:2007 does not cover steels designated as commercial quality or drawing qualities (covered in ISO 3574:1999), cold-reduced carbon steel sheet according to hardness requirements (covered in ISO 5954:1998), cold-reduced steel sheet of higher strength with improved formability (covered in ISO 13887:2004), or cold-reduced steel sheet of high tensile strength and low yield point with improved formability (covered in ISO 14590:2005).
