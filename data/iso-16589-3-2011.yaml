    ISO 16589 specifies seals utilizing sealing elements manufactured from suitably formulated compounds, based on thermoplastic materials, such as polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE). They are considered suitable for use under low-pressure conditions.
    ISO 16589-3:2011 gives users of lip-type seals guidance on the careful storage and handling and proper installation of rotary shaft lip-type seals; attention is drawn to the hazards involved and ways of avoiding them are pointed out.
