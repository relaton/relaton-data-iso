    ISO/TS 19091:2017 defines the message, data structures, and data elements to support exchanges between the roadside equipment and vehicles to address applications to improve safety, mobility and environmental efficiency. In order to verify that the defined messages will satisfy these applications, a systems engineering process has been employed that traces use cases to requirements and requirements to messages and data concepts.
    This document consists of a single document that contains the base specification and a series of annexes. The base specification lists the derived information requirements (labelled informative) and references to other standards for message definitions where available. Annex A contains descriptions of the use cases addressed by this document. Annex B and Annex C contain traceability matrices that relate use cases to requirements and requirements to the message definitions (i.e. data frames and data elements). The next annexes list the base message requirements and application-oriented specific requirements (requirements traceability matrix) that map to the message and data concepts to be implemented. As such, an implementation consists of the base plus an additional group of extensions within this document.
    Details on information requirements, for other than SPaT, MAP, SSM, and SRM messages are provided in other International Standards. The focus of this document is to specify the details of the SPaT, MAP, SSM, and SRM supporting the use cases defined in this document. Adoption of these messages varies by region and their adoption may occur over a significant time period.
    ISO/TS 19091:2017 covers the interface between roadside equipment and vehicles. Applications, their internal algorithms, and the logical distribution of application functionality over any specific system architecture are outside the scope of this document.
