    ISO 16745:2015 provides requirements for determining and reporting a carbon metric of an existing building, associated with the operation of the building. It sets out methods for the calculation, reporting, communication, and verification of a set of carbon metrics for GHG emissions arising from the measured energy use during the operation of an existing building, the measured user-related energy use, and other relevant GHG emissions and removals. These carbon metrics are separated into three measures designated CM1, CM2, and CM3.
    ISO 16745:2015 follows the principles set out in ISO 15392 and those described in Clause 4 of the Standard. Where deviations from the principles in ISO 15392 occur, or where more specific principles are stated, ISO 16745:2015 takes precedence.
    The carbon metrics CM1 and CM2 are not quantified based on life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology. Carbon metric CM3 may include partial quantification based on the results of LCA.
    ISO 16745:2015 does not include any method of modelling of the operational energy use of the building but follows the conventions provided by other International Standards, as given in relevant clauses.
    ISO 16745:2015 is not an assessment method for evaluating the overall environmental performance of a building or a building-rating tool and does not include value-based interpretation of the carbon metric(s) through weightings or benchmarking.
    ISO 16745:2015 deals with the application of the carbon metric(s) for an existing building, either residential or commercial, or a building complex. It does not include provisions for regional and/or national building stock.
