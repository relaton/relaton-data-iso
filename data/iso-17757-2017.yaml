abstract:
- content: |-
    ISO 17757 provides safety requirements for autonomous machines and semi-autonomous machines used in earth-moving and mining operations, and their autonomous or semi-autonomous machine systems (ASAMS). It specifies safety criteria both for the machines and their associated systems and infrastructure, including hardware and software, and provides guidance on safe use in their defined functional environments during the machine and system life cycle. It also defines terms and definitions related to ASAMS.
    It is applicable to autonomous and semi-autonomous versions of the earth-moving machinery (EMM) defined in ISO 6165 and of mobile mining machines used in either surface or underground applications. Its principles and many of its provisions can be applied to other types of autonomous or semi‑autonomous machines used on the worksites.
    Safety requirements for general mobile EMM and mining machines, as well as operators, trainers or passengers on the machine, are given by other International Standards (e.g. ISO 20474, ISO 19296). ISO 17757 addresses additional hazards specific and relevant to ASAMS when used as intended.
    It is not applicable to remote control capability (covered by ISO 15817) or function-specific automated features, except when those features are used as part of ASAMS.
