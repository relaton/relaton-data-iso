    ISO 12648:2002 applies to printing press systems, including auxiliary equipment and finishing machines, in which all the machine actuators (e.g. drives) of the equipment in the system are controlled by the same control system.
    It is applicable only to systems in which a printing press is part of the system. In cases where a binding/finishing system is not integrated with a printing press, ISO 12649 will apply.
    ISO 12648:2002 provides safety requirements for the design and construction of the classes of machines listed in Clause 2. It addresses recognized hazards specific to printing press systems in the following areas:
    ISO 12648:2002 applies to new machines (see Clause 2) manufactured after December 31 of the year following the year of publication of this standard.
