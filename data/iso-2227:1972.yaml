  content: The specified method is applicable to HCHO contents between 25 5 and 45
    %. The field of application may be extended by siutably modifying the mass of
    the test portion. The principle consists in the reaction of the test solution
    with a neutral sodium sulphite solution, and acidimetric titration of the liberated
    sodium hydroxide in presence of thymolphthalein as indicator.
