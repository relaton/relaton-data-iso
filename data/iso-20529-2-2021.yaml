abstract:
- content: |-
    This document provides information and requirements for identifying cost-effective technologies and related standards required to deploy, manage and operate sustainable “green” ITS technologies in surface transportations with eco-mobility. These ITS technologies can increase operational efficiencies and unlock enhanced transportation safety and eco-mobility applications.
    The ISO 20529 series builds on the existing standards and best practices of transport operation and management systems, as well as ITS applications, and aims to accommodate the specific needs of eco-mobility.
    G-ITS standards are expected to focus on the use of data exchange interface standards to enable the deployment of cloud-based multi-modal mobility solutions using wireless networks and nomadic devices. These forward-looking solutions are “infrastructure light” and can thus impact developing regions with little or no legacy transportation infrastructure.
    This document is intended to provide mobility information according to user preference on demand, utilizing a variety of existing apps on nomadic devices related to various means of transport. An integrated mobility information platform is defined in this document as a service methodology to be integrated with a variety of mobile apps with respect to different modes of transport.
    The framework described in this document includes:
    —    Identification of implementation aspects of related standards by means of use case.
    —    Identification of the multi-modal transport information necessary to support G-ITS.
    —    Eco-friendly route guidance according to user preference.
    —    Smart modal choice service based on carbon footprint, fuel efficiency and carbon-free zones for G-ITS.
