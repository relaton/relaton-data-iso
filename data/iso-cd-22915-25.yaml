  content: "This part of ISO 22915 specifies static tests for verifying the stability
    of rough-terrain variable-reach trucks (hereafter referred to as non-slewing trucks)
    and slewing rough-terrain variable-reach trucks (hereafter referred to as slewing
    trucks) as defined in ISO 5053-1, operating in the special condition of handling
    freely suspended loads. \n\nThis document covers trucks fitted with a lifting
    attachment or lifting point when used in the following applications:\n-\tpicking
    and placing loads (stationary operation) on substantially firm, smooth, level,
    and prepared surfaces\n-\ttravelling with load on unimproved natural terrain and
    disturbed-terrain with slopes not exceeding limits determined by the manufacturer,
    at travel speeds not exceeding 1.4 km/h and with boom angle and extension not
    exceeding manufacturers limits\nThis document does not deal with hazards that
    could occur due to:\n-\taction of the wind;\n-\tdynamic motion of the load.\nNote:
    A tag line or a tether can be used to restrain the dynamic effects of the load
    during travel.\n\nIt is not applicable to those trucks:\n-\tdesigned for handling
    freight containers;\n-\twith an articulating chassis;\n-\tequipped with integrated
    and non-integrated personnel work platforms."
