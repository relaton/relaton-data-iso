    This document specifies general safety requirements for non-slewing, rough-terrain variable-reach trucks (referred to as trucks), with rigid chassis and equipped with a telescopic lifting means (pivoting boom) on which a load-handling device such as a carriage with fork arms is typically fitted. Fork arms and other integrated attachments are considered to be parts of the truck.
    NOTE    These trucks are also known as telehandlers, or telescopic handlers.
    For the purpose of this document, trucks are designed to transport, lift and place loads and can be driven on unimproved terrain. They can also be equipped with a variety of attachments or interchangeable equipment (e.g. fork arms, bale spikes, mowers, sweepers) which can be both load-carrying and non-load-carrying.
    Other standards, in addition to the relevant provisions of this document, can apply to the attachments.
    This document is not applicable to the following:
    a)   industrial variable-reach trucks covered by ISO 3691-2;
    b)   machines designed primarily for earth moving, such as loaders, even if their buckets are replaced by fork arms (see ISO 20474-3);
    c)   trucks with articulated chassis;
    d)   machines designed primarily with variable-length load suspension elements (e.g. chain, ropes) from which the load can swing freely in all directions (mobile cranes);
    e)   trucks fitted with personnel/work platforms, designed to move persons to elevated working positions;
    f)    trucks designed primarily for container handling.
    The significant hazards covered by this document are listed in Annex A. This document does not address hazards that can occur:
    —     during manufacture;
    —     when handling suspended loads, which can swing freely (see ISO 10896-4);
    —     when using trucks on public roads;
    —     when operating in potentially explosive atmospheres;
    —     with a battery, LPG or hybrid as the primary power source.
