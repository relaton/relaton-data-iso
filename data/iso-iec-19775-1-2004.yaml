  content: "ISO/IEC 19775-1:2004 defines the architecture and base components of X3D.
    ISO/IEC 19775, X3D, defines a software system that integrates network-enabled
    3D graphics and multimedia. Conceptually, each X3D application is a 3D time-based
    space that contains graphic and aural objects that can be dynamically modified
    through a variety of mechanisms.\nThe semantics of X3D describe an abstract functional
    behaviour of time-based, interactive 3D, multimedia information. ISO/IEC 19775-1:2004
    does not define physical devices or any other implementation-dependent concepts
    (e.g. screen resolution and input devices). ISO/IEC 19775-1:2004 is intended for
    a wide variety of devices and applications, and provides wide latitude in interpretation
    and implementation of the functionality. For example, ISO/IEC 19775-1:2004 does
    not assume the existence of a mouse or 2D display device.\nEach X3D application:\n-
    implicitly establishes a world coordinate space for all objects defined, as well
    as all objects included by the application; \n- explicitly defines and composes
    a set of 3D and multimedia objects; \n- can specify hyperlinks to other files
    and applications; \n- can define programmatic or data-driven object behaviours;
    \n- can connect to external modules or applications via programming and scripting
    languages; \n- explicitly declares its functional requirements by specifying a
    profile; \n- can declare additional functional requirements by specifying components. "
