abstract:
- content: The Standard gives detailed information on all recurrent parameters, apparatus,
    products, methods and formulae for the analysis. The method consists in analyzing
    a small quantity of essential oil on a column of small diameter but great length,
    the inside wall of the column having been previously coated either directly with
    a specified stationary phase or with an impregnated support. If required different
    constituents are identified from their retention indexes. Quantitative determination
    of specific constituents is carried out by measurement of peak areas.
