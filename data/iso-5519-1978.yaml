  content: The method consists in homogenizing the product, followed by quantitative
    entraining, by steam, of the acid present in a test portion, determination of
    the acid in the destillate obtained, either by spectrophotometry in the ultra-violet
    range (technique A) or by measuring by photocolorimetry or by spectrophotometry
    the pink colour obtained after oxidation by chromic acid and then treatment with
    thiobarbituric acid (technique B).
