  content: "ISO/TS 14907-1:2015 specifies the test procedures of EFC roadside equipment
    (RSE) and on-board equipment (OBE) with regard to the conformance to standards
    and requirements for type approval and acceptance testing which is within the
    realm of EFC application specifically.\nISO/TS 14907-1:2015 is restricted to systems
    operating within the radio emission, electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) regulations,
    traffic, and other regulations of the countries in which they are operated.\nISO/TS
    14907-1:2015 identifies a set of suitable parameters and provides test procedures
    to enable the proof of a complete EFC system, as well as components of an EFC
    system, e.g. OBE, related to the defined requirements of an application. The defined
    parameter and tests are assigned to the following groups of parameters:\n?   functionality;\n?
    \  quality;\n?   referenced pre-tests.\nAn overview of the tests and parameters
    provided by this part of ISO/TS 14907 is given in 5.1 and 5.2. \nISO/TS 14907-1:2015
    describes procedures, methods and tools, and a test plan which shows the relation
    between all tests and the sequence of these tests. It lists all tests that are
    required to measure the performance of EFC equipment. It describes which EFC equipment
    is covered by the test procedures; the values of the parameters to be tested are
    not included. It also describes how the tests are to be performed and which tools
    and prerequisites are necessary before this series of tests can be undertaken.
    It is assumed that the security of the system is inherent in the communications
    and EFC functionality tests, therefore they are not addressed here. All tests
    in this part of ISO/TS 14907 provide instructions to evaluate the test results."
