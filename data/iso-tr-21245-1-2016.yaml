  content: ISO/TR 21245-1:2016 aims to identify typical stakeholders of rail projects
    and their generic needs/interests and does not interfere with existing national
    and local laws, legal requirements and regulations. It covers only the planning
    stage of rail projects and does not cover the execution stage. Any type of rail
    project is included (building a new line, retrofitting or upgrading existing lines
    or changes of operation or maintenance). In ISO/TR 21245-1:2016, needs/interests
    of stakeholders are dealt with as issues, which are subject to modification or
    change by all stakeholders concerned in the project.
