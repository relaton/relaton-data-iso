    The Storage Management Technical Specification, Part 6 Fabric defines management profiles for Autonomous (top level) profiles for programs and devices whose central function is providing support for storage networking. This version of Storage Management Technical Specification, Part 6 Fabric includes these autonomous profiles:
    - FabricThis profile defines the model and functions of a storage network including topology and zoning control.
    - SwitchThis profile defines the model and functions of a Fibre Channel Switch including state, status, and control of the device and it’s connections and product information,
    - ExtenderThis profile defines the model and functions of a networking device that allows for fibre channel to be extended over other networks, and specifically over IP (FCIP).
