abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: Describes a method that is more sensitive and more widely used than the
    2,2'-bipyridyl method. It is applicable to products having iron contents equal
    to or greater than 0.3 mg/kg. The principle is based on the reduction of iron(III)
    by hydroxylammonium chloride, formation of a iron(II)/1,10-phenanthroline complex
    in a buffered system. Photometric measurement of the coloured complex at a wavelength
    of about 510 nm. - Cancels and replaces ISO Recommendation R 994-1969.
