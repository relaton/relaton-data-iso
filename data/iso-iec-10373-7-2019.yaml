    The ISO/IEC 10373 series defines test methods for characteristics of identification cards according to the definition given in ISO/IEC 7810. Each test method is cross‑referenced to one or more base standards, which can be ISO/IEC 7810 or one or more of the supplementary standards that define the information storage technologies employed in identification card applications.
    NOTE 1  Criteria for acceptability do not form part of the ISO/IEC 10373 series, but can be found in the International Standards mentioned above.
    NOTE 2  Test methods defined in the ISO/IEC 10373 series are intended to be performed separately. A given card is not required to pass through all the tests sequentially.
    This document deals with test methods, which are specific to contactless integrated circuit card (vicinity card) technology. ISO/IEC 10373-1 deals with test methods which are common to one or more ICC technologies and other parts in the ISO/IEC 10373 series deal with other technology‑specific tests.
    Unless otherwise specified, the tests in this document apply exclusively to vicinity cards defined in ISO/IEC 15693‑1, ISO/IEC 15693-2 and ISO/IEC 15693-3.
