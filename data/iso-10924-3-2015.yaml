    ISO 10924-3:2015 specifies miniature circuit breakers with tabs (blade-type), Form CB11 for use in road vehicles. It establishes, for this circuit breaker form, the rated current, test procedures, performance requirements and dimensions.
    ISO 10924-3:2015 is intended to be used in conjunction with ISO 10924‑1 and with ISO 10924‑2. The numbering of its clauses corresponds to that of ISO 10924‑1 whose requirements are applicable, except where modified by requirements particular to this part of ISO 10924.
    ISO 10924-3:2015 is applicable to circuit breakers with a rated voltage of 14 V and/or 28 V, a current rating of ≤30 A and a breaking capacity of 2 000 A intended for use in road vehicles with a nominal voltage of 12 V and/or 24 V.
    The circuit breakers are different in dimensions and functions, such as electrically reset, automatic reset, manual reset, and switchable.
    NOTE          This type of circuit breaker is intended to be used in similar applications as miniature fuse-links according to ISO 8820‑3. While the tab dimensions and current ratings can be the same, there might be differences in performance which the user of these products is advised to consider.
