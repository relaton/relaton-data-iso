  content: "ISO 15673:2016 provides guidelines for the design and construction of
    low-rise concrete building structures of small area to be built in the less developed
    areas of the world. \nISO 15673:2016 is applicable to the planning, design and
    construction of structural reinforced concrete structures to be used in new low-rise
    buildings of restricted occupancy, number of stories, and area. \nISO 15673:2016
    can be used as an alternative to the development of a National Concrete Building
    Code, or equivalent document in countries where no national design codes are available
    by themselves, or as an alternative to the National Concrete Building Code in
    countries where specifically considered and accepted by the national standard
    body or other appropriate regulatory organization."
