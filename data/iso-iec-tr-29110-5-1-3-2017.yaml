    ISO/IEC TR 29110-5-1-3:2017 provides management and engineering guide to the intermediate profile described in terms of business management, project management, software implementation and acquisition processes.
    ISO/IEC TR 29110-5-1-3:2017 is applicable to Very Small Entities (VSEs). VSEs are enterprises, organizations, departments or projects having up to 25 people. The life cycle processes described in the ISO/IEC 29110 series are not intended to preclude or discourage their use by organizations bigger than VSEs.
    ISO/IEC 29110?4-1 identifies the requirements applicable to the tasks and work products described in this document.
    ISO/IEC TR 29110-5-1-3:2017 has been developed using the management and engineering guide of the Basic profile and by modifying and adding elements (e.g. process, task, work product, role) for VSEs involved in the development of more than one project in parallel with more than one work team.
    ISO/IEC TR 29110-5-1-3:2017 applies for VSEs developing non-critical software.
    Using this document, VSEs can obtain the following benefits:
    -      the management and monitoring of more than one project in parallel with more than one work team;
    -      reuse existing software components (e.g. code and document) in new projects;
    -      continuously measure projects and improve processes.
    Once the software, developed by a VSE, has been accepted by their customers, the VSE that wants to provide after delivery services can refer to ISO/IEC TR 29110-5-3.[1]
    ISO/IEC TR 29110-5-1-3:2017 is targeted to VSEs which are familiar with ISO/IEC TR 29110‑5-1-2 for their software development projects and are involved in the development of more than one project in parallel with more than one work team.
    ISO/IEC TR 29110-5-1-3:2017 is intended to be used with any lifecycles, processes, techniques and methods that enhance the VSEs customer satisfaction and productivity.
