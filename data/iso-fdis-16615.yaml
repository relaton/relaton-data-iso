    Satellite attitude and orbit control system (AOCS) is responsible for completing the attitude and orbit control of the satellite. It is essential for ensuring the basic functions and stable operation of the satellite.

    This standard specifies the definition of on-orbit stable operation of the satellite AOCS. According to the influencing factors of the satellite on-orbit stable operation, it specifies the principles and requirements for the construction of the satellite AOCS on-orbit stable operation capability, Including the judgment principles and processing requirements of data validity judgment, anomaly detection, soft/hard failure handling, safety boundary detection, emergency safety mode, etc. At the same time, this standard regulates the functional interface between on-orbit autonomy and ground maintenance to ensure that the satellite flies in the expected attitude and orbit, and when the control system itself is abnormal or other unexpected faults occur in the orbit, the AOCS has the ability to maintain as much as possible. Or the ability to restore a continuous and stable operating state, even in the worst case, try not to cause damage to the satellite structure or endanger energy and fuel security due to the instability of the control system attitude. When the components of the attitude and orbit control system are abnormal or other unexpected failures occur in orbit, AOCS has the ability to maintain or restore a continuous and stable operation state as much as possible, by autonomous capability or ground support. Even in the worst case, AOCS tries not to cause damage to the satellite structure or endanger energy/fuel safety.

    This standard applies to the attitude and orbit control systems of various satellites.
