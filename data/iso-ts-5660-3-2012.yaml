    ISO/TS 5660-3:2012 examines the measurement limitations and applications of the cone calorimeter data as currently used for building products, and recommends ways in which some of these may be overcome for other types of products for other application areas. It compiles information from a large body of experience with regard to the use of the instrument. This information is presented as a set of guidelines, which will help to standardize the use of the cone calorimeter in this wider scope.
    Particular guidance is given on aspects of specimen preparation and on the behaviour, such as melting, spalling and intumescing, of specimens exposed to radiant heat. The relevance of specimen thickness and the use of substrate, and methods of fixing to substrate, are also discussed. Advice is given on approaches to testing a variety of "non-standard" products. Recommendations are made on techniques of calibration of the apparatus, selection of appropriate heat flux levels and ignition protocols.
