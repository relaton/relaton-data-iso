    This document specifies requirements and recommendations for performance assessment methods for superhydrophobic surfaces and coatings subjected to mechanical stress, solar radiation and weathering, liquids, and thermal cycling, where applicable, based on the agreement between interested parties. The performance assessment is carried out based on comparative measurements of the advancing and receding angles and the calculation of the contact angle hysteresis before and after the above-mentioned working/environmental conditions. This document does not address safety and environmental related issues of such coatings.
    This document is applicable to any superhydrophobic surfaces and coatings (i.e. nanostructured) on which the measurement of the advancing and receding angles is possible.
