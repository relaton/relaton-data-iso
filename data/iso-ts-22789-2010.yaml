abstract:
- content: |-
    The purpose of ISO/TS 22789:2010 is to specify a categorial structure, within the subject field of patient findings and problems, by defining a set of common domain constraints for use within terminological systems including a classification, coding scheme, coding system, reference terminology and clinical terminology.
    Clinical findings are concepts that are recorded in clinical records and can describe any state observed directly or indirectly concerning a patient and their relationship with the environment. ISO/TS 22789:2010 is focused on a sub-population of these findings concerning in vivo descriptions of state (structure and function) directly related to the patient.
    ISO/TS 22789:2010 describes a concept system detailing a domain constraint of sanctioned characteristics each composed of a semantic link and an applicable characterizing category.
