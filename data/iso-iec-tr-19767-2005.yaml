- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: ISO/IEC TR 19767:2004 specifies an extension to the module facilities and
    the syntax of definition of procedures in the programming language Fortran. The
    Fortran language is specified by ISO/IEC 1539-1:2004. The extension allows program
    authors to develop the implementation details of concepts in new program units,
    called "submodules," that cannot be accessed directly by use association, and
    to define the interface and implementation of procedures separately. The module
    facility and the syntax of definition of procedures in ISO/IEC 1539-1:2004 are
    changed by this Technical Report in such a way as to be upwardly compatible with
    ISO/IEC 1539-1:2004.
