  content: Specifies the requirements for the design, manufacture and testing. Also
    specifies nominal sizes from DN 6 to DN 300, nominal pressures from PN 2,5 to
    PN 250, two types of construction and two types of flexibility of hose assembly.
    The corrugated hose assemblies specified are suitable for the majority of possible
    applications. They are however not designed for applications involving axial compression
    or extension, or external pressure.
