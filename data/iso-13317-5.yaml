abstract:
- content: "This part of ISO 13317 describes and principles and proper use of gravitational
    photosedimentation techniques for the characterisation of dispersed phases of
    suspensions and emulsions. These techniques monitor the gravity-induced phase
    separation of particulate materials dispersed in liquids by recording photometric
    signals (i.e., intensity of transmitted or scattered light) as function of vertical
    position and/or measurement time. Recorded signals reflect the changes in local
    particle concentration due to sedimentation and can be easily transformed to distributions
    of sedimentation velocity. This computation does not demand essential preconditions
    and theoretical assumptions. The conversion of velocity into particle size (Stokes
    diameter) relies on the applicability of Stokes’ law. As fractionating technique,
    sedimentation analysis facilitates to distinguish between particle fractions of
    close sedimentation velocity. Accordingly, particle size distributions can be
    very finely resolved, which is an advantage compared to spectroscopic ensemble
    techniques. The measured distribution functions are intrinsically weighted by
    photometric quantities (e.g. light extinction or scattered light intensity). Yet,
    they are frequently converted into volume or number-weighted distribution functions
    by employing established models for light-particle interaction. \nGravitational
    photosedimentation facilitates the granulometric characterisation of dispersed
    materials of non-zero density contrast to the continuous phase, incl. solid particles
    and emulsion droplets. The available measurement range depends on dispersed and
    continuous phase properties and typically amounts to 200 nm – 100 μm for aqueous
    samples, whereas sedimentation velocity can be quantified for the range 0,6 µm/s
    – 10 mm/s. Also, the working range with regard to particle concentration is strongly
    affected by material properties and by particle size, yet it is typically well
    below 1 vol%. The data analysis relies on the assumption that all particles have
    the same density and comparable shapes and do not undergo chemical or physical
    change in the continuous phase. \nIn addition, gravity photosedimentation by scanning,
    or time and position resolved extinction allows to characterize the dispersion
    state regarding, e.g. clarification, segregation, agglomeration, consolidation
    and physico-chemical stability. Photosedimentaion is equally applicable to determine
    particle density as well as sediment and cream layer formation. \n\nNOTE. This
    part of ISO 13317 can involve hazardous materials, operations and equipment. This
    part of ISO 13317 does not purport to address all the safety problems associated
    with its use. Explosion proof analysers are required when examining volatile liquids
    with a low flash point.\n \nIt is the responsibility of the user of this part
    of ISO 13317 to establish appropriate safety and health practices and to determine
    the applicability of the regulatory limitations prior to its use."
