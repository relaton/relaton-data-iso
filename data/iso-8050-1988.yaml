abstract:
- content: Applies to ferronickel lots in ingot or piece form with a view to obtaining
    a representative laboratory sample for the determination of the chemical composition
    of the lot. A choice is to be made between a first procedure that can be applied
    at the producer's plant during casting or a second procedure that can be applied
    to lots as delivered at the buyer's premises. Includes two alternatives for sample
    taking (drilling and milling). Each party is entitled to participate in sampling
    operations.
