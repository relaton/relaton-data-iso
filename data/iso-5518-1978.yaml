  content: The method consists in homogenizing the product, followed by dilution and
    acidification of a test portion, extraction of the acid by diethyl ether, then
    alkaline re-extraction of this acid and purifying by oxidation using acidified
    potassium dichromate, determination of the acid with a suitable spectrophotometer.
    The method cannot be applied in the presence of p-chlorobenzoic acid and cinnamic
    acid, respectively.
