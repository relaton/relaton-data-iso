  content: This document specifies a method for the quantitative determination of17
    mycotoxins including aflatoxin B1, aflatoxin B2, aflatoxin G1, aflatoxin G2, deoxynivalenol,
    nivalenol, deoxynivalenol-3- Glucoside, 3-acetyl-deoxynivalenol, 15-acetyl-deoxynivalenol,zearalenone,ochratoxin
    A, fumonisinB1, fumonisinB2, fumonisinB3,T-2 toxin, HT-2 toxin, and sterigmatocystin
    in cereals and cereal products using ultra ultra high performance liquid chromatography
    and tandem mass spectrometry method (UHPLC-MS/MS). The limits of detection and
    quantification in this method are dependent on the instrument and the operational
    parameters.
