    This document specifies a full-scale test method for propeller cavitation observation and hull pressure measurement. The objective of the test is to investigate the propeller cavitation behaviour and its effects on the hull vibration problems.
    The test method comprises the specification of the test instrumentation and implementation, construction requirements to ensure structural safety, test and measurement procedures, and reporting documentation.
    This document is applicable to ships in the following stages:
    —     before or during sea-trial, prior to delivery stage (vessels under constructions), and
    —     after delivery stage.
