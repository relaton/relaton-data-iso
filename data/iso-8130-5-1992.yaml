abstract:
- content: The method specified reflects commercial practice in powder spraying. Its
    principle is placing, under draught-free conditions, a specified quantity of coating
    powder in a vessel and fluidizing it with clean dry air under standard conditions
    of atmospheric temperature and pressure. The height of the powder during and after
    fluidization is measured and the rate at which the fluidized powder flows through
    a specified orifice is then determined. The measurements are used to calculate
    the fluidization factor and the powder flow rate (flow factor) which together
    define the transport and spraying characteristics of the powder.
