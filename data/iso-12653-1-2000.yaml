    This part of ISO 12653 specifies a test target for use in assessing the consistency of quality of performance over
    time of flat-bed and rotary black-and-white reflection scanners used in electronic image management systems. The
    test target is designed:
    a) to allow routine checks of the system's performance;
    b) to establish the performance limits of the system.
    This part of ISO 12653 is applicable to assessing the output quality of black-and-white scanners used for blackand-
    white or colour office documents, with or without half-tone or colour.
    It is not applicable to colour scanners or scanners used for the scanning of transparent or translucent documents.
    NOTE Additional targets for assessing the output quality of black-and-white scanners using continuous tone and colour are
    referred to in ISO 12653-2.
