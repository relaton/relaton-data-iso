    ISO/TR 37121:2016 provides an inventory of existing guidelines and approaches on sustainable development and resilience in cities.
    ISO/TR 37121:2016 focuses on resilience understood as the ability of a city, system, community, local government or society exposed to hazards to resist, absorb, accommodate to and recover from the effects of a hazard in a timely and efficient manner, including through the preservation and restoration of its essential basic structures and functions.
    Resilience indicators are intended to assess the extent to which cities are helping residents, businesses, institutions, and infrastructure resist, absorb, accommodate to and recover from the effects of hazards in a timely and efficient manner.
