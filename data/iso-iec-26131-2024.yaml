abstract:
- content: "OpenID Connect 1.0 is a simple identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0
    protocol. It enables Clients to verify the identity of the End-User based on the
    authentication performed by an Authorization Server, as well as to obtain basic
    profile information about the End-User in an interoperable and REST-like manner.
    \nThis document defines the core OpenID Connect functionality: authentication
    built on top of OAuth 2.0 and the use of Claims to communicate information about
    the End-User. It also describes the security and privacy considerations for using
    OpenID Connect. "
