    IWA 6:2008 is intended to identify and chart the critical elements that are of great significance to drinking water security. Its purpose is to set in motion a continuous process for the establishment of guidelines on management systems for drinking water utilities under crisis conditions.
    IWA 6:2008 provides the guidelines for a water utility, or any body responsible for the management of parts of the water supply system, to be prepared and ready to manage a water crisis. It also provides a roadmap for possible relevant International Standards that could be useful and could be developed.
