abstract:
- content: "This document establishes requirements on implementations that quantify
    how a face image’s properties conform with those of canonical face images, for
    example those specified in ISO/IEC 39794-5:2019, Clause D.1, for three use-cases:
    \n1)       collection of reference samples for ID documents;\n2)       sample
    system enrolment; and \n3)       probes for instantaneous response.\nThis document
    also establishes terms and definitions for quantifying face image quality and
    specifies methods for quantifying the quality of face images.\nThis document does
    not establish requirements on:\n—     assessing the quality of pairs or sequences
    of images;\nNOTE            This document establishes requirements for software
    that inspects exactly one image. This document does not establish requirements
    for software that compares two or more images (such as biometric recognition).
    However, the computations of this document can be applied separately to each image
    in a pair or sequence.\n—     assessing the quality of 3D captures;\n—     encodings
    of face image quality data;\n—     performance evaluation of face image quality
    assessment algorithms.\nThe use cases within scope of this document primarily
    address the assessment of images from data capture subjects who consent to processing
    of their biometric data, or for whom biometric capture is operationally authorized."
