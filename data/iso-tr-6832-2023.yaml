  content: This document describes the technology for simulating space environments
    such as vacuum, cold black, and heat flux, as well as the compositions and functions
    of a thermal vacuum chamber (TVC). This kind of facility defined in this document
    is suitable for thermal vacuum tests (TVT) and thermal balance tests (TBT) on
    spacecraft-system level as well as on large-spacecraft-component level.
