    This document specifies a method for evaluating depositions on real structures and equipment by wiping. Depositions become corrosion and/or degradation factors for metals, alloys and organic materials, and can be analysed quantitatively to control the corrosion and degradation of real structures and equipment.
    The method specified in this document is suitable for evaluating the type and amounts of depositions on real structures and equipment in all industries. This method identifies the type of depositions and gives instantaneous values of the concentrations of water-soluble and insoluble depositions, which are expressed by mass per area without a time component. These values provide information on environmental factors related to corrosion and degradation. The method can be used to detect water-soluble depositions, including chloride ion, sulfate ion and other ions, and can assist users in understanding the synergistic and antagonistic effects that accelerate corrosion.
    This document is applicable to:
    —     metals and their alloys;
    —     metallic coatings;
    —     organic coatings;
    —     concretes and other structural materials.
    The method for determining chloride on clean surfaces, which ensures the cleanness of steel substrates after surface preparation such as grinding, polishing, cleaning and rinsing and before the application of paints, is given in ISO 8502-2, ISO 8502-5, ISO 8502-6 and ISO 8502-9.
