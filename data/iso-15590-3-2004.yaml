    ISO 15590-3:2004 applies to weldneck and blind flanges (full face, raised face, and RTJ groove) as well as anchor, swivel-ring flanges and orifice flanges.
    ISO 15590-3:2004 specifies the technical requirements for carbon steel and low-alloy steel forged flanges for use in pipeline transportation systems for the petroleum and natural gas industries as defined in ISO 13623.
    ISO 15590-3:2004 designates those categories of flanges that meet the industry's need to match ISO 3183 pipe. These flanges are for normal and low-temperature service and include supplementary requirements where required for sour service.
    Materials for, or the attachment of, factory-welded extensions, bolting materials, gaskets, slip-on flanges or flanged fittings are not covered by ISO 15590-3:2004.
    ISO 15590-3:2004 is not applicable to integrally cast or forged flanges for valves, pumps or other equipment.
    ISO 15590-3:2004 does not cover the selection of the flange category or pressure class. Sizes and pressure classes listed in ISO 7005-1 and applicable to ISO 15590-3:2004 are as follows:
    - DN 10 (NPS 1/2) to DN 1500 (NPS 60);
    - PN 20 (class 150), PN 50 (class 300), PN 100 (class 600), PN 150 (class 900), PN 250 (class 1500), PN 420 (class 2500).
