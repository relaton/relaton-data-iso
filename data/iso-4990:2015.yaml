    ISO 4990:2015 specifies the general technical delivery requirements for the supply of steel, nickel, and cobalt alloy castings, including the requirements for the selection and preparation of samples and test pieces.
    When a material or product standard differ from this delivery specification, the material or product standard shall apply. In the case of investment castings, ISO 16468 will apply.
    This International Standard also specifies a group of supplementary requirements which may be applied to steel, nickel, and cobalt alloy castings. These requirements are provided for use when additional testing or inspection is desired and apply only when individually specified by the purchaser.
