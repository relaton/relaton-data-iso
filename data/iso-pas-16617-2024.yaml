abstract:
- content: "This document provides guidance for examining evaluation instruments that
    assess cooking systems. The goal is to ensure that a cooking system evaluation
    instrument achieves its objectives and is fit for a particular purpose. Doing
    so means recognizing that the stove is one part of a series of complex and interacting
    systems, many of which are variable. \nThe document includes procedures to ensure
    that:\n—     an evaluation instrument captures the necessary input measures at
    an appropriate level of detail and quality; \n—     outputs from the evaluation
    instrument are accurate, repeatable, reproducible, and appropriate for assessing
    the stated outcome. \nThe document also provides guidance to interpret the outputs
    of an evaluation instrument when reporting. The document does not specify test
    methods nor recommend pre-determined procedures or benchmarks of performance (also
    known as tiers)."
