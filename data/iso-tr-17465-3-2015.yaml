abstract:
- content: ISO/TR 17465-3:2015 is to provide a description of the release procedures
    for standards that is to be used within ISO TC 204. In the main, these will be
    International Standards produced by ISO TC 204; however, it is likely that some
    standards produced by other Standards Development Organizations will have to be
    included in some releases. Initially, this release procedure will be applied to
    the deployment of standards for cooperative-ITS, however, in principle at least,
    it should be possible to apply it to standards for other ITS domains. It also
    has to be possible for this release procedure to be used by other Standards Development
    Organizations that do not already have their own procedures and with suitable
    changes to the identities of the people and groups involved, by any other organization
    that needs to produce a consistent set of documents.
