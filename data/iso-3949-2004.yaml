    ISO 3949:2004 specifies requirements for two types of textile-reinforced thermoplastics hoses and hose assemblies of nominal bore from 5 to 25. Each type is divided into two classes dependent on electrical-conductivity requirements. They are suitable for use with:
    - hydraulic fluids HH, HL, HM, HR and HV at temperatures ranging from -40 °C to +100 °C;
    - water-based hydraulic fluids HFC, HFAE, HFAS and HFB at temperatures ranging from 0 °C to +60 °C.
    This International Standard does not include requirements for end fittings. It is limited to the performance of hoses and hose assemblies.
