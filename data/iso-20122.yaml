abstract:
- content: "This International standard method specifies a procedure for the determination
    of saturated and aromatic hydrocarbons (from C10 to C50) in vegetable fats and
    oils using the online-coupled HPLC-GC-FID. This standard is not intended to be
    applied to other matrices. \nThe method can be used for the analysis of mineral
    oil saturated hydrocarbons (MOSH) and/or mineral oil aromatic hydrocarbons (MOAH).\nAccording
    to the results of the interlaboratory studies, the method has been proven suitable
    for MOSH mass concentrations above 3 mg/kg and MOAH mass concentrations above
    2 mg/kg.\nIn case of suspected interferences, the fossil origin of the MOSH and
    MOAH fraction can be verified by examination by GC⨯GC-MS.\nAn alternative method
    for the epoxidation of the MOAH fraction (performic acid epoxidation) is proposed
    in Annex C. This alternative method provides comparable results to the ethanolic
    epoxidation of the MOAH fraction described in 8.5. This alternative method for
    epoxidation has proven to be efficient for samples with a high amount of interferences
    in the MOAH fraction (e.g. tropical oils)."
