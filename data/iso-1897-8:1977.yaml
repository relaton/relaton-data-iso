  content: This method is the best available at the present time. It was primarily
    intended for samples containing 40 % (m/m) or more but has been extended to lower
    ranges. The principle is based on dehydration of a quantity of the test sample.
    Formation of a complex between o-cresol and cineole (having a crystallizing point
    not lower than 1,2 °C) by addition of excess cineole to a test portion of the
    dehydrated sample. Determination of the crystallizing point of the complex in
    a crystallizing point apparatus. Calculation of the content from the water content
    of the test sample and the crystallizing point of the complex. The relation between
    crystallizing point and o-cresol content of o-cresol/cineole mixtures is given
    in a table. ISO 1897/8 replaces ISO Recommendation R 1910-1971.
