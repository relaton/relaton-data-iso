abstract:
- content: "This document provides an indication of the lowest age at which children
    start playing with toys in specific toy sub-categories. It is primarily directed
    to manufacturers and agencies that evaluate the compliance of toys with safety
    standards.\nThis document can be used as a reference to determine the appropriateness
    of toys by earliest age, for use by distributors, institutions and organizations
    involved with child play, as well as by paediatric institutions, teachers, other
    professionals that use toys in their routine activities, and consumers.\nThe age
    at which children develop different abilities is unique for each individual child.
    This document illustrates the age ranges during which a typical child has developed
    certain abilities.\nAlthough age grading has safety implications, this document
    is not intended to address specific safety requirements. Specific safety requirements
    for toys (e.g. restriction of the presence of small parts and small balls in toys
    intended for certain age groups, due to the choking hazard) can be found in the
    ISO 8124 series and in other regional toy safety standards and regulations. "
