abstract:
- content: ISO/TR 19480:2005 gives guidance and other provisions for the training,
    assessment and approval of fusion operators, with the aim of establishing and
    maintaining their competency in the construction of polyethylene (PE) piping systems
    for the supply of gaseous fuels in accordance with ISO 10839, for the supply of
    water, or in the construction of such systems used in other pressure applications.
    It covers the butt fusion, electrofusion and socket fusion jointing techniques
    and considers both the theoretical and practical knowledge necessary to enable
    high-quality fusion joints to be produced.
