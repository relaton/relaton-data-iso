- content: |-
    This document specifies a method for determining the pour point of petroleum products by means of automated equipment, in which movement of the test specimen is detected using a step-wise cooling technique.
    A separate procedure suitable for the determination of the lower pour point of fuel oils, heavy lubricant base stock, and products containing residual fuel components is also described.
    The procedure described in this document is not suitable for crude oils.
    Test results from this method are determined in 3 °C testing intervals.
    NOTE       Some equipment can also generate results at 1 °C testing intervals, which is an acceptable alternative procedure, but for which precision and bias have not been determined.
