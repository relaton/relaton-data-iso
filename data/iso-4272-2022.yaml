    This document defines the terms and definitions related to truck platooning systems (TPS), and the mode transitions in the platooning control system (PCS). The PCS is comprised of two main functions: the platooning operation control function (POCF) and the platooning manoeuvre control function (PMCF).
    This document specifies:
    —    POCF and PMCF governing how vehicles join and leave platoons;
    —    PMCF governing longitudinal and lateral control of each vehicle;
    NOTE  PMCF makes reference to current International Standards, such as ISO 20035, ISO 11270 and ISO 21717, where appropriate.
    —    functional evaluation test methods for POCF and PMCF.
    This document also describes:
    —    the data to be communicated for POCF and PMCF in vehicle to vehicle (V2V) messages and optionally in vehicle to infrastructure (V2I) messages, including local roadside and broader network and cloud;
    —    strategies for forming platoons, such as ad-hoc or planned formation, and types of truck platooning systems, such as top-down management and peer-to-peer.
    This document covers:
    —    platooning of heavy goods vehicles of multiple brands and fleets, operated by on-board drivers. Light trucks, buses and passenger cars are excluded;
    —    level 1 and 2 driving automation systems, which provide driver support and operate under the continuous supervision of the drivers.
    The functions and operations of the back office (BO) are out of scope of this document.
