  content: ISO/IEC 20246:2017 establishes a generic framework for work product reviews
    that can be referenced and used by all organizations involved in the management,
    development, test and maintenance of systems and software. It contains a generic
    process, activities, tasks, review techniques and documentation templates that
    are applied during the review of a work product. A work product is any artefact
    produced by a process. This document defines work product reviews that can be
    used during any phase of the life cycle of any work product. This document is
    intended for, but not limited to, project managers, development managers, quality
    managers, test managers, business analysts, developers, testers, customers and
    all those involved in the development, testing and maintenance of systems and
    software.
