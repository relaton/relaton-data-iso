    This document specifies a chassis dynamometer test procedure to measure the exhaust emissions and the electric energy and fuel consumption for the vehicles.
    This document applies to vehicles with the following characteristics:
    —          vehicles classified as passenger cars or light duty trucks, as defined in the relevant regional applicable driving test (ADT) standard;
    —     the nominal energy of the rechargeable energy storage system (RESS) is at least 2 % of the total energy consumption over an ADT;
    —     internal combustion engine (ICE) only using liquid fuels (for example, gasoline and diesel fuel).
    NOTE       In the case of the vehicles with ICE using other fuel [for example, compressed natural gas (CNG), liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), hydrogen], this document can apply except the measurement of consumed fuel; otherwise the measurement method for those using the corresponding fuel can apply.
    This document proposes procedures for correcting the measured emissions and fuel consumption of hybrid-electric vehicles (HEVs), in order to obtain the values when the state of charge (SOC) of the RESS does not remain the same between the beginning and the end of an ADT.
    It can also be applied to measurement procedures for exhaust emissions and fuel consumption of externally chargeable HEVs when a vehicle is not externally charged and operated only in the charge sustaining (CS) state, as described in ISO 23274‑2.
