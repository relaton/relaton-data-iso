abstract:
- content: "The basic concepts and general principles of word segmentation as defined
    in ISO 24614-1 apply to Chinese, Japanese and Korean. Text needs to be segmented
    into tokens, words, phrases or some other types of smaller textual units in order
    to perform certain computational applications on language resources, such as natural
    language processing, information retrieval and machine translation. ISO 24614-2:2011
    is restricted to the segmentation of a text into words or other word segmentation
    units (WSUs). This task is distinct from morphological or syntactic analysis per
    se, although it greatly depends on morphosyntactic analysis. It is also different
    from the task of laying out a framework for constructing a lexicon and identifying
    its lexical entries, namely lemmas and lexemes. The frameworks for the latter
    tasks are provided by ISO 24611, ISO 24613 and ISO 24615.\nISO 24614-2:2011 specifies
    rules for delineating WSUs for Chinese, Japanese and Korean. Some rules are common
    to all three languages, though each language also has its own distinct rules for
    identifying WSUs. The common features are discussed, then the distinct rules are
    laid out for Chinese, for Japanese and for Korean. "
