abstract:
- content: This part of ISO/IEC 11518 provides data framing for a high-performance
    point-to-point interface between data-processing equipment. This part of ISO/IEC
    11518 does not protect against certain errors that might be introduced by intermediate
    devices interconnecting multiple HIPPI-PHs. The purpose of this part of ISO/IEC
    11518 is to facilitate the development and use of the HIPPI in computer systems
    by providing common data framing. It provides an efficient framing protocol for
    interconnections between computers, high-performance display systems, and high-performance,
    intelligent block-transfer peripherals.
