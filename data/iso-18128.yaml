  content: "This International Standard intends to assist organizations in assessing
    records risks so they can ensure records continue to meet identified business
    needs as long as required.\nThe International Standard\na)\tprovides methods for
    identifying and documenting risks related to records, records processes, controls
    and systems;\nb)\tprovides techniques for analysing records risks;\nc)\tprovides
    guidelines for conducting an evaluation of records risks.\nThis International
    Standard can be used by all organizations regardless of size, nature of their
    activities, or complexity of their functions and structure. These factors, and
    the regulatory regime in which the organization operates, which prescribes the
    creation and control of its records, are taken into account when identifying and
    assessing records risk.\nDefining an organization or identifying its boundaries
    should take into account the complex structures and partnerships and contractual
    arrangements for outsourcing services and supply chains which are a common feature
    of contemporary government and corporate entities. Identifying the boundaries
    of the organization is the initial step in defining the scope of the project of
    records risk assessment.\nThis International Standard does not address directly
    the mitigation of risks, as methods for these will vary from organization to organization.\nIt
    can be used by records professionals or people who have responsibility for records
    in their organizations, and by auditors or managers who have responsibility for
    risk management programs in their organizations."
