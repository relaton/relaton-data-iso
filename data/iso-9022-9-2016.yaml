    ISO 9022-9:2016 specifies the methods relating to the environmental tests of optical instruments including additional assemblies from other fields (e.g. mechanical, chemical and electronic devices), under equivalent conditions, for their ability to resist the effects of simulated solar radiation or laboratory weathering, which is a combination of simulated solar radiation, heat, and moisture. It is applicable to instruments that may be exposed to sunlight during operation or unsheltered storage on the earth's surface, or in the lower atmosphere.
    The purpose of testing is to investigate to what extent the optical, climatic, mechanical, chemical and electrical (including electrostatic) performance characteristics of the specimen are affected by solar radiation or weathering (solar radiation, heat, and moisture).
