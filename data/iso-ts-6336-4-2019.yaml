  content: "This document describes a procedure for the calculation of the tooth flank
    fracture load capacity of cylindrical spur and helical gears with external teeth.
    \nIt is not intended to be used as a rating method in the design and certification
    process of a gearbox.\nThe formulae specified are applicable for driving as well
    as for driven cylindrical gears while the tooth profiles are in accordance with
    the basic rack specified in ISO 53. They can also be used for teeth conjugate
    to other racks where the actual transverse contact ratio is less than εα = 2,5.
    The procedure was validated for case carburized[15] gears and the formulae of
    this document are only applicable to case carburized gears with specifications
    inside the following limits:\n—          Hertzian stress: 500 N/mm2 ≤ pH ≤ 3 000
    N/mm2;\n—          Normal radius of relative curvature: 5 mm ≤ ρred ≤ 150 mm;\n—
    \         Case hardening depth at 550 HV in finished condition: 0,3 mm ≤ CHD ≤
    4,5 mm.\nThis document is not applicable for the assessment of types of gear tooth
    damage other than tooth flank fracture."
