abstract:
- content: This document provides guidance for practical applications of those principles
    in the measurement of the performance of ventilators falling under the scope of
    ISO 16494:2014. The references listed in the Bibliography give detailed information
    on the principles and theory of uncertainty as applied to measurements.
