abstract:
- content: Describes a procedure for determining the viscosity of coating materials
    and related products at a rate of shear not less than 5000 s-1 and not higher
    than 20000 s-1. When products are being compared the rate of shear shall be approximately
    the same. The test shall be made at a closely controlled temperature unless otherwise
    agreed. The value obtained gives information about the resistance of the material
    to brushing during the initial application. The method is suitable for all brushing
    paints and varnishes. More reproducible for paints having low values for fineness
    of grind as determined by ISO 1524.
