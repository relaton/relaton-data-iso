- content: |-
    This document is intended to be used alongside ISO/TR 12295, ISO 11226, the ISO 11228 series and ISO/TR 23476 in the construction sector.
    This document (although the examples shown refer only to the civil construction sector) gives information on how existing standards can be used in a global sector, such as construction. Where biomechanical overload is a relevant aspect, albeit with different characteristics, work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs) are common and specific preventive actions are needed.
    This document is intended to:
    1)       define the user(s) and fields for its application (including non-experts in ergonomics);
    2)       provide examples of procedures for hazard identification, risk estimation or evaluation and risk reduction in different agricultural settings, through:
    —     more synthetic procedural schemes (main test);
    —     more analytical explanations of the procedures, through mathematical models and application examples, and with the use of specific free simple tools in Annexes A, B and C.
