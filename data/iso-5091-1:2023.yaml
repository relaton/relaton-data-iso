    This document specifies the standards for design, construction and maintenance following completion of intervention to be applied for performing intervention work using cementitious materials to improve the performance of existing concrete structures. The intervention dealt with in this document is intended to restore, sustain or improve the mechanical performance of concrete structures. When the intervention is aimed at restoring or improving durability, reference should be made to relevant documents.
    This document covers the overlaying, underlaying and jacketing methods using cementitious materials.
    The intervention with cementitious materials is covered in ISO 16311-1, Clause 4.
