  content: "The purpose of ISO/TS 21547:2010 is to define the basic principles needed
    to securely preserve health records in any format for the long term. It concentrates
    on previously documented healthcare specific archiving problems. It also gives
    a brief introduction to the general archiving principles. Unlike the traditional
    approach to standardization work, where the perspective is that of modelling,
    code sets and messages, this Technical Specification looks at archiving from the
    angle of document management and related privacy protection. \nIn ISO/TS 21547:2010
    archiving is understood to be a wider process than just the permanent preservation
    of selected records.\nISO/TS 21547:2010 defines architecture and technology-independent
    security requirements for long-term preservation of EHRs having fixed content.\nISO/TS
    21547:2010 and a complementary Technical Report, ISO 21548, concentrate on the
    security requirements (integrity, confidentiality, availability and accountability)
    necessary for ensuring adequate protection of health information in long-term
    digital preservation. This Technical Specification will also address privacy protection
    requirements for both the EHR and eArchiving systems used in the healthcare environment.\nISO/TS
    21547:2010 defines functional security requirements for long term archiving of
    EHRs, but the practical archiving models and technology required are outside the
    concept of this Technical Specification."
