abstract:
- content: Specifies the marking system recommended to the manufacturer so as to reduce
    risks of incompatibility between components of bicycles produced according to
    new ISO Standards and traditional components. This problem of selection of the
    appropriate component will make itself felt above all at the level of the repair
    of bicycles and the distribution of spare parts; it will be necessary for this
    distinguishing mark to be universal, standardized and practical.
