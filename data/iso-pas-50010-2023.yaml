    This document gives guidance on the use of an energy management system (EnMS) in accordance with ISO 50001:2018 to achieve net zero energy (NZE), and supports the achievement of net zero carbon (NZC) and other sustainability goals. It describes how to establish an enhanced EnMS designed to achieve:
    a)       improvement of operational and maintenance practices based on NZE principles;
    b)       integration of renewable energy into operations and maintenance;
    c)        planning for facilities, systems, equipment or processes to implement NZE and NZC.
    This document does not apply to technologies, design or construction. The technical specification of passive, active or renewable energy for NZE or NZC is also not included because of different regional conditions by countries.
