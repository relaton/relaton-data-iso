    ISO 13784-1:2014 specifies a method of test for determining the reaction to fire behaviour of sandwich panel building systems, and the resulting flame spread on or within the sandwich panel building construction, when exposed to heat from a simulated internal fire with flames impinging directly on the internal corner of the sandwich panel building construction.
    The test method described is applicable to free-standing, self-supporting, and frame-supported sandwich panel systems. ISO 13784-1:2014 is not intended to apply to sandwich panel products which are glued, nailed, bonded, or similarly supported by an underlying wall or ceiling construction. For products used as internal linings, the ISO 9705 test method should be used.
    ISO 13784-1:2014 provides for small room testing of sandwich panel building systems. For large-room testing of sandwich panel building systems, ISO 13784-2:2014 should be used.
    This method is not intended to evaluate the fire resistance of a product, which should be tested by other means.
