    ISO/TS 12869:2012 specifies a method for the detection and quantification of Legionella spp. and L. pneumophila using a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). It specifies general methodological requirements, performance evaluation requirements, and quality control requirements.
    Technical details specified in ISO/TS 12869:2012 are given for information only. Any other technical solutions complying with the performance requirements are suitable.
    ISO/TS 12869:2012 is intended to be applied in the bacteriological investigation of all types of water (both hot and cold), unless the nature and/or content of suspended matter and/or accompanying flora interfere with the determination. This interference can result in an adverse effect on both the detection limit and the quantification limit.
    The results are expressed as the number of genome units of Legionella spp. and/or L. pneumophila per litre of sample.
    The method described in ISO/TS 12869:2012 is applicable to all types of water. However, some additives, e.g. chemicals used for water treatment, can interfere with and/or affect the sensitivity of the method.
    The qPCR methods do not give any information about live or dead cells.
