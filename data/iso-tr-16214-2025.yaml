    This document provides an overview of terminological entries relating to building information modelling (BIM) as well as those relating to geographic information or geomatics. This document identifies terminological entries which are identical, equivalent (i.e. synonyms), homonymous, and entries which are unique to their respective domains.
    This document does not provide recommendations to resolve terminology homonyms.
