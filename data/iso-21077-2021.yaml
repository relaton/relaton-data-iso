    The purpose of this document is to provide a common reference and framework of standards for digital motion video and imagery, and to provide recommendations for utilization of international standards for sharing or distributing motion video and imagery between spacecraft elements and ground systems.
    The scope of this document includes traditional real-time streaming video and television, including human and robotic spacecraft-to-spacecraft and spacecraft-to-ground systems, as well as video recorded and distributed later, either as a real-time stream or as a file transfer.  In this context, real-time streaming includes all modes where video is sent from a spacecraft in a continuous stream and is intended for immediate use when received, regardless of the latency of the transmission path.  Other specialized motion imagery applications, such as high-speed scientific motion imagery and multi-spectral motion imagery, are not addressed in this document.  However, if a specialized imagery camera system has a requirement to interface to spacecraft systems in a video mode, it would be required to match these interfaces.
    Ground-systems-to-ground-systems video distribution is obviously a key component of the entire video system.  However, this is not the primary focus of this document.  Currently, there are significant differences in the ways mission video products are exchanged between the various space agencies on the ground.  This is the result of differences in network topologies between space agencies, and agreements for video sharing.  Those differences preclude there being a standard methodology for delivering video imagery between agencies.  Prior to the commencement of video transmission between space agencies, system design reviews and performance testing should be done between the ground systems in use to assure operability when video imagery comes from spacecraft.
