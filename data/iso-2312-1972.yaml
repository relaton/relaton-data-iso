abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: The document specifies the sampling, the measurement of colour in Hazen
    units, determination of distillation characteristics, determination of density
    at 20 °C, determination of residue on evaporation, determination of water content,
    determination of the cloud point and the determination of carbon disulphide content.
    The principle of the CS2 determination is based on reaction of the carbon disulphide,
    in the presence of Cu(II) ions and diethylamine, to form copper diethyldithiocarbamate.
    This compound is soluble in the product which is tested giving a yellow colour
    the intensity of which is a function of the carbon disulphide content.
