abstract:
- content: |-
    This document describes processes targeted at VSEs that want to sustain and grow as an independent competitive system development organization.
    This document provides management and engineering guidelines for the systems engineering Advanced profile of the generic profile group.
    This document is applicable to VSEs that do not develop critical systems and have little or no experience with systems engineering (SE) process planning and implementation using the ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288.
    This document is also applicable to VSEs which are familiar with the management and engineering guidelines of the systems engineering Intermediate profile (ISO/IEC TR 29110 5-6-3) for their system development projects and are involved in the development of more than one project in parallel with more than one work team.
