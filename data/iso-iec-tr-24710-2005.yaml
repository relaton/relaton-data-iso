  content: "ISO/IEC 18000 defines the operation of radio frequency identification
    (RFID) air interfaces for item identification and management. \nISO/IEC 18000
    has been designed to encompass a full range of data capture and carrier functionality.
    Both read and write operations are enabled, and the interfaces can efficiently
    support both simple and complex data transactions. \nThis approach facilitates
    user implementation by providing consistency between differing types of RFID data
    transactions. Equally it provides architecture to guide future RFID development
    whilst maintaining the backward compatibility necessary to sustain market confidence.\nRecent
    developments in the design and management of distributed databases holding item
    level information have focused attention on 'identification data element' operation
    of RFID systems. In this application, the RFID tag carries only sufficient data
    to permit reference to attribute information held elsewhere. Typically this data
    does not change during the validity of the 'licence' and is of relatively low
    bit count.\nISO/IEC TR 24710:2005 has been prepared to assist users intending
    to implement ISO/IEC 18000 RFID air interface standards, with particular focus
    on so-called elementary tags, i.e. tags possessing limited memory - typically
    but not exclusively 256 bits or less - and lacking write capability (but not excluding
    WORM devices).\nThe annexes to ISO/IEC TR 24710:2005 describe the implementation
    of ISO/IEC 18000-2, -3, -4, -6 and -7 in such an application. \nUsers are strongly
    advised to refer to ISO/IEC 15961 and ISO/IEC 15962 for a full exposition of the
    management issues relating to data strings used for identification data element
    purposes. \nBodies external to ISO also specify identification data element length
    and structure for particular applications.\nISO/IEC TR 24710:2005 defines for
    each of ISO/IEC 18000-2, -3, -4, -6 and -7, and, where relevant, for each Mode
    within each part, a transaction that achieves an elementary tag 'identification
    data element' for item identification and management. \nThe transaction uses the
    existing air interface protocols defined in the corresponding parts of ISO/IEC
    18000 or a subset thereof."
