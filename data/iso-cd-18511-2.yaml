  content: "Scope of the proposed deliverable.\nThis international standard (part
    1 or part 2) specifies the method for measuring tread abrasion mass loss of a
    candidate tyre per unit distance travelled, under loaded conditions, by using
    vehicles on road (part 1) or an external drum tester (part 2).\nEach test method
    specified in Part 1 and Part 2 measures abrasion performance of a candidate tyre
    on the running mode representing vehicle driving conditions of the world. The
    test method specified by Part 1 and Part 2 uses reference tyres. \nThe target
    is to define methods with the following characteristics:\n-\trepeatable, \n-\treproducible,
    \n-\tpracticable,\n-\trepresentative of worldwide driving environment,\n-\tusable
    for regulation purpose (including market surveillance),\n-\tcost efficient,\n-\taiming
    for having a correlation between the 2 test methods in line with driving conditions
    of the world,"
