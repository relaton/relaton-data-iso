    This document specifies impact performance requirements for a vehicle security barrier (VSB) and a test method for rating its performance when subjected to a single impact by a test vehicle not driven by a human being. It is applicable to test methods for vehicle penetration distances not exceeding 25 m.
    This document is applicable to all manufacturers and procurers of VSBs, where they are used to protect people in any public or private location from the impact of vehicle attacks.
    This document does not apply to the performance of a VSB or its control apparatus when subjected to:
    —    slow speed encroachment;
    —    slow speed nudging and ramming;
    —    blast explosion;
    —    ballistic impact;
    —    manual attack, with the aid of the vehicle (multiple impacts at slow speed);
    —    manual attack, with the aid of tools (excluding vehicles);
    —    electrical manipulation;
    —    attack on the control systems by any means.
    NOTE 1   For manual attack, a variety of test methods exist. For assessing intruder resistance of building components, see LPS 1175.
    NOTE 2   The VSB is designed and tested on the basis of:
    a)     vehicle type, mass and speed of the assessed vehicle-borne threat;
    b)     its geographical application (e.g. climate conditions);
    c)     intended site location (e.g. rigid or non-rigid soil/finished surface).
    It does not apply to guidance on design, the operational suitability of a VSB or other impact test methods.
    NOTE 3   Guidance on the selection and specification of a VSB by type and operational suitability is given in ISO 22343-2.
