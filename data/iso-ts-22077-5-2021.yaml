    This document specifies a heterogeneous format of neurophysiological waveform signals to support recording in a single persistent record package as well as interoperable exchange. The document focuses on electroencephalography (EEG) waveforms created during EEG examinations. Specific provision is made for sleep polysomnography examinations (PSG), brain death determination, evoked potentials (EP), and electromyography (EMG) studies.
    This document is intended for neurophysiology.
