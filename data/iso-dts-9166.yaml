abstract:
- content: "This document describes a guideline for the self-assessment questionnaire
    systems to be used for health. This document includes the following:\n-\tstructure
    and components of the self-assessment questionnaire systems;\n-\tguidelines of
    administering and managing the self-assessment questionnaire systems;\n-\tbasic
    data elements for interacting with the self-assessment questionnaire systems.\nAnnexes
    describe various use cases on how the self-assessment questionnaire systems can
    be used as well as provide examples of HL7 FHIR Questionnaire, QuestionnaireResponse,
    and their relevant resources to represent data from self-assessment questionnaire
    systems.\nThis document does not define the self-assessment questionnaire used
    in healthcare domains or departments. The questionnaires are out of scope of this
