    ISO 18909:2006 describes test methods for determining the long-term dark storage stability of colour photographic images and the colour stability of such images when subjected to certain illuminants at specified temperatures and relative humidities.
    ISO 18909:2006 is applicable to colour photographic images made with traditional, continuous-tone photographic materials with images formed with dyes. These images are generated with chromogenic, silver dye-bleach, dye transfer, and dye-diffusion-transfer instant systems. The tests have not been verified for evaluating the stability of colour images produced with dry- and liquid-toner electrophotography, thermal dye transfer (sometimes called dye sublimation), ink jet, pigment-gelatine systems, offset lithography, gravure and related colour imaging systems.
