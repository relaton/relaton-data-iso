  content: "ISO 21849:2006 specifies the requirements for a product identification
    and traceability schema for life cycle management of aircraft and space products/parts.
    It specifies the minimum essential identification information needed for traceability
    of a product for its life cycle. It also provides the data structures for use
    with automatic identification technologies that support product/part life cycle
    data management activities.\nISO 21849:2006 defines a structure and rules for
    establishing a unique identifier for product/part identification and traceability.
    The rules and structure provide sufficient options to support various business
    practices. They provide the minimum amount of standardization required to support
    interoperability, improved business processes and efficiency across multiple users
    and applications of machine-readable media technologies.\nISO 21849:2006 also
    defines and establishes repeatable processes to allow efficient exchange of product
    data for life cycle product/part traceability, configuration, reliability, maintenance,
    and product performance management purposes.\nIt specifies the data carriers appropriate
    for representing the product data in a machine-readable form and associated dimensional
    and quality parameters.\nIndustries or trading partners will need to develop specific
    implementation guidelines to employ the principles defined in ISO 21849:2006.
    \nAlthough primarily intended for aircraft and space products/parts, ISO 21849:2006
    may be used for other products/parts where desired."
