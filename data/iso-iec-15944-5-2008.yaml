abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 15944-5:2008 is directed at being able to identify and reference
    laws and regulations impacting eBusiness scenarios and scenario components as
    external constraints. The primary source of such external constraints is jurisdictional
    domains.\nISO/IEC 15944-5:2008 focuses on addressing the simple, i.e. definable,
    aspects of external constraints for which the source is a jurisdictional domain.
    A useful characteristic of external constraints is that at the sectoral, national
    and international levels, etc. focal points and recognized authorities often already
    exist. The rules and common business practices in many sectoral areas are already
    known. Use of ISO/IEC 15944-5:2008 (and related standards) will facilitate the
    transformation of these external constraints (business rules) into specified,
    registered and reusable scenarios and scenario components.\nThe Business Transaction
    Model, explained in ISO/IEC 15944-1, has two classes of constraints, namely:\n-
    those which are self-imposed and agreed to as commitments among the parties themselves,
    i.e. internal constraints; and\n- those which are imposed on the parties to a
    business transaction based on the nature of the good, service and/or rights exchanged,
    and the nature of the commitment made among the parties (including ability to
    make commitments, the location, etc.), i.e. external constraints.\nThe focus of
    ISO/IEC 15944-5:2008 is on external constraints. Jurisdictional domains are the
    primary source of external constraints. \nISO/IEC 15944-5:2008 provides the key
    concepts required for addressing the legal environment in developing the Business
    Operational View of business transactions and scenarios which involve and are
    required to support external constraints.\nIt begins with an exploration of the
    jurisdictional domain as a source of external constraint on the business process,
    both from the perspective of a Person and as a Public Administration. It then
    presents key constraints governing ISO/IEC 15944-5:2008 through principles and
    rules.\nIt examines a key element in business transactions, that of the use of
    language. Jurisdictions can identify and, in some cases, impose the use of language
    in a business transaction. In this regard, the ISO/IEC 15944-5:2008 looks at the
    relationship of the constraint imposed by a jurisdictional domain on the choice
    of language used. \nPublic policy constraints are also examined and key requirements
    for their inclusion in external constraints are identified, especially where they
    can affect the modelling of Open-edi scenarios and the business transaction components
    of Persons, data and processes. In particular, there is a set of rules that govern
    the identification and categories of jurisdictional domains as individual states
    as well as sets of entities, both regional and international. \nISO/IEC 15944-5:2008
    also focuses on the identification of rules governing the formation and identification
    of jurisdictional domains. It identifies the more primitive subtypes of jurisdictional
    domains and includes two approaches for the unambiguous identification of referencing
    of (subtypes of) jurisdictional domain.\nISO/IEC 15944-5:2008 also provides checklists,
    through the use of templates, to guide the user through the mechanics of determining
    the source of the external constraint(s) where these are jurisdictional domains
    and determining the adequacy of the scenario specification as well as those of
    the scenario components.\nAnnexes provide elaboration on the points raised in
    the main body. "
