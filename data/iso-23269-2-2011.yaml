    ISO 23269-2:2011 specifies self-contained breathing apparatus for fire-fighters on board ships, which are required to be carried on ships by Part C (Containment of Fire) of chapter II-2 of the 1974 International Convention of Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS 74), as amended, and chapter 3 of the International Code for Fire Safety Systems (FSS Code).
    Although the breathing apparatus manufactured in accordance with ISO 23269-2:2011 are intended for use in fighting small to medium magnitude fires before the operation of any installed fixed fire-fighting systems, they are not intended or suitable for direct entry into flames.
