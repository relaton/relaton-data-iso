abstract:
- content: Applies to the description of refined nickel as well as of wrought and
    cast nickel and nickel alloys. The description for nickel alloys shall consist
    of the chemical symbols of the base element (Ni) and the alloying elements, followed
    preferably by whole numbers indicating their amount (the chemical symbols being
    listed in decreasing order according to the nominal alloy contents). Varieties
    of an alloy are specified by letter suffixes.
