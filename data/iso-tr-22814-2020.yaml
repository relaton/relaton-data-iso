- content: |-
    This document provides practical guidance for performing and interpreting measurements using dynamic light scattering (DLS) that goes beyond the treatment of measurement artefacts in ISO 22412:2017.
    This document is intended to help users with experiments planning, in particular with respect to obtaining the necessary information on the sample and deciding whether DLS is the most appropriate method. It provides information on how to prepare samples in an appropriate way, verify the proper functioning of the instrument and interpret the data correctly, including ways to assess data quality.
    This document focuses on the practical steps required to obtain DLS results of good quality, rather than on theoretical considerations, and covers not only the measurement of solid particles, but also emulsions and bubbles.
