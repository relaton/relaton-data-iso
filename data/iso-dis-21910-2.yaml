abstract:
- content: This standard provides the principle, device and operation of measuring
    the bubble size and number-based bubble size distribution of microbubbles in liquid
    media by the in-situ dynamic image analysis method. The standard is suitable for
    microbubbles dispersed in transparent liquid media with bubble sizes ranging from
    1 micron to 500 micron. The upper limit of bubble concentration depends on factors
    such as measurement instrument design, including light source, light path and
    graphical algorithm.
