  content: Lays down a method of revealing pores or other discontinuities, when testing
    metallic coatings, that are not visibly affected by ferricyanide and chloride
    ions during the test period and that are cathodic to iron and steel. This method
    is especially useful for thick, hard chromium coatings used for wear resistance.
