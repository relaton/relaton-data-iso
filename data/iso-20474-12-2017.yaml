- content: |-
    ISO 20474-12:2017 gives the safety requirements specific to cable excavators as defined in ISO 6165. It is intended to be used in conjunction with ISO 20474‑1, which specifies general safety requirements common to two or more earth-moving machine families. The specific requirements given in this document take precedence over the general requirements of ISO 20474‑1.
    ISO 20474-12:2017 deals with all significant hazards, hazardous situations and events relevant to the earth-moving machinery within its scope (see ISO 20474‑1:2017, Annex A) when used as intended or under conditions of misuse reasonably foreseeable by the manufacturer. It specifies the appropriate technical measures for eliminating or reducing risks arising from relevant hazards, hazardous situations or events during commissioning, operation and maintenance.
    It is applicable only to the machine itself if the cable excavator is intended for use in combination with other equipment or attachments such as drill rigs and those for pile driving or extracting and moving (e.g. rail-track, walking legs, pontoon, ship equipment or stationary undercarriages). It does not deal with the specific hazards relevant to such additional equipment or attachments.
    ISO 20474-12:2017 is not applicable to machines manufactured before the date of its publication.
