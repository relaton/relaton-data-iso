  content: In order to size mass-produced clothes, the body size of the intended wearer
    has to be defined and identified with the nearest size on a table of standard
    sizes. The processing of body measurement data as described in ISO/TR 10652 results
    in the grouping of body sizes. The sizing systems presented in annexes A to C
    are exemplary only. This Technical Report establishes a body sizing system to
    be used for compiling standard garment sizes for infants, men and boys and women
    and girls.
