    This document specifies the loads, the load combinations and the design procedures for the design of shaft system structures in both vertical and decline shafts. The shaft system structures covered by this document include buntons, guides and rails, station structures, rock loading structures, brattice walls, conveyance and vehicle arresting structures and dropsets, services supports, rope guide anchor supports and box fronts.
    Rock support is excluded from the scope of this document.
    This document does not cover matters of operational safety, or layout of the shaft system structures
    This document adopts a limit states design philosophy.
