abstract:
- content: ISO 9635-5:2006 specifies construction and performance requirements and
    test methods for control valves, intended for operation in irrigation systems
    with water at temperatures not exceeding 60 °C, which can contain fertilizers
    and other chemicals of the types and concentrations used in agriculture. It is
    applicable to hydraulically operated control irrigation valves of DN 15 (1/2 inch)
    diameter or greater, designed to operate in any position, from fully open to fully
    closed. The valves can either be directly operated (i.e. the force applied via
    a spring or diaphragm to the obturator), or pilot-operated (i.e. the force is
    applied through an adjustable pilot valve via a diaphragm).
