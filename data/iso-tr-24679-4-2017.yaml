    ISO/TR 24679-4:2017 provides a fire engineering application relative to the fire resistance assessment of a fifteen-storey steel framed building following the methodology given in ISO 24679-1. This document describes the adopted process which follows the same step by step procedure as that provided in ISO 24679-1. The annexes of this document present the detailed assessment results obtained for the most severe fire scenarios on the basis of the outcome of this specific fire safety engineering procedure for the building.
    The fire safety engineering applied in this example to the office building with respect to its fire resistance considers specific design fire scenarios as well as the corresponding fire development. It takes into account fully-developed compartment fires. In realistic situations, activation of fire suppression systems and/or intervention of fire brigade are expected, but their beneficial effects are not taken into account. It should be noted that these severe fire scenarios have been selected for fire resistance purposes.
    Global structural behaviour is not explicitly considered, but implicitly included in the calculation formulae. Since the building of the example is located in a seismic region, principal structural elements are rigidly connected to each other. Load redistribution from heated elements to cold surrounding elements exists, but it's not taken into account in the design calculations. By this approach, design is conservative, while the process of safety checking is greatly simplified and clear. As a result, all the calculations were carried out by explicit algebraic formulae.
