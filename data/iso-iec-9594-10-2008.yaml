    ISO/IEC 9594-10:2008 describes the requirements for Directory management and analyses these requirements to identify those that may be realized by OSI Systems Management services (and protocols), those that are realized by Directory services (and protocols), and those that are realized by local means.
    Based on the requirements, this Directory Specification defines a model for Directory management that encompasses all of the requirements.
    Management of the Directory is divided into four major segments:
    - management of the DIT Domain: Management of Directory information;
    - management of the operation of a single DSA within a DMD;
    - management of the operation of a single DUA within a DMD; and
    - management of the Directory Management Domain (DMD): Integrated management of the functional components of the Directory.
    ISO/IEC 9594-10:2008 covers the first three items listed above; management of the Directory Management Domain is for further study.
    Based on the model, ISO/IEC 9594-10:2008 describes the detailed OSI Systems Management Managed Objects used to manage Directory System Agents (DSAs) and Directory User Agents (DUAs) within a Directory Domain and describes the detailed OSI Systems Management Managed Objects used to manage the interfaces to DUAs and DSAs in other domains.
