abstract:
- content: "ISO 11960:2004 specifies the technical delivery conditions for steel pipes
    (casing, tubing, plain end casing liners and pup joints), coupling stock and accessories
    and establishes requirements for three Product Specification Levels (PSL-1, PSL-2,
    PSL-3). The requirements for PSL-1 are the basis of ISO 11960:2004. The requirements
    that define different levels of standard technical requirements for PSL-2 and
    PSL-3, for all Grades except H-40 and L-80 9Cr, are contained in Annex H. \nISO
    11960:2004 is applicable to the following connections in accordance with API Spec
    5B:\n-- short round thread casing (STC);\n-- long round thread casing (LC);\n--
    buttress thread casing (BC);\n-- extreme-line casing (XC);\n-- non-upset tubing
    (NU);\n-- external upset tubing (EU);\n-- integral joint tubing (IJ).\nFor such
    connections, ISO 11960:2004 specifies the technical delivery conditions for couplings
    and thread protection. Supplementary requirements that may optionally be agreed
    for enhanced leak resistance connections are given in Annex A.11 (SR22). \nISO
    11960:2004 can also be applied to tubulars with connections not covered by ISO/API
    standards.\nFor pipes covered by ISO 11960:2004, the sizes, masses and wall thicknesses
    as well as grades and applicable end finishes are given.\nBy agreement between
    the purchaser and manufacturer, ISO 11960:2004 can also be applied to other plain
    end pipe sizes and wall thicknesses.\nThe four groups of products to which ISO
    11960:2004 is applicable include the following grades of pipe:\n-- Group 1: All
    casing and tubing in Grades H, J, K and N;\n-- Group 2: All casing and tubing
    in Grades C, L, M and T;\n-- Group 3: All casing and tubing in Grade P;\n-- Group
    4: All casing in Grade Q.\nCasing sizes larger than Label 1: 4-1/2 but smaller
    than Label 1: 10-3/4 may be specified by the purchaser to be used in tubing service.\nSupplementary
    requirements that may optionally be agreed between purchaser and manufacturer
    for non-destructive examination, coupling blanks, upset casing, electric-welded
    casing, impact testing, seal ring couplings and certificates are given in Annex
    A.\nISO 11960:2004 is not applicable to threading requirements."
