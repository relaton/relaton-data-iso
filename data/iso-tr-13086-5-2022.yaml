    This document provides information for the design of composite cylinders related to impact testing and service experience with impact, including:
    —    low energy impact, which can result from events that can occur during handling or working around cylinders;
    —    high energy impact, which can result from accidents during transportation, or impact by large objects with velocity;
    —    drop impact, which can result from handling, where cylinders are dropped or tipped over; and
    —    high velocity impact, which can result from high energy impact by a small object, such as gunfire, and demonstrates non-shatterability of the cylinder or tube.
    Where appropriate, field experience relevant to testing requirements is provided.
    NOTE       Unless otherwise stated, the word “cylinder” refers to both cylinders and tubes.
