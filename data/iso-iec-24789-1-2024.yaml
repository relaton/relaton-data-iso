    This document comprises a methodology for determining a test plan to simulate a card's service life. The methodology defines two parameters of card service life: the expected card service life in years and the average number of uses per day.
    This document and ISO/IEC 24789-2, together along with ISO/IEC 10373-1 describe the evaluation methods to be used and their criteria.
    This document was originally developed for ID-1 cards conforming to ISO/IEC 7810 but can be useful in whole or in part for other types and form factors.
