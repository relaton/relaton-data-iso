abstract:
- content: "ISO 16840-1:2006 applies to seating intended to provide postural support
    within a wheelchair. It specifies: \n- a global coordinate system that permits
    the determination and recording of a person's posture while seated in a wheelchair;
    \n-  the standard terms and definitions for use in describing both the posture
    and the anthropometrics of a person seated in a wheelchair;\n- the terms and definitions
    for describing the dimensions, location and orientation of seating support surfaces,
    which together comprise the body support system. \nISO 16840-1:2006 does not specify
    any methods for use in measuring a person's seated posture, nor does it define
    terms for dynamic physiological movements (such as flexion or extension).\nISO
    16840-1:2006 might be applicable to seating other than that intended to be used
    within a wheelchair."
