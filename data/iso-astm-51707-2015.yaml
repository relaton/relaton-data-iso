  content: "ISO/ASTM 51707:2015 provides guidance on the use of concepts described
    in the JCGM Evaluation of Measurement Data ? Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty
    in Measurement (GUM) to estimate the uncertainties in the measurement of absorbed
    dose in radiation processing. \nMethods are given for identifying, evaluating
    and estimating the components of measurement uncertainty associated with the use
    of dosimetry systems and for calculating combined standard measurement uncertainty
    and expanded (overall) uncertainty of dose measurements based on the GUM methodology.
    \nExamples are given on how to develop a measurement uncertainty budget and a
    statement of uncertainty. \nISO/ASTM 51707:2015 is one of a set of standards that
    provides recommendations for properly implementing dosimetry in radiation processing,
    and provides guidance for achieving compliance with the requirements of ISO/ASTM
    52628 related to the evaluation and documentation of the uncertainties associated
    with measurements made with a dosimetry system. It is intended to be read in conjunction
    with ISO/ASTM 52628, ISO/ASTM 51261 and ISO/ASTM 52701."
