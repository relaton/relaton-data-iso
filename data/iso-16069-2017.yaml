abstract:
- content: |-
    ISO 16069:2017 describes the principles governing the design and application of visual components used to create a safety way guidance system (SWGS).
    ISO 16069:2017 contains general principles valid both for electrically powered and for phosphorescent components. Special information which is related to the type of component is given to assist in defining the environment of use, choice of material, layout, installation and maintenance of SWGS.
    ISO 16069:2017 does not cover risk assessment. Applications with different risks to the occupants typically require different layouts and types of SWGS. The specific application and exact final design of SWGS is entrusted to those persons responsible for this task.
    ISO 16069:2017 also does not include the special considerations of possible tactile or audible components of SWGS, nor does it include requirements for high mounted components of the emergency escape route lighting, especially the design and application of emergency escape route lighting.
    ISO 16069:2017 is intended, by collaboration and coordination, to be used by all other Technical Committees within ISO and IEC charged with developing SWGS for their specific requirements. ISO 16069:2017 is not to be used for ships falling under regulations of the International Maritime Organization (IMO).
