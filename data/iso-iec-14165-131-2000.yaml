abstract:
- content: This ISO/IEC standard for FC-SW specifies tools and algorithms for interconnection
    and initialization of Fibre Channel switches to create a multi-switch Fibre Channel
    Fabric. This Standard defines an E_Port (ìExpansion Portî) that operates in a
    manner similar to an N_Port and F_Port, as defined in ISO/IEC 14165- 111, with
    additional functionality provided for interconnecting switches. This Standard
    also defines how ports that are capable of being an E_Port, F_Port, and/or FL_Port
    may discover and self-configure for their appropriate operating mode. Once a port
    establishes that it is connected to another switch and is operating as an E_Port,
    an address assignment algorithm is executed to allocate port addresses throughout
    the Fabric. This Standard does not define credit models and management between
    E_Ports for the various Classes of Service other than Class F. Broadcast and multicast
    services are not defined. E_Ports conforming to this Standard support Class F,
    and also Class 1, Class 2, and/or Class 3; support for other Classes of Service
    are not defined by this Standard. The method by which routing of frames is established
    and effected is not described.
