    ISO/TR 16250:2013 specifies a method to calculate the level of correlation between two non-ambiguous signals.
    The focus of the methods is on the comparison of time-history signals or functional responses obtained in all kinds of tests of the passive safety of vehicles and the corresponding numerical simulations. It is validated with signals of various kinds of physical loads such as forces, moments, accelerations, velocities, and displacements.
    Other applications might be possible too, but are not in the scope of ISO/TR 16250:2013.
