abstract:
- content: Its use is mandatory for the calibration of secondary standard pyranometers
    according to ISO 9060, and is recommended for the calibration of pyranometers
    which are used as reference instruments in comparisons. Is intended for use by
    test institutions or test laboratories equipped with well-maintained pyrheliometers
    and is applicable to all pyranometers. The object is to promote the uniform application
    of reliable methods to calibrate pyranometers, since accurate calibration factors
    are the basis of accurate hemispherical solar radiation data which are needed
    for solar energy test applications or simulations.
