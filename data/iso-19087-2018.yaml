  content: "This document is a standard for the analysis by Fourier-Transform Infrared
    (FTIR) of respirable crystalline silica (RCS) in samples of air collected on collection
    substrates (i.e. filters or foams). Three analytical approaches are described
    for whom the dust from the sample collection substrate is\na)    analysed directly
    on sampled filter,\nb)    recovered, treated and deposited onto another filter
    for analysis, or\nc)    recovered, treated and pressed into a potassium bromide
    (KBr) pellet for analysis.\nThis document provides information on the instrumental
    parameters, the sensitivity of different sampling apparatus, the use of different
    filters and sample treatment to remove interference. In this document the expression
    RCS includes the most common polymorphs quartz and cristobalite. \nThis document
    excludes the less common polymorphs of crystalline silica, such as tridymite.
    \nUnder certain circumstances (i.e. low filter dust loads, low silica content),
    the analytical approach described in this method cannot fulfil the expanded uncertainty
    requirements of ISO 20581. Guidance for calculation of uncertainty for measurements
    of RCS is given in ISO 24095."
