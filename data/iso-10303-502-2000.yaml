    This part of ISO 10303 specifies the interpretation of the integrated resources to satisfy requirements for the
    representation of the product shape using three-dimensional wireframe models which are bounded by a set
    of shells.
    The following are within the scope of this part of ISO 10303:
    — the representation of wireframe models that are described by a graph of edges and vertices where the
    edges intersect only at their vertices;
    — the representation of a wireframe model by one or more shells that shall not overlap or intersect except
    at their vertices or edges;
    — points defined in a three-dimensional coordinate space;
    — curves, including b-splines, defined in a three-dimensional coordinate space;
    — the representation of a single wireframe model or an assembly of wireframe models.
    The following are outside the scope of this part of ISO 10303:
    — geometry defined in a two-dimensional coordinate space;
    — surface geometry;
    — solid geometry;
    — references to eliminated constructs.
