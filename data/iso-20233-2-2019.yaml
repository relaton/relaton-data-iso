    This document specifies a model test method for propeller cavitation noise evaluation in ship design, focusing mainly on the noise source localization.
    The procedure comprises the model test set-up, noise measurements, data processing and source localization. The target noise source being propeller cavitation, this document describes the test set-up and conditions to reproduce the cavitation patterns of the ship, which is the same as in ISO 20233‑1. The noise measurements are performed using a hydrophone array for the source localizations. Therefore, the instrumentation of the hydrophone array is also addressed, as well as a suitable array signal processing of the measured data. Finally, a method to visualize and to interpret the results is presented.
