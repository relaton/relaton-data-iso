  content: Specifies determination methods, requirements for test installations, procedures,
    and presentation of results. May also be applied to other fluid power components
    where similar conditions apply. Accuracy of measurement is divided into three
    classes (A,B, and C) which are explained in annex A. Pipe loss is given in annex
    B. Guidance as to the use of practical units for the presentation of results is
    given in annex C. Annex D provides a pre-test checklist of those items on which
    agreement is recommended between the parties concerned.
