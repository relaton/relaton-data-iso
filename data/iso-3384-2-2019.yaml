abstract:
- content: |-
    This document specifies two methods for determining the decrease in counterforce exerted by a test piece of vulcanized or thermoplastic rubber which has been compressed to a constant deformation and then undergoes temperature cycling.
    Method A: The temperature is cycled at intervals between a high temperature for ageing and a low temperature for checking the sealing force at this low temperature.
    Method B: The temperature is cycled continuously between a high temperature and a low temperature to introduce thermal stress in the test piece.
    The counterforce is determined by means of a continuous-measurement system.
    Two forms of test pieces are specified in this document: cylindrical test pieces and rings. Comparison of results is valid only when made on test pieces of similar size and shape.
    The use of ring test pieces is particularly suitable for the determination of stress relaxation in liquid environments.
