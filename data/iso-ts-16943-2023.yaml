abstract:
- content: "This document describes phased array ultrasonic testing (PAUT) of polyethylene
    electrofusion (EF) socket joints used for the conveyance of fluids. \nThis document
    provides a test whereby the presence of imperfections such as voids, wire dislocation,
    misalignment, pipe under-penetration, particulate contamination and lack of fusion
    in electrofusion socket joints can be detected. \nThe technique is only applicable
    to polyethylene electrofusion socket fittings without a barrier to ultrasonic
    waves.\nThis document also provides requirements for procedure qualification and
    guidance for personnel qualifications, which are essential for the application
    of this test technique.\nThis document covers the test equipment, the preparation
    and performance of the test, the assessment of indications and the reporting for
    polyethylene EF joints.\nAcceptance criteria are not covered in this document.\nNOTE
    1        At the time of publication, experience only exists in the use of PAUT
    for polyethylene (PE80 and PE100) electrofusion socket joint sizes between 90 mm
    and 710 mm (SDR 11 and 17).[1][2][3][4][5][6][7]\nNOTE 2        Interlaboratory
    testing has shown that PAUT is a viable method for enhancing the integrity assessment
    of electrofusion joints.[8][15][16]\nNOTE 3        This document does not apply
    to the detection of unscraped pipe. Such detection can be achieved by simple visual
    testing, provided mechanical scraping tools are employed.\nNOTE 4        PAUT
    techniques for cold fusion detection are known to be available. However further
    research verification and experience are needed to transfer the technique into
    an ISO International Standard. This document does not provide any information
    regarding the detection of cold fusions."
