abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 30182:2017 describes, and gives guidance on, a smart city concept
    model (SCCM) that can provide the basis of interoperability between component
    systems of a smart city, by aligning the ontologies in use across different sectors.
    It includes:\n-      concepts (e.g. ORGANIZATION, PLACE, COMMUNITY, ITEM, METRIC,
    SERVICE, RESOURCE); and\n-      relationships between concepts (e.g. ORGANIZATION
    has RESOURCEs, EVENT at a PLACE).\nThe SCCM does not replace existing models where
    they exist, but, by mapping from a local model to a parent model, questions can
    be asked about data in a new and joined-up way. \nISO/IEC 30182:2017 is aimed
    at organizations that provide services to communities in cities, and manage the
    resulting data, as well as decision-makers and policy developers in cities.1)
    \nThe SCCM is relevant wherever many organizations provide services to many communities
    within a place. \nIt does not cover the data standards that are relevant to each
    concept in the SCCM and does not attempt to list or recommend the sources of identifiers
    and categorizations that cities map to the SCCM. \nThe SCCM has been devised to
    communicate the meaning of data. It does not attempt to provide concepts to describe
    the metadata of a dataset, for example, validity and provenance of data. \nIt
    covers semantic interoperability, that is, defining the meaning of data, particularly
    from many sources. It does not cover other barriers to interoperability, some
    of which are described at 3.2."
