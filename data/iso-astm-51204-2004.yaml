abstract:
- content: |-
    ISO/ASTM 51204:2004 outlines the installation qualification program for an irradiator and the dosimetric procedures to be followed during operational qualification, performance qualification, and routine processing in facilities that process food with ionizing radiation from radionuclide gamma sources to ensure that product has been treated within a predetermined range of absorbed dose. Other procedures related to operational qualification, performance qualification, and routine processing that may influence absorbed dose in the product are also discussed.
    Information about effective or regulatory dose limits for food products is not within the scope of ISO/ASTM 51204:2004. ISO/ASTM 51204:2004 does not provide guidance in the selection and calibration of dosimetry systems, and interpretation of measured absorbed dose in the product or the use of specific dosimetry systems.
    ISO/ASTM 51204:2004 does not purport to address all of the safety concerns, if any, associated with its use.
