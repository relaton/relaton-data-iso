  content: "This document provides guidance for a more flexible implementation of
    ISO 37101. This can be appropriate for smaller urban settlements or those dominated
    by a specialised function. Others can be starting on their journey of maturing
    sustainability from a very low-level base, or aim to explore sustainable development
    in a gradual, phased way due to limited resources. Some will want to rapidly initiate
    action that will have an immediate impact to demonstrate value and stimulate wider
    support. It provides practical toolkits to achieve implementation (e.g. policies
    and economic incentives, technical tools, and self-assessment checklists). \nThis
    document applies to urban settlements of any composition and type."
