    ISO 19030-2:2016 defines the default method for measuring changes in hull and propeller performance and calculating a set of basic performance indicators. Finally, it provides guidance on the expected accuracy of each performance indicator.
    ISO 19030-2:2016 is applicable for commercial ship types of the displacement type driven by conventional fixed pitch propeller(s) where the objective is to compare the hull and propeller performance of the same ship to itself over time.
    NOTE          Support for additional configurations (e.g. variable pitch propellers) will, if justified, be included in later revisions of this document.
