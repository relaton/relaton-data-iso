    This standard describes the physical interface portions of high performance optical link variants that support the higher level Fibre Channel protocols including FC-FS-4 (reference [1]) and FC-FS-5 (reference [2]).
    FC-PI-7 specifies 64GFC. 32GFC and 128GFC are described in FC-PI-6 (reference [3]) and FC-PI- 6P (reference [4]), respectively.16GFC, 8GFC and 4GFC are described in FC-PI-5 (reference [5]).
