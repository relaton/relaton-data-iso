    ISO 13033:2013 establishes the means to derive seismic actions on nonstructural components and systems (NSCS) supported by or attached to new or existing buildings. It also provides procedures for the verification of NSCS seismic capacities. NSCS include architectural elements, mechanical and electrical systems, and building contents.
    ISO 13033:2013 is not a legally binding and enforceable code. It is a source document that is utilized in the development of codes of practice by the competent authority responsible for issuing structural design regulations. It is intended for application by regional and national standards committees when preparing standards for the seismic performance of NSCS.
    ISO 13033:2013 does not specifically cover industrial facilities, including nuclear power plants, since these are dealt with separately in other International Standards. However, the principles in ISO 13033:2013 can be appropriate for the derivation of seismic actions for NSCS in such facilities.
