abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC TS 29140-2:2011 provides a learner information model specific
    to mobile learning that can be used as a reference by software developers, implementers,
    instructional designers, trainers, automated systems, and learning management
    systems to ensure that learning, education, and training (LET) environments reflect
    the specific needs of mobile participants. Since these needs impact on other standardization
    efforts and other work items in LET, a concise view is necessary. \nISO/IEC TS
    29140-2:2011 provides\n-        a definition of mobile learning that is appropriate
    for all sectors in LET,\n-        the description of the learner information model
    for mobile learning,\n-        specific learner information that supports learners
    engaged in mobile learning activities in LET environments. \nIn addition, ISO/IEC
    TS 29140-2:2011 provides some initial guidance regarding the issue of privacy.
    This includes ensuring that ISO/IEC TS 29140-2:2011 does not contravene any privacy
    requirements."
