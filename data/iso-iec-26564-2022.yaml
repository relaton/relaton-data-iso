- content: |-
    This document, within the context of methods and tools that support the product line measurement and management and that demonstrate the quality of the products and a product line:
    —    specifies processes for product line measurement (the processes are described in terms of purpose, inputs, tasks and outcomes);
    —    specifies method capabilities to support the defined tasks of each process;
    —    specifies tool capabilities that automate or semi-automate tasks and methods.
    This document does not concern the processes and capabilities of tools and methods for a single system but rather deals with those for a family of products.
