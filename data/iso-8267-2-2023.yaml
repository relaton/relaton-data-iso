    This document specifies the interface requirements for tow bar attachment fittings on the nose gear (when towing operations are performed from the nose gear) of conventional tricycle type landing gears of commercial civil transport aircraft.
    This document is applicable to all new models of regional aircraft within the specified maximum ramp mass range which enter service or are designed after its date of publication.
    It does not apply to previously in-service regional aircraft models, which present a considerable variety of tow bar attachment fittings. However, a simple retrofit modification is described that can make certain in-service fittings compatible with a tow bar head in conformity with this document, where deemed appropriate in order to facilitate operation of such aircraft types at airports.
    This document is applicable to regional commercial transport aircraft airworthiness certified with a maximum ramp mass of ≤ 50 000 kg (110 000 lb). It does not apply to:
    —     aircraft airworthiness certified as commuter category aeroplanes;
    —     aircraft airworthiness certified as main line aircraft with a maximum ramp mass of > 50 000 kg (110 000 lb), which are covered by ISO 8267-1.
