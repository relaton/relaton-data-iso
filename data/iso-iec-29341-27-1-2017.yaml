abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 29341-27-1:2017 is compliant with the UPnP Device Architecture
    version 1.0. It defines a service type referred to herein as FriendlyInfoUpdate
    service . It is scoped to the Device Description Document (DDD) and is a service
    allowing control points to create orderly updates to the <friendlyName> and <iconList>
    elements. Once a change has taken place the status of the DDD might not reflect
    that of the advertised description because the device can not  leave the network
    during ongoing activities. Therefore a state variable is provided to indicate
    if the DDD contains non-advertised (pending) values. If for any reason the device
    goes off line, power cycles, or reboots it will most likely advertise its new
    DDD. If DeviceProtection UPnP DP is implemented on the device then it will support
    restricting control point actions to control points with specific Roles.
