abstract:
- content: This document specifies a test method for preparation of test prints produced
    with liquid printing inks, either water-based, solvent-based or radiation cured
    printing inks as used in flexography and gravure printing. Such test prints are
    intended to be used for reflection-based measurements, such as colorimetry and
    optical density as well as for testing light fastness, and the resistance of printing
    inks to mechanical and chemical attack regarding either printing ink and/or substrate.
    This document is not applicable to inks for ink jet printing.
