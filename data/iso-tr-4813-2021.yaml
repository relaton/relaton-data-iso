  content: This document provides the background for ISO 11171:2020 and the use of
    µm(c) as the sole means of reporting particle size for APC particle count data.
    It also summarizes results of the international inter-laboratory study (ILS) of
    its reproducibility using SRM 2806d candidate material and suspensions of Reference
    Material (RM) 8632a. The ILS results provided the basis for certification of SRM
    2806d used for primary calibration of APC. Their implications with respect to
    particle counting and filter testing are discussed in this document.
