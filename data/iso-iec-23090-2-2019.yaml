    This document specifies the omnidirectional media format for coding, storage, delivery, and rendering of omnidirectional media, including video, images, audio, and timed text.
    In an OMAF player the user's viewing perspective is from the centre of the sphere looking outward towards the inside surface of the sphere.
    NOTE 1  In this document, only 3 degrees of freedom (3DOF) is supported. In other words, purely translational movement of the user does not result in different omnidirectional media being rendered to the user. For 3DOF support with stereoscopic video, when the user rolls his/her head, there could be a stereoscopic rendering issue.
    NOTE 2  Omnidirectional video could contain graphics elements generated by computer graphics but encoded as video.
