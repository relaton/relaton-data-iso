    This document provides guidance related to the necessary mine closure and reclamation planning activities for new and operating mines. Recommendations are provided on:
    —    closure and reclamation of a mine site;
    —    land reclamation and water management;
    —    stakeholder engagement;
    —    decision and analysis tools.
    The following aspects of closure and reclamation are not addressed in this document:
    —    infrastructure such as rail lines, ports, off-site ore loaders, power stations, etc. that are associated with the mine operation, but which are not located at the mine site;
    —    detailed survey, testing or monitoring methods, detailed engineering procedures, detailed product requirements, or detailed construction and operational procedures; occupational health and safety management related to closure and reclamation, construction and exploration activities;
    —    relinquishment of a closed and reclaimed mine site, or portions thereof, to a party (governmental or private entity) not related to the mine operator;
    —    specific requirements for dealing with the radiological aspects of mine closure and reclamation, such as those that occur at uranium mining and processing facilities and other mines at which naturally occurring radioactive materials are present; however, the other aspects associated with closure and reclamation of these mines are included in this document; and
    —    closure and reclamation of abandoned mines.
