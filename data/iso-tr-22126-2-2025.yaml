  content: "This document is concerned with the representation of the ISO 20022 e-Repository
    contents in RDF and OWL by developing a case study around the ISO 20022 auth.016
    sample message (hereafter simply referred to as “auth.016”). This includes:  \na)      
    transformation of the sample message into an RDF instance graph;  \nb)       demonstrating
    a set of SPARQL rules that transform the auth.016 message into a FIX TradeCaptureReport(35=AE)
    message (hereafter simply referred to as “FIX AE”); \nc)        expressing the
    metamodel, business components and message components exactly with a custom RDF
    vocabulary; \nd)       representing those schemas as OWL schemas using OWL vocabulary
    when possible and annotation properties otherwise;\ne)       creating instance
    graphs for the auth.016 sample messaging using the vocabulary of the business
    components and message components. \nThis document also discusses the choices
    that arise in structuring RDF documents equivalent to documents in XML, and FIX
    Tag-Value format balancing considerations such as preserving the order of parts
    of the message versus creating graphs that are suitable for RDFS and OWL inference."
