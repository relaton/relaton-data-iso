  content: "ISO/IEC 14496-23:2008 specifies Symbolic Music Representation (SMR). A
    symbolic representation of music is a logical structure based on:\nThe Symbolic
    Music Representation enables the development of new applications in several domains
    of entertainment, edutainment, infotainment, etc., from education and distance
    learning, to rehearsal and musical practice at home, from consumer electronics
    like set-top boxes for interactive TV to personal computers and mobiles systems.
    The SMR may be used to represent many kinds of symbolic music including different
    styles of Chant, Renaissance, Classic, Romantic and 20th Century styles, Korean
    notation, simplified notations for children, Braille, etc.. \nISO/IEC 14496-23:2008
    specifies\n- Symbolic Music Extensible Format (SM-XF) an XML based language used
    to encode musical scores as main scores, single parts and the associated lyrics;
    \n- Symbolic Music Formatting Language (SM-FL) an XML based language used to define
    the rendering rules that are applied to the SM-XF format for rendering it; \n-
    Symbolic Music Synchronization Information (SM-SI) a binary format describing
    the synchronisation information between the SMR elements and the other audiovisual
    elements; \n- syntax and semantics of the SMR bitstream. "
