abstract:
- content: |-
    This document specifies performance requirements for surrogate targets used to assess the system detection and activation performance of active safety systems.
    This document specifies the properties of a vehicle target that will allow it to represent a passenger vehicle in terms of size, shape, reflection properties, etc. for testing purposes. The document addresses the detection requirements for a vehicle target in terms of sensing technologies commonly in use at the time of publication of this document, and where possible, anticipated future sensing technologies. It also addresses methodologies to verify the target response properties to these sensors, as well as performance requirements for the target carrier.
    This document specifies the properties of the vehicle target for simulation of rear-end scenarios, with overlap greater than 50 %. The specifications of vehicle targets in this document are intended to address current and anticipated test protocols related to safety critical events in which the subject vehicle approaches a stopped, braking or slower moving (target) vehicle from behind and in the forward path of the subject vehicle.
    This document does not address the test procedures in terms of speeds, positions, or timing of events. Performance criteria for the active safety system are also not addressed.
