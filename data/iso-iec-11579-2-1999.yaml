abstract:
- content: |-
    This part of ISO/IEC 11579 specifies a reference configuration (RC) for high-speed private integrated services
    network exchanges (HS-PINX), for their interconnection to form high-speed private integrated services networks
    (HS-PISN). The configuration is intended to provide guidance for the specification of PINX capabilities, but does not
    impose any specific implementation of a HS-PINX.
    This RC describes a conceptual HS-PINX. By combining multiple HS-PINXs to a high-speed private integrated
    services network the RC becomes applicable to a HS-PISN. This is generically described in ISO/IEC 11579-1.
    This RC satisfies the support of all HS applications, such as LAN, MAN, B-ISDN, etc.
