    ISO 22965-2:2007 applies to concrete for structures cast in situ, pre-cast structures and structural pre-cast products for buildings and civil engineering structures. The concrete can be mixed on-site, ready-mixed concrete or produced in a plant for pre-cast concrete products.
    ISO 22965-2:2007 applies to concrete compacted to retain no appreciable amount of entrapped air other than entrained air and to normal-weight, heavy-weight and light-weight concrete.
    Other International Standards for specific products, e.g. pre-cast products, or for processes within the field of the scope of this standard can require or permit deviations from ISO 22965-2:2007.
    ISO 22965-2:2007 specifies properties of the constituent materials, the production of concrete and the compliance system of concrete.
    ISO 22965-2:2007 does not apply to concrete with a maximum aggregate size equal to or less than 4 mm or 5 mm (mortar), aerated concrete, foamed concrete, concrete with an open structure ("no-fine aggregate" concrete), concrete with a density less than 800 kg/m3 or refractory concrete.
    ISO 22965-2:2007 does not cover health and safety requirements for the protection of workers during production and delivery of concrete.
