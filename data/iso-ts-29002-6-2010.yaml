abstract:
- content: |-
    ISO/TS 29002-6:2010 specifies a conceptual information model and
    an exchange file format for terminology information from a concept
    dictionary. The conceptual model is in Unified Modeling Language
    (UML). The physical file format is based on Extensible Markup
    Language (XML).
    The XML structures defined in ISO/TS 29002-6:2010 are intended
    to be returned by calls to the Terminology Service defined in
    ISO/TS 29002-20. The Terminology Service is an interface for
    retrieving terminological information about a concept from a
    concept dictionary.
    ISO/TS 29002-6:2010 was developed as a common resource to
    provide a level of interoperability between implementations of ISO
    13584 and ISO 22745 for exchange of information from a concept
    dictionary. Its use is not restricted to these standards, however.
    It can be restricted through implementation profiles by standards
    that reference it. It can also be implemented without
    restriction.
