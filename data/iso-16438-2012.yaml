    ISO 16438:2012 specifies requirements and test methods for reinforced and non-reinforced thermoplastic collapsible hoses, which are intended to be used as main and sub-main supply lines for the conveyance and distribution of water for irrigation at water temperatures up to 50 °C.
    It is applicable to irrigation hoses with nominal diameters between 40 mm and 500 mm and working pressures between 0,3 bar (0,03 MPa) and 6 bar (0,6 MPa).
    ISO 16438:2012  is applicable to two types of hose configurations: distributor hose (with outlet connections) and plain hose (without outlet connections).
