    This document specifies additional requirements for ISO/IEC 17021-1 in order to enable accredited and or peer assessed certification bodies to reliably audit the management system for organizations that develop or use AI systems or both according to ISO/IEC 42001 and to make an evaluation and decision for certification. The application of this document enables the certification bodies to meet the specific technical features and the particular risks in dealing with AI systems according to ISO/IEC 42001. This allows accreditation bodies and peer assessors to assess the competencies of conformity assessment bodies in an efficient and harmonized way and ensures the comparability and reproducibility of certificates confirming conformity with ISO/IEC 42001.

    The requirements contained in this document shall be demonstrated by any body providing AIMS certification.
