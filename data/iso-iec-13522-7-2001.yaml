    1.1 Context of the scope
    ISO/IEC 13522 specifies the coded representation of multimedia/hypermedia information objects (MHEG objects)
    for interchange as final form units within or across services and applications, by any means of interchange
    including local area networks, wide area telecommunication or broadcast networks, storage media, etc.
    ISO/IEC 13522-5:1997 defines the MHEG-5 object classes for interchange and use in base-level applications
    intended to be run on limited resource terminals such as set-top-boxes in such contexts as interactive broadband
    services.
    Annex F of ISO/IEC 13522-5:1997 specifies the features that need to be defined by a specific MHEG-5 application
    domain. The informative annexes of this part of ISO/IEC 13522-5:1997 give illustrative examples of profiles of
    some common application domains.
    1.2 Scope
    MHEG-5 engines are system or application components that handle, interpret and present MHEG-5 objects. The
    scope of this part of ISO/IEC 13522 is to define a test suite that can be used to test an MHEG-5 engine's
    conformance to a specific application domain. It also defines a format for test cases that can be used to extend the
    test suite, either for more detailed testing or for extensions defined by the application domain.
    It is beyond the scope of this part of ISO/IEC 13522 to define tests for engine performance, engine memory usage
    or for MHEG-5 applications that run on these engines.
    This part of the ISO/IEC 13522 specifies test cases for all features of ISO/IEC 13522-5:1997. Application domains
    define a subset of MHEG-5 features that must be supported. In order to test conformance to a specific application
    domain, a corresponding subset of the test cases must be defined. This subset of the test suite is then used to test
    the conformance of the engine.
    This part of ISO/IEC 13522 tests conformance of the behaviour of an MHEG engine. It does not validate the
    physical presentation of MHEG-5 objects.
    The test suite comprises a set of test cases and a corresponding set of test objects. The test cases are defined in
    terms of:
    _ test purpose;
    _ objects and procedures which are to be used to test one or more MHEG-5 features;
    _ expected result.
    ISO/IEC 13522-7:2001(E)
    A set of content data will be provided for the test objects. These content data are intended as a guide for
    generating a test suite and should be converted or replaced by content formats appropriate to the Application
    Domain.
    A test suite for an Application Domain shall be generated by using the PICS template in subclause 9.2.1 PICS
    Template.
