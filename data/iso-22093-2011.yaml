abstract:
- content: |-
    ISO 22093:2011 defines a neutral language for communication between information systems and dimensional measurement equipment (DME), called the Dimensional Measuring Interface Standard (DMIS). DMIS is an execution language for measurement part programs and provides an exchange format for metrology data such as features, tolerances, and measurement results.
    DMIS conveys the product and equipment definitions along with the process and reporting information necessary to perform dimensional measurements that employ coordinate metrology. DMIS contains product definitions for nominal features, feature constructions, dimensional and geometric tolerances, functional datums, and part coordinate systems. It also communicates equipment definitions for various measurement sensors, measurement resources, and machine parameters. DMIS instructs the DME's motions and measurements for product acceptance or verification and for manufacturing process validation and control. Furthermore, DMIS guides the analysis of coordinate data to report and tag measurement results that ascertain product/process quality.
    Finally, to aid in its implementation, application functional subsets of DMIS have been defined that ensure successful interoperability and to validate DMIS conformance. Also, DMIS addresses the associativity of DMIS product definitions with computer aided design (CAD) information.
