  content: ISO/IEC 40180 provides the fundamentals and the reference framework for
    quality assurance, quality management and quality improvement in IT-enhanced learning,
    education and training (called E-Learning). It consists mainly of the Quality
    Reference Framework (QRF) for E-Learning, which is a common and generic framework
    to describe, specify and understand critical properties, characteristics and metrics
    of quality. The QRF combines an elaborated and extensive process model with a
    descriptive model for the processes. ISO/IEC 40180 harmonizes existing approaches,
    concepts, specifications, terms and definitions related to quality for E-Learning,
    education and training.
