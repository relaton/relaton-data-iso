    This document addresses the design and development of fuelling protocols for compressed hydrogen gas dispensing to vehicles with compressed hydrogen storage of fuel.
    The document does not address dispensing of compressed hydrogen gas to vehicles with hydride-based hydrogen storage systems as well as the dispensing of liquefied or cryo-compressed hydrogen.
    This document is intended to be used for a wide range of applications including, but not limited to, the following:
    —    light, medium, and heavy-duty road vehicles,
    —    motor bicycles and tricycles, carts, and trailers,
    —    off-road vehicles,
    —    fork-lift and other industrial trucks,
    —    rail locomotives and powered cars,
    —    airplanes and drones, and
    —    maritime ships, boats, and barges.
    This document applies to a wide spectrum of development situations ranging from companies developing a fuelling protocol for their specific products or applications to standards development organizations (SDOs) developing a consensus-based fuelling protocol for a broad segment of the industrial or commercial market. Additionally, combinations between the two extremes are possible, where, for example, companies start design and development as a way of defining a proposal for new work by an SDO to complete development and publish the document as a consensus-based standard (including technical justification for compliance to this document).
    This document defines requirements for the design and development of the fuelling protocols. These requirements can be integrated into the existing design and development processes to ensure that the fuelling protocol is fully verified and that the generated documentation is sufficient for the proper implementation and safe use of the fuelling protocols in dispensing systems for the targeted application.
    In addition to addressing the design and development of fuelling protocols for general applications, Annex A provides specific requirements and information relative to fuelling protocols for road vehicles at public fuelling stations based on ISO 19880-1.
