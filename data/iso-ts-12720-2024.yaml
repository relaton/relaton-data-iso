    This document provides guidance for the application of the nine general principles of sustainability in buildings and civil engineering works as specified in ISO 15392:2019, 5.3. It shows the different actors involved with the construction works how to take these principles into account in their decision-making processes in order to increase the contribution of the construction works to sustainability and sustainable development.
    This document provides a step-by-step approach for:
    —     encouraging the application of the general principles by all stakeholders at each stage of the project and its use, from the decision to build and the initial development of the project brief until the end-of-life of the construction works;
    —     helping interested parties to consider and/or incorporate sustainability thinking in all phases of the building’s or civil engineering works’ life cycle, for all relevant issues of concern, by raising key questions in relation to the general principles;
    —     understanding the outcome (effect) of the application of the general principles;
    —     building on acquired experience to develop best practices and engendering a continuous improvement process.
