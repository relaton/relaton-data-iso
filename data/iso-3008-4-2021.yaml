    This document specifies a standard test methodology and resulting field of direct application which are applicable to linear joint fire seal materials used to seal around fire door sets which have been tested in accordance with ISO 3008‑1.
    The test methodology described in this document uses a smaller-scale fire resistance furnace than that prescribed in ISO 3008‑1.
