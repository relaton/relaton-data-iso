  content: "This document identifies common failure modes, which can occur within
    operations across additive manufacturing (AM) process categories defined in ISO/ASTM
    52900. It lists state-of-the-art failure modes, which can lead to risks within
    AM parts and equipment, as well as providing informative examples of corresponding
    failure effects and mitigation actions.\nThis document can be used to aid manufacturers
    in their risk management. While doing so it supports the implementation of AM
    as a production method within critical applications and regulated industries.
    This document helps to address the requirements for risk management set by regulated
    industries for part and production method compliance.\nTechnology specific failure
    modes will be addressed in separate standards, including but not limited to PBF-LB/M,
    PBF-LB/P, MEX, MJT, BJT, and DED.\nThis document aims to close the existing gap
    between general risk management standards, such as ISO 31000 or ISO 14971 (medical),
    and the know-how gap of existing failure modes of the AM process category and
    their integrated workflow.\nThe standard maps risks according to AM processes
    defined within ISO/ASTM 52920.\nThis document does not cover environment, health
    and safety risks and will not measure, assess, or evaluate the risk impact on
    the AM part to be produced. It does not list the part specific input and output
    parameters, during the respective process steps. This task is dedicated to the
    risk management evaluation teams, which usually comprise quality managers and
    product domain specific experts.\nThe document enables all part owners and manufacturers
    to use it for the risk mapping activities, to support subsequent risk assessments,
    continuous improvement, validation planning, estimation of manufacturing efforts,
    and conformity audits. \nFor risk examples that are relevant only to specific
    AM machinery brands, manufacturers might consider use of the informative annex."
