    This document defines requirements and specifications of indoor positioning references, which can be referenced for positioning in indoor space, for supporting indoor navigation functionality of a personal/vehicle (P/V) ITS station.
    NOTE          Specific structure and contents of indoor positioning references depend on types of indoor positioning technologies.
    This document defines:
    a)    the composition of an indoor map for indoor navigation of P/V ITS stations;
    b)    the schema and encoding format of the indoor map for indoor navigation at the P/V ITS stations.
    This document focuses on the specification and format of the indoor map. The following issues which are adjunctive but essential for commercial navigation services are beyond the scope of this document:
    —    authorized and authenticated access of users and services, including security;
    —    payment;
    —    preparation of indoor data which are necessary for indoor navigation;
    —    low-level communication protocols required to transfer and share data from and to a roadside ITS station or a central ITS station;
    —    other issues dependent on implementation of an instance of indoor navigation.
