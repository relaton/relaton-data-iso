- content: |-
    This document specifies the minimum performance requirements and methods of test for helmets used for wildland firefighting.
    This document covers the general design of wildland firefighting helmets, the minimum levels of performance for the materials employed and the methods of test used. The personal protection equipment (PPE) is not intended to provide protection during fire entrapment.
    This document does not cover PPE for structural firefighting (see ISO 11999 series), for use against chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear hazards, or for use where a reflective outer surface is required (see ISO 15538).
    Activities in support of wildland firefighting, such as the cutting of trees and the use of a chainsaw can require additional protection to that provided in this document. Users are directed to those relevant standards for the requirements associated with such protection.
