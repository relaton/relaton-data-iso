    This document specifies the requirements and test methods for exterior protection for passenger cars. This document applies to passenger cars.
    The aim is to provide protection at the front and rear of the vehicle, of certain mechanical elements and, above all, for lighting, signals, charging ports and sensors (arranged at the front and rear of the vehicle and including but not limited to those used for automatic driving system, e.g. LiDAR, radar, camera) in cases of collision at low speed.
    Exterior protection is assured by protective devices, which are elements located at the front and rear ends of vehicles and designed in such a way as to allow contacts and small shocks to occur without causing any serious damage.
