    ISO 15500-7:2015 specifies tests and requirements for the gas injector and/or fuel rail, a compressed natural gas fuel system component intended for use on the types of motor vehicles defined in ISO 3833.
    ISO 15500-7:2015 is applicable to vehicles using natural gas in accordance with ISO 15403‑1 (mono-fuel, bi-fuel, or dual-fuel applications). It is not applicable to injectors intended for high-pressure injection to the combustion chamber, or to the following:
    a)    liquefied natural gas (LNG) fuel system components located upstream of, and including, the vaporizer;
    b)    fuel containers;
    c)    stationary gas engines;
    d)    container mounting hardware;
    e)    electronic fuel management;
    f)     refuelling receptacles.
    NOTE 1       It is recognized that miscellaneous components not specifically covered herein can be examined to meet the criteria of this part of ISO 15500 and tested according to the appropriate functional tests.
    NOTE 2       All references to pressure in this part of ISO 15500 are to be considered gauge pressures unless otherwise specified.
    NOTE 3 This part of ISO 15500 is based upon a service pressure for natural gas as fuel of 20 MPa [200 bar[1]] settled at 15 °C. Other service pressures can be accommodated by adjusting the pressure by the appropriate factor (ratio). For example, a 25 MPa (250 bar) service pressure system will require pressures to be multiplied by 1,25.
    [1]     1 bar = 0,1 MPa = 105 Pa 1 MPa = 1 N/mm2
