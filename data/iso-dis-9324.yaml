abstract:
- content: "This document covers, on the basis of the chosen gauge, requirements for
    rolling stock:\n— general principles; \n— various calculation methods applicable
    to the elements shared by the infrastructure and the rolling stock; \n\nThis international
    document is applicable to new designs and modifications of heavy rail vehicles
    running on their associated infrastructure with track gauges of 1435mm or 1520mm
    on the basis of the gauges of the routes of interest. It may also be applied for
    other types of track gauges.\n\nThis international document can also be applied
    for the purpose of the check process of the rolling stock gauges for different
    regions. \nIt does not apply to the transportation of the oversized cargo and
    cargo carried on the open rolling stock, for example platforms for containers.
    In addition, it does not apply to urban transport."
