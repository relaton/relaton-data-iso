abstract:
- content: "ISO 23469:2005 provides guidelines for specifying seismic actions for
    designing geotechnical works, including buried structures (e.g. buried tunnels,
    box culverts, pipelines, and underground storage facilities), foundations (e.g.
    shallow and deep foundations, and underground diaphragm walls), retaining walls
    (e.g. soil retaining and quay walls), pile-supported wharves and piers, earth
    structures (e.g. earth and rockfill dams and embankments), gravity dams, landfill
    and waste sites. \nThe guidelines provided in ISO 23469:2005 are general enough
    to be applicable for both new and existing geotechnical works. However, for use
    in practice, procedures more specific to existing geotechnical works can be needed,
    such as those described for existing structures in ISO 13822."
