    ISO 18479-2:2016, intended to be used together with ISO 18479‑1 and ISO 10896‑1, defines user requirements for rough-terrain trucks when fitted with a non-integrated personnel work platform (PWP) as an attachment. This includes non-integrated PWPs that have a means of being affixed to the truck forks.
    NOTE          National or local requirements can apply, which could be more stringent.
    User requirements for rough-terrain trucks fitted with a personnel work platform having controls which affect travel or movement of the rough-terrain truck are not covered by this part of ISO 18479 (see ISO 18893).
