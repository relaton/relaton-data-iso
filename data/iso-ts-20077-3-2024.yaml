abstract:
- content: |-
    This document describes the process to initiate and facilitate the communication between independent stakeholders and vehicle manufacturers (VMs), whereby service providers (SPs) express the intention to obtain data and functions access from the ExVe interfaces for the purpose of developing services. Data and functions of the vehicle are basic information that are key for the development of services for the vehicle owner, driver, and user. Vehicle data and functions, in this context, comprises onboard, offboard or a combination of the two.
    This document, in conjunction with ISO 20077-1 and ISO 20077-2, describes the full process for the provision of data and functions access from the ExVe interfaces between the SP and the VM.
    All the situations where requested data and functions are dedicated to internal development and design or product quality improvements from the VMs' and suppliers' side, when they are not acting as service providers, are excluded from this document. Also, commercial aspects are out of the scope of this document.
