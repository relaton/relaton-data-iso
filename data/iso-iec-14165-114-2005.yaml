abstract:
- content: Fibre Channel provides a general data transport vehicle for Upper Level
    Protocols (ULPs) such as Intelligent Peripheral Interface (IPI) and Small Computer
    System Interface (SCSI) command sets, the High-Performance Parallel Interface
    (HIPPI) data framing, IP (Internet Protocol), ANSI/IEEE 802.2, and others. This
    part of ISO/IEC 14165, FC-100-DF-EL-S, specifies a Media Dependent Interface for
    duplex Ethernet transmission of 100 MB/s--a physical layer interface for a signalling
    rate of 1 062,5 Mbit/s over two pairs--for operation over Class F balanced cabling
    channels, for up to 100 m of Category 7 balanced (twisted pair) cabling. It includes
    a functional description of an Ethernet physical layer for 100 MB/s transmission
    of low complexity that can easily be implemented by many vendors. Taking advantage
    of the improved transmission characteristics provided by balanced cabling channels
    Class F as specified in ISO/IEC 11801 (2002), it eliminates the need for implementation
    of the complex functions specified in ISO/IEC 8802-3 that cancel the effects of
    crosstalk and return loss. This provides a solution that can operate at a much
    lower power level, and that can be implemented at a lower cost than products that
    use Clause 40 of ISO/IEC 8802-3. Therefore it also has the potential for multiple
    ports per chip.
