    This document provides requirements on the management of waste generated during the operation of inland navigation vessels, including handling, collection, separation, marking, treatment, and storage on board of the vessel. It also describes the ship-to-shore interface and the delivery of waste from the vessel to the reception station.
    Small crafts or vessels can use this document to improve their waste management.
    This document also provides information for segregating and managing waste that any reception station worldwide can expect from inland navigation vessels and concentrates on:
    —     prevention/elimination/minimization of waste prior to sailing;
    —     minimization of waste at the source on the inland vessel;
    —     waste collection at the source;
    —     waste segregation on the inland vessel into defined categories that are recognized globally and fit into any of the different waste categorization systems around the world;
    —     waste minimization once segregated;
    —     waste storage on board the vessel; and
    —     health and safety concerns surrounding the handling, storage, and offloading of waste.
