abstract:
- content: This International Standard specifies the guidelines of the method and
    procedure for determining the effect of temperature on atomic force microscope
    (AFM) nano-scale dimension measurements. The effect of temperature can be evaluated
    by continuously measuring the changes of the X- and Y- pitches and height of a
    two-dimensional (2D) calibration grating in an environmental temperature controllable
    AFM. If necessary, this method and procedure can be used to evaluate the effect
    of temperature on dimension measurement of other scanning probe microscopes(SPMs).
