abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 11770-5:2011 specifies key establishment mechanisms for multiple
    entities to provide procedures for handling cryptographic keying material used
    in symmetric or asymmetric cryptographic algorithms according to the security
    policy in force. \nIt defines the symmetric key based key establishment mechanisms
    for multiple entities with a key distribution centre (KDC), and defines symmetric
    key establishment mechanisms based on general tree based structure with both individual
    rekeying and batched rekeying. It also defines key establishment mechanisms based
    on key chain with both unlimited forward key chain and limited forward key chain.
    Both key establishment mechanisms can be combined by applications.\nISO/IEC 11770-5:2011
    also describes the required content of messages which carry keying material or
    are necessary to set up the conditions under which the keying material can be
    established."
