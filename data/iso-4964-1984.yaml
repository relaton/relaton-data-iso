  content: Specifies conversion bands for hardness scales for Vickers/Brinell (steel
    ball and hardmetal ball), and Vickers/Rockwell (scales A, B, C and D). This conversion
    bands only apply to non-alloy and low-alloy steels for products of homogeneous
    structure and of thickness equal to or greater than the figure given in the relevant
    test standard. In cases of dispute the hardness value obtained from the hardness
    test should be used. Converted hardness values shall not be used as a basis for
    rejection of the steel.
