    ISO 7718-1:2009 specifies minimum requirements for dimensions and unobstructed space around main-deck passenger doors of future types of civil-passenger transport aircraft when they are intended to be compatible with the thousands of passenger boarding bridges and passenger transfer vehicles existing, or being planned, in airports worldwide.
    ISO 7718-1:2009 is not applicable to existing models of civil transport aircraft, or derivative models with the same fuselage, for which the aircraft-mating section of passenger boarding bridges or passenger transfer vehicles is expected to be compatible with ISO 16004.
    ISO 7718-1:2009 is not intended to restrict in any way the basic design of any future types of civil-passenger transport aircraft. However, it aims to clarify for aircraft-design engineers the design characteristics that would make it difficult, or impossible, for a new type of aircraft to connect adequately with existing airport passenger boarding bridges or passenger transfer vehicles.
    If, on a future model, basic aircraft-design requirements impose certain dimensional characteristics that do not comply with ISO 7718-1:2009, one of the following will apply, and in each case, aircraft-handling constraints and operating costs will increase:
    -        alternative methods of embarking/disembarking passengers (e.g. integral aircraft stairs) will need to be implemented; or
    -        existing passenger boarding bridges and/or passenger transfer vehicles will need to be modified/reworked to some extent in the airports where this type of new aircraft will operate; or
    -        additional interface devices/equipment will be needed to connect this type of new aircraft with existing passenger boarding bridges and passenger transfer vehicles.
