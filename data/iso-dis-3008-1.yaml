    This document, used in conjunction with ISO 834-1, specifies a method for determining the fire resistance of door and shutter assemblies designed primarily for installation within openings incorporated in vertical separating elements, such as
    — hinged and pivoted doors,
    — horizontally sliding and vertically sliding doors, including articulated sliding doors and sectional doors,
    — steel single-skin folding shutters (un-insulated),
    — other sliding, folding doors,
    — tilting doors,
    — rolling shutter doors,
    — removable panels in walls,
    — self-closing openable windows.
    Requirements are included for mechanical pre-conditioning, e.g. "cycling" of door and shutter assemblies prior to the conduct of the fire-resistance test.
