    ISO 21009-2:2006 specifies operational requirements for static vacuum insulated vessels designed for a maximum allowable pressure of more than 0,5 bar (50 kPa). It may also be used as a guideline for vessels designed for a maximum allowable pressure of less than 0,5 bar (50 kPa).
    ISO 21009-2:2006 applies to vessels designed for cryogenic fluids specified in EN 13458-1 and EN 13458-2.
    Static cryogenic vessels are often partly equipped by the manufacturer, but may be installed or re-installed by another party, such as the operator, user or owner. For this reason, some of the scope of ISO 21009-2:2006, which includes installation, putting into service, inspection, filling, maintenance and emergency procedure, overlaps with EN 13458-1, EN 13458-2 and EN 13458-3.
