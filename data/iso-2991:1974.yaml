abstract:
- content: Applicable to products containing more than 0.0001 % (m/m) of ammoniacal
    nitrogen. The procedure described is siutable for contents between 0.0001 % (m/m)
    and 0.0005 % (m/m). The principle of the analysis consists in distillation, with
    entrainment by steam, of the ammonia in the presence of an excess of sodium hydroxide
    and collection of the distillate in an excess of acid solution. Neutralization
    of the excess of acid and formation of the coloured complex by treatment with
    sodium phenate and sodium hypochlorite in the presence of acetone. Spectrophotometric
    measurement of the indophenol obtained at a wavelength of about 630 nm. Has also
    been approved by the IUPAC.
