  content: Directed lubrication is an advanced technology that is capable of reducing
    the power loss and improving the performance of tilting pad type bearings. Unlike
    flooded lubrication, where the bearing components remain permanently submerged
    in an oil filled housing, with directed lubrication the components are not submerged
    and the oil is delivered from an external source directly to the working surfaces
    of the tilting pads after which it falls freely away to be drained from the bottom
    of the housing. There are several alternative methods of realising the benefits
    of directed lubrication in tilting pad bearing designs. As an example, this document
    specifies a spray nozzle type directed lubrication system where lubricant is supplied
    to each pad through nozzles mounted between the pads in tilting pad thrust and
    journal bearings. The design concept of this type of lubrication is described.
