  content: The reference method described is applicable to products having total mercury
    contents in the range of about 0.01 % (m/m) to 0.5 % (m/m). May also be extended
    to products with a total content of more than 0.5 % (m/m). The principle of the
    method consists in the combustion of the test portion with oxygen in an enclosed
    system. Reduction of the mercury(II) compounds contained in the resulting solution
    to elementary mercury. Entrainment of the metal in a gas stream at ambient temperature
    and determination as the monoatomic vapour by cold vapour atomic absorption spectrometry
    at a wavelength in the region of 253.7 nm.
