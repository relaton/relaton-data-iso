    This document establishes required practices for the safe use of cranes through implementing a safe system of work consisting of the task planning, selection, erection and dismantling, operation and maintenance of cranes, and the selection of operators, slingers and signallers.
    This document does not cover manually operated (non-powered) cranes, cranes in which at least one of its motions is manually operated and cranes mounted on water-borne vessels, except in those circumstances where a land-based crane is temporarily affixed to a vessel.
