    ISO 23461:2010 specifies a control system for non-conformances related to any product for space systems, such as electrical, electronic, and electromechanical components and software, as well as operational non-conformances and anomalies.
    ISO 23461:2010 applies to all deliverable products and supplies, at all levels, which fail to conform to specification requirements and design baselines.
    ISO 23461:2010 is applicable throughout phases of: a) procurement, production, qualification, integration, and test; b) acceptance, delivery, and transportation; c) launch preparation and flight or launch readiness; d) operational validation or qualification; e) operation; f) refurbishment.
    ISO 23461:2010 also specifies requirements for the interfaces with company internal non-conformance reporting and processing.
    Engineering changes lie outside the scope of ISO 23461:2010.
