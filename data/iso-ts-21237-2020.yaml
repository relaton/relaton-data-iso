- content: |-
    This document specifies the characteristics to be measured of air filter media containing polymeric nanofibres on the surfaces of a substrate. It also describes measurement methods for determining the individual characteristics.
    This document does not cover characteristics specific for health and safety issues.
    NOTE    The properties/performances assessment of air filter media related to applications requires the use of relevant published standards. The physical properties and performances of filtration media, such as pressure drop, and the particle removal efficiency of air filter media are measured with test methods suitable for specific applications.
