    This document covers additively manufactured stainless steel components using full-melt powder bed fusion such as electron beam melting and laser melting. The components produced by these processes are used typically in applications that require mechanical properties similar to machined forgings and wrought products. Components manufactured to this specification are often, but not necessarily, post processed via machining, grinding, electrical discharge machining (EDM), polishing, and so forth to achieve desired surface finish and critical dimensions.
    This document is intended for the use of mechanical engineers to size equipment, purchasers or producers, of additively manufactured components for defining the requirements and ensuring component properties.
    This document does not purport to address all of the safety concerns, if any, associated with its use. It is the responsibility of the user of this document to establish appropriate safety, health, and environmental practices and determine the applicability of regulatory limitations prior to use.
