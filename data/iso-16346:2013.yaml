    ISO 16346:2013 defines the general procedures to assess the energy performance of buildings, including technical building systems, and defines the different types of ratings, and the building boundaries.
    The purpose of ISO 16346:2013 is to
    a)    collate results from other International Standards that calculate energy use for specific services within a building,
    b)    account for energy generated in the building, some of which may be exported for use elsewhere,
    c)    present a summary of the overall energy use of the building in tabular form,
    d)    provide energy ratings based on primary energy, carbon dioxide emission, or other parameters defined by a national energy policy, and
    e)    establish general principles for the calculation of primary energy factors and carbon dioxide emission coefficients.
    ISO 16346:2013 defines the energy services to be taken into account for setting energy performance ratings for planned and existing buildings and provides for
    1)    a method to compute the standard calculated energy rating, a standard energy use that does not depend on occupant behaviour, actual weather, and other actual (environment or indoor) conditions,
    2)    a method to assess the measured energy rating, based on the delivered and exported energy,
    3)    a method to improve confidence in the building calculation model by comparison with actual energy use, and
    4)    a method to assess the energy effectiveness of possible improvements.
    ISO 16346:2013 is applicable to a part of a building (e.g. flat), a whole building, or several buildings.
