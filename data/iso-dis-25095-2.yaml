abstract:
- content: "This document specifies the test method for the determination of aldehydes
    in propylene oxide for industrial use by high performance liquid chromatography.
    \nThis document is applicable to the determination of the four aldehydes in industrial
    propylene oxide, including formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, propionaldehyde, acrolein.
    The concentration ranges from 1 mg/kg to 100 mg/kg, and the content of total aldehydes
    in industrial propylene oxide is the sum of these four aldehydes."
