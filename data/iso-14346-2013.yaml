abstract:
- content: ISO 14346:2013 gives guidelines for the design and analysis of welded uniplanar
    and multiplanar joints in lattice structures composed of circular (CHS), square
    (SHS) or rectangular (RHS) hollow sections, and of uniplanar joints in lattice
    structures composed of combinations of hollow sections with open sections under
    static loading. ISO 14346:2013 is applicable to CHS or RHS Y-, X- and K-joints
    and their multiplanar equivalents, gusset plate to CHS or RHS joints, open-section
    and RHS to CHS joints, and hollow-section to open-section joints.
