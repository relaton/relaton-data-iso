    This document specifies the methods of calculation of the load capacity of bevel gears, the formulae and symbols used for calculation, and the general factors influencing load conditions.
    The formulae in this document are intended to establish uniformly acceptable methods for calculating the load-carrying capacity of straight, helical (skew), spiral bevel, Zerol and hypoid gears. They are applicable equally to tapered depth and uniform depth teeth. Hereinafter, the term “bevel gear” refers to all of the gear types; if not, the specific forms are identified.
    The formulae in this document take into account the known major factors influencing load-carrying capacity. The rating formulae are only applicable to types of gear tooth deterioration, that are specifically addressed in the individual parts of the ISO 10300 series. Rating systems for a particular type of bevel gears can be established by selecting proper values for the factors used in the general formulae.
    NOTE            This document is not applicable to bevel gears which have an inadequate contact pattern under load (see Annex D).
    The rating system of this document is based on virtual cylindrical gears and restricted to bevel gears whose virtual cylindrical gears have transverse contact ratios of εvα < 2. Additionally, for bevel gears the sum of profile shift coefficients of pinion and wheel is zero (see ISO 23509).
    The user is cautioned that when the formulae are used for large average mean spiral angles (βm1 + βm2)/2 > 45°, for effective pressure angles αe > 30° and/or for large facewidths b > 13 mmn, the calculated results of this document should be confirmed by experience.
