abstract:
- content: "It is recognized that small vessels, often made of glass reinforced plastic
    (GRP), can be poor reflectors of radar signals. In situations where radar is the
    prime observation tool used by ships at sea the International Maritime Organization
    considers that it is essential that small vessels, considered in this context
    to be those under 150 gross tonnage, be equipped with a radar reflector to enhance
    their radar return and thus to improve their visibility to radar.\nISO 8729 specifies
    the minimum requirements for a radar reflector intended to enhance returns from
    small vessels as required by IMO Resolution MSC. 164(78).\nThere are two types
    of radar reflector: passive and active. Passive reflectors are mechanical, whereas
    active reflectors have an electronic element. \nISO 8729-1:2010 concerns passive
    reflectors and gives specifications for the construction, performance, testing,
    inspection and installation of such radar reflectors."
