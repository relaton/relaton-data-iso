    This document specifies requirements and guidance for aluminium shore gangways.
    This document applies to gangways designed to be carried on board ships, to provide a lightweight, convenient and safe means of access from ship to shore, for use primarily by the ship’s crew. These gangways can also be used for access from ship to ship when conditions are favourable.
    The gangways to which this document applies are not intended to carry wheeled traffic such as loaded trolleys.
