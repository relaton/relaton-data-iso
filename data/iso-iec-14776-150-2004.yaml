    The SCSI protocol is designed to provide an efficient peer-to-peer I/O bus with the maximum number of hosts and peripherals determined by the bus width (8 or 16). Data may be transferred asynchronously or synchronously at rates that depend primarily on device implementation and cable length.  SCSI is an I/O interface that may be operated over a wide range of media and transfer rates.

    This international standard specifies the functional requirements for the Serial Attached SCSI (SAS) physical interconnect, which is compatible with the Serial ATA physical interconnect. It also specifies three transport protocols, one to transport SCSI commands, another to transport Serial ATA commands to multiple SATA devices, and a third to support interface management. This standard is intended to be used in conjunctionwith SCSI and ATA command set standards.
