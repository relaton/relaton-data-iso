  content: These products are similar to petroleum products; many sampling procedures
    used for petroleum products are equally applicable to the former. Specifies the
    obtaining of samples from fixed tanks, railcars, road vehicles, barges and drums
    and from liquids being pumped in pipelines. The samples are intended to be used
    determine quality, for testing whether contaminants are present and for the determination
    of the degree of homogeneity of a batch. General recommendation and specific recommendations
    for hazardous, flammable and toxic substances are given and also the treatment
    of mobile liquids at low ambient temperatures is indicated.
