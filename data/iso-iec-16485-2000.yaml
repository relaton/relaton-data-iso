    This Recommendation defines a means to efficiently represent raster-oriented pages that contain a
    mixture of multi-level and bi-level images. Any of the many ITU-T recommended encoding schemes,
    such as T.81 (JPEG) for the encoding of multi-level images and T.6 (MMR) for the encoding of bi-level
    images, may be combined within the context of this Recommendation. Similarly, ITU-T spatial and
    colour resolutions may be combined within a page. This Recommendation does not define new encodings
    or resolutions. The method of image segmentation is beyond the scope of this Recommendation,
    segmentation is left to manufacturers' implementation.
