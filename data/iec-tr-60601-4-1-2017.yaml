    IEC TR 60601-4-1:2017(E) is intended to help a manufacturer through the key decisions and steps to be taken to perform a detailed risk management and usability engineering processes for medical electrical equipment or a medical electrical system, hereafter referred to as MEE or MES, employing a degree of autonomy (DOA).
    This document provides a definition of DOA of MEE or MES and a medical robot, and also provides guidance on:
    - methodologies to perform the risk management process and usability engineering for an MEE or MES with a DOA;
    - considerations of basic safety and essential performance for an MEE and MES with a DOA; and
    - identifying the use of DOA, and similar concepts in existing ISO/IEC standards dealing with MEE or MES with the goal to facilitate alignment of standards by consistent use of the concept of DOA; and
    - distinguishing between medical robots, and other MEE and MES.
    Unless specified otherwise, this document considers MEE and MES together.
    The manufacturer of an MEE or MES with a DOA is expected to design and manufacture an MEE or MES that fulfils its intended use and does not have unacceptable risk throughout its life-cycle.
    This document provides guidance to help the manufacturer in complying with the requirements of IEC 60601-1:2005 and IEC 60601-1:2005/AMD1:2012 for MEE and MES with DOA. The document is also intended as guidance for future standard writers.
    There are no prerequisites to this document.
