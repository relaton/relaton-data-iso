    This document specifies a test method to measure the formaldehyde concentrations in air from wood products under defined test conditions of temperature and relative humidity. Results obtained from this small-scale chamber test method are often used for quality assurance and can be comparable to, or can provide useful correlations to, results obtained from testing larger product samples in larger chamber test methods for wood products, such as the 1 m3 chamber method specified in ISO 12460-1.
    NOTE 1    This document is based on the general principles and methods of ASTM D 6007.
    NOTE 2    ISO 12460-1 for the 1 m3 chamber is the reference method for the determination of formaldehyde release. For factory production control the derived test methods according to this document, ISO 12460-3, ISO 12460-4 and ISO 12460-5 are used.
