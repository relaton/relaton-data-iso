    ISO/TR 21136:2017 provides a review of key floor vibration design criteria (human acceptability criterion using calculated parameters) developed in research studies on timber floor around the world over the last 30 years. Associated design methods are provided in the Annexes. The methods proposed in this report are intended to be used for establishing human acceptability criteria for timber floor vibrations induced by walking activities.
    The proposed methods are applicable to the following timber floors: lightweight floors made of timber joists and thin wood panel subfloor, heavy timber floors made of heavy timber beams with a thick timber deck, and mass timber slab floors such as cross laminated timber (CLT), nail laminated timber (NLT) and glued laminated timber.
