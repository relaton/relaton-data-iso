  content: ISO/TS 18083|IDF/RM 51:2013 specifies the calculation of the approximate
    content of phosphorus from added phosphate salts and phosphorus containing pH-regulating
    agents in processed cheese products. The method is applicable to processed cheese
    products derived mainly from cheese varieties with a P/N ratio of 0,12 ± 0,02
    and containing no ingredients in quantities substantially affecting the P/N ratio
    of the cheese raw material.
