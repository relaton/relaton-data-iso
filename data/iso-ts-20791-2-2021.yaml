    This document describes the procedures for evaluation of colour variation in the printing of photographic reflection colour prints. The following procedures are described to evaluate colour variation in printing within a consecutive print job, between several print jobs, or between multiple photographic images printed in different areas of a large sheet:
    a) test targets for small and large photographic prints;
    b) printing procedures and conditions;
    c) sampling in correspondence to the production scale;
    d) measurement of colour;
    e) calculation and analysis of colour variation and
    f) reporting.
    The procedures presented in this document are applicable for prints with a size of available picture area ranging from 35 cm2 (e.g. 5 cm × 7 cm) to 5 400 cm2 (e.g. 60 cm × 90 cm). This document is applicable to any of the photographic printing technologies, including inkjet, thermal dye transfer, electrophotography and silver halide (chromogenic) technologies.
