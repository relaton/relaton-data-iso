abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: ISO/IEC 29341-1:2011(E) Defines UPnP technology which describes an architecture
    for pervasive peer-to-peer network connectivity of intelligent appliances, wireless
    devices, and PCs of all form factors. It is designed to bring easy-to-use, flexible,
    standards-based connectivity to ad-hoc or unmanaged networks whether in the home,
    in a small business, public spaces, or attached to the Internet. UPnP technology
    provides a distributed, open networking architecture that leverages TCP/IP and
    the Web technologies to enable seamless proximity networking in addition to control
    and data transfer among networked devices. The UPnP Device Architecture (UDA)
    is designed to support zero-configuration, "invisible" networking, and automatic
    discovery for a breadth of device categories from a wide range of vendors. A device
    can dynamically join a network, obtain an IP address, convey its capabilities,
    and learn about the presence and capabilities of other devices. Finally, a device
    can leave a network smoothly and automatically without leaving any unwanted state
    behind. The technologies leveraged in the UPnP architecture include Internet protocols
    such as IP, TCP, UDP, HTTP, and XML. Like the Internet, contracts are based on
    wire protocols that are declarative, expressed in XML, and communicated via HTTP.
    This International Standard replaces ISO/IEC 29341-1, first edition, published
    in 2008, and constitutes a technical revision.
