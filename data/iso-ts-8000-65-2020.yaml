    This document specifies a questionnaire to audit the performance of the processes specified by the process reference model in ISO 8000‑61.
    NOTE 1  This questionnaire is applicable to all types of business process, technology, information system, data and data processing. This questionnaire can be used as part of a continuous improvement process.
    The following are within the scope of this document:
    —     guiding principles for generating questions from the process outcomes specified by ISO 8000‑61;
    —     one or more questions for each outcome of every process in ISO 8000‑61;
    —     a measurement method based on a simple indicator and measurement scale for each question;
    —     guidance on how to present the results generated by the questionnaire.
    NOTE 2  The questions and corresponding indicators in this document conform to the requirements of ISO 8000‑63.
    The following is outside the scope of this document:
    —     defining how the questions relate to models of organizational process maturity.
    NOTE 3  Such models define an overall scale by which to understand the degree to which an organization is performing effectively and efficiently.
    EXAMPLE    ISO 8000‑62 and ISO 8000‑64 [1]specify how to use maturity models with ISO 8000‑61.
    [1] Under preparation.
