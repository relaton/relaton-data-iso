abstract:
- content: |-
    This document identifies existing global smart community infrastructures that enhance disaster risk reduction, the key purposes served by these global examples, gaps in coverage, and the need for standardization activities, which establishes the basis for the next steps for standardization.
    This document is intended to be a basis for the future standardization of smart community infrastructures for disaster risk reduction through the identification of areas for potential standardization. This includes, but is not limited to, infrastructures related to energy, waste and water, transportation, information and communication technologies (ICT), and the general built environment.
    It does not address specifications or requirements already covered by other relevant international standards.
    This document primarily addresses disasters caused by natural hazards, such as geological and hydrometeorological hazards, and does not focus on human-induced disasters such as terrorism or biological hazards such as pandemics.
