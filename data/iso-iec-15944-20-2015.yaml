    ISO/IEC 15944-20:2015 specifies the properties of Base Functional Specification View (FSV) Standards in order to best meet the requirements of the Business Operational View (BOV) with interoperable implementations. Base FSV standards exhibiting these properties support business transactions beyond those that are in compliance with Open-edi scenarios (OeS). Additional beneficial business transactions may also be supported between a given IT system and IT system(s) outside of the Open-edi scenarios for which they were designed.
    These base FSV standards address those aspects of interoperability between IT systems used among Parties of the Open-edi Community participating in the scenario. Examples of such standards include the choreography of interchanges among systems, and the foundational structure and syntax used to express Information Bundles (IB) in the interchanges.
