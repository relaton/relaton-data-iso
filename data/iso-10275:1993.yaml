  content: The principle of the test method specified is subjecting a test piece to
    uniaxial tensile strain at a prescribed constant rate within the region of uniform
    plastic strain. It is valid only for that part of the stress-strain curve in the
    plastic range where the curve is continuous and monotonic. The tensile strain
    hardening exponent is calculated either by considering a portion of the stress-strain
    curve in the plastic strain region, or by considering the whole of the uniform
    plastic strain region.
