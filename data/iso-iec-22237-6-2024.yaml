- content: |-
    This document specifies requirements and recommendations concerning the physical security of data centres based on the criteria and classifications for “availability”, “security” and “energy efficiency enablement” within ISO/IEC 22237-1.
    This document provides designations for the data centre spaces defined in ISO/IEC 22237-1.
    This document specifies requirements and recommendations for such data centre spaces, and the systems employed within those spaces, in relation to protection against:
    a)       unauthorized access addressing organizational and technological solutions;
    b)       intrusion;
    c)        internal fire events igniting within data centre spaces;
    d)       internal environmental events (other than fire) within the data centre spaces which would affect the defined level of protection;
    e)       external environmental events outside the data centre spaces which would affect the defined level of protection.
    NOTE          Constructional requirements and recommendations are provided by reference to ISO/IEC 22237-2.
    Safety and electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) requirements are outside the scope of this document and are covered by other standards and regulations. However, information given in this document can be of assistance in meeting these standards and regulations.
    Conformance of data centres to the present document is covered in Clause 4.
