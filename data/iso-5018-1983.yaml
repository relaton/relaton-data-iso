  content: Establishes a method for measuring the true density of refractory products
    and raw materials. It is defined as the ratio of the mass of a quantity of dried
    material to its true volume and is calculated from the expression is the density
    of the liquid used at the temperature of the thermostatically controlled bath,
    and m1, m2, m3 are the masses determined in accordance with clause 7.
