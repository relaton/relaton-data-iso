    This document establishes verification procedures to determine the accuracy, speed of response, and stability of temperature measurement for materials testing equipment. These procedures are specified for the expected use in fatigue tests on metals where these characteristics are important to the fidelity of tests at high or varying temperature.
    The principles set out include sufficient provision for both contacting and non-contacting methods of temperature measurement.
    This document is for the end-to-end verification of registered value compared with “true” specimen temperature at the point of measurement. It cannot be used to specify the correct method or location of measurement.
    NOTE: The methodologies could be found applicable to test types beyond mechanical fatigue of metals, but that is outside the remit of this document.
