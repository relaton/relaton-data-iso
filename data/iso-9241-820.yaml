abstract:
- content: "This document identifies ergonomic / human-systems issues and guidance
    for the development and use of systems involving immersive environments, augmented
    reality, and virtual reality. This includes:\na)\tenvironments where the user
    is provided a perception of being physically present in a virtually created world;\nb)\tenvironments
    involving artificial reality, augmented reality, virtual reality, mixed reality,
    and similar simulated realities;\nc)\tcomputer generated environments where the
    user interacts with simulated objects in manners similar to how the user would
    interact with the real-world counter-parts of these objects.\n\nThis document
    is not an exploration of the philosophical, ethical or political issues surrounding
    the use of immersive environments. \n\nThis document limits its treatment of the
    technologies used to create immersive environments to focusing on their interactions
    with users and does not investigate other aspects of these technologies.\n\nThe
    target audience for this document is decision-makers, designers and engineers
    who would benefit from the consideration of human-systems issues of immersive
    environments. Futurists, researchers, technology developers, regulators and legislators
    might also find the document useful."
