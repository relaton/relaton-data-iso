    ISO 20140-1:2013 establishes an overview and general principles of a method for the assessment of environmental influence of manufacturing systems.
    ISO 20140 specifies for the discrete products/parts manufacturing sectors a common foundation and methodology for energy efficiency and other factors of environmental influence evaluation, which enables sector specific methods to be applied in characteristic situations.
    ISO 20140 enables an assessment to be made of the environmental influence of manufacturing processes, which can be used either to seek an overall reduction in negative influence or an increase in positive results.
    The evaluation method of ISO 20140 is applicable to the environmental influence of a manufacturing system which consists of individual manufacturing equipment, and which is configured as a work unit, a work centre, an area or a factory.
    ISO 20140 specifies the requirements for the environmental influence data to be captured from the individual manufacturing equipment, as the most granular data for aggregating along the manufacturing system hierarchy.
    The following are outside the scope of ISO 20140:
    - the environmental influence evaluation methodology of systems outside the manufacturing system boundaries (e.g. other systems of the same site or other systems of the entire enterprise);
    - the environmental influence evaluation methodology to handle the complete product life cycle;
    - the method and data for environmental evaluation which are specific to a particular industry sector, manufacturer, or machinery.
