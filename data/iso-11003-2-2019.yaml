    This document specifies a test method for determining the shear behaviour of an adhesive in a single lap joint bonded assembly when subjected to a tensile force.
    The test is performed on specimens consisting of thick, rigid adherends, with a short length of overlap, in order to obtain the most uniform distribution of shear stresses possible and to minimize other stress states which initiate failure.
    This test method may be used to determine:
    —          the shear-stress against shear-strain curve to failure of the adhesive;
    —           the shear modulus of the adhesive;
    —           other adhesive properties that can be derived from the stress/strain curve such as secant shear modulus and maximum shear stress;
    —          the effect of temperature, environment, test speed, etc., on these properties.
    This document does not apply in case of adhesion failure.
