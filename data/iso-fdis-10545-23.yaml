    This document specifies a testing method for determining the elastic modulus of glazed and unglazed ceramic tiles and also the modulus of glaze layer at ambient temperature by three-point bending tests. Procedures for test piece preparation, test modes and load rates, data collection and reporting are given.
    This test method can be used for material research, quality control, characterization and design data-generation purposes.
