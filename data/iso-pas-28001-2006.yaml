abstract:
- content: "ISO/PAS 28001:2006 provides requirements and guidance for organizations
    in international supply chains to\n- develop and implement supply chain security
    processes; \n- establish and document a minimum level of security within a supply
    chain(s) or segment of a supply chain;\n- assist in meeting the applicable Authorized
    Economic Operators criteria set forth in the World Customs Organization Framework
    of Standards and conforming national supply chain security programmes. \nNOTE
    Only a participating National Customs Agency can designate organizations as Authorized
    Economic Operators in accordance with its supply chain security programme and
    its attendant certification and validation requirements. \nIn addition, ISO/PAS
    28001:2006 establishes certain documentation requirements that would permit verification.\nUsers
    of ISO/PAS 28001:2006 will\n- define the portion of an international supply chain
    within which they have established security (see 4.1);\n- conduct security vulnerability
    assessments on that portion of the supply chain and develop adequate countermeasures;
    \n- develop and implement a supply chain security plan;\n- train security personnel
    in their security related duties."
