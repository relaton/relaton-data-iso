  content: "This document reviews approaches for processing and coding of HDR/WCG
    video content. The purpose of this document is to provide a set of publicly-referenceable
    methods for the operation of AVC or HEVC video coding systems adapted for compressing
    HDR/WCG video for consumer distribution applications. \nThis document first includes
    a review of the video usability information (VUI) indicators and supplemental
    enhancement information (SEI) messages applicable for HDR/WCG video. It provides
    a description of processing steps for converting from 4:4:4 RGB linear light representation
    video signals into video signals with ICTCP colour representation and perceptual
    quantizer (PQ) transfer function, or with Y′CbCr colour representation and HLG
    transfer function (ICTCP, PQ and HLG are defined in Rec. ITU-R BT.2100-1). Some
    high-level approaches for compressing these signals using either Rec. ITU-T H.264
    | ISO/IEC 14496-10 or Rec. ITU-T H.265 | ISO/IEC 23008-2 are provided. A description
    of post-decoding processing steps is also included for converting back to a linear
    light, 4:4:4 RGB representation. The document also addresses the standard dynamic
    range (SDR) backward compatibility, that is, the compatibility with legacy decoding
    systems that are not able to detect and properly display HDR/WCG video content.
    It describes example implementations of this feature using three different solutions:
    using HLG as a backward compatible transfer function, using CRI and TMI SEI messages,
    using dual-layer approach with the Scalable Main 10 profile of HEVC and an SDR
    compatible base layer. Finally, the document illustrates the usage of CRI SEI
    messages to convey metadata enabling the dynamic range and colour gamut adaptation
    at the display side of the decoded video to the display capabilities.\nNOTE       The
    document complements the material provided in ITU-T H.Sup15 | ISO/IEC TR 23008-14,
    which is focused on conversion and coding practices for non-constant luminance
    (NCL) Y′CbCr video signals using the PQ transfer function."
