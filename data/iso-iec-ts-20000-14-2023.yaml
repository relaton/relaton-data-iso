    This document provides guidance for organizations that are establishing or improving a service management system (SMS) by incorporating a service integrator. The incorporation of a service integrator is aimed at addressing an environment that includes services sourced from multiple service providers.
    This document specifically focuses on Service Integration and Management (SIAM) in the context of an SMS.
    The intended users of this document include:
    —     organizations that need to manage multiple service providers within a new or existing SMS according to SIAM; and
    —     consultants and advisors that support an organization during SMS implementation or improvement, where a SIAM approach is being adopted.
    NOTE 1       This document is applicable for organizations implementing SIAM in conjunction with SMS. It does not limit organizations or individuals from implementing any other management and governance model for managing multivendor environments along with SMS.
    This document is not applicable to organizations that have only one service provider.
    NOTE 2       In SIAM, the term "supplier" is not used. Internal and external suppliers are both referred to as “service providers”. See 4.2 for further comparison of terminology.
