    ISO/IEC TR 19446:2015 is applicable to driving licences which include a microchip and claim compliance to the EU Regulation on driving licences.
    ISO/IEC TR 19446:2015 proposes:
    -      details that are missing for the implementation of Commission Regulation (EU) No 383/2012 Annex II item 1 ? 10;
    -      the subset of the ISO/IEC 18013‑4:2011 test methods that are applicable to Commission Regulation (EU) No 383/2012 Annex II item 12;
    -      further test methods that are applicable to Commission Regulation (EU) No 383/2012 Annex II item 12; these test methods are due to EU driving licence requirements that are incompatible with ISO/IEC 18013‑2:2008.
    The following Commission Regulation (EU) No 383/2012 Annex II requirements are out of the scope of this Technical Report:
    -      item 11 extended access restriction ? EAC;
    -      item 13: requirements on the security certificate;
    -      item 14 functional certificate - smart card testing according to the ISO/IEC 10373‑ series.
