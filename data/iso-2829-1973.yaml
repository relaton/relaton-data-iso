abstract:
- content: Applicable to products having phosphorus contents of more than 0.0005 %
    (m/m). Preparation of a solution from a test portion by alkaline fusion either
    with a mixture of sodium carbonate and borid or of sodium carbonate and sodium
    tetraborate. Dissolution of the cooled molten mass in nitric acid and adjustment
    of an appropriate aliquot portion to pH 2. Formation of a phosphomolybdic complex
    and extraction by 2-methylpropan-1-ol in a sulphuric acid medium. Reduction of
    the complex by thin(II) chloride in the organic phase and spectrophotometric measurement
    of the reduced complex at a wavelength of about 730 nm. Has also been approved
    by the IUPAC.
