    ISO 15371:2015 applies to the design, testing, and operation of pre-engineered fire extinguishing systems to protect the galley hoods, ducts, fryers and other grease-laden appliances.
    Pre-engineered fire-extinguishing system units are also required to comply with requirements for the construction and components performance as applicable to specific types, designs, sizes and arrangements. ISO 15371:2015 also provides minimum requirements for the testing and evaluation of components.
