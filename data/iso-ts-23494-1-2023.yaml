  content: "This document specifies a general concept for a provenance information
    model for biological material and data and requirements for provenance data interoperability
    and serialization.\nThe provenance information model covers any information relevant
    to the quality and fitness for purpose of the biological material generated throughout
    the preanalytical phase of the materials life cycle from collection to analysis,
    data originating from analytical procedures applied to the biological material
    and results from further mathematical processing of the data.\nThis document is
    applicable to organizations, authorities and industries that are:\na)    collecting,
    processing or distributing biological material for research; \nb)    generating,
    collecting, analysing or storing data on biological material.\nThis document does
    not apply to biological material and data used for other than research or in fields
    that are regulated by national, regional or international laws, such as medical
    diagnosis and therapy or food production.\nNOTE       International, national,
    or regional regulations or requirements can also apply to specific topics covered
    in this document."
