    ISO 13469:2014 specifies the requirements for the testing procedures for interference-fit/form-fit blind rivet joints and lock bolt joints made of metallicand non-metallic materials. The tests required for a particular joint depend upon the performance requirements of the component/assembly and shall be established before any testing is undertaken.
    The term sheet as used in ISO 13469:2014 includes extrusions, cast material, plastics, and fibre-reinforced plastics, e. g. carbon and glass fibre-reinforced plastics.
    ISO 13469:2014 does not apply to civil engineering applications such as metal building and steel construction which are covered by other applicable International Standards.
