    Fibre Channel provides a general data transport vehicle for Upper Level Protocols (ULPs) such as Intelligent Peripheral Interface (IPI) and Small Computer System Interface (SCSI) command sets, the High-Performance Parallel Interface (HIPPI) data framing, IP (Internet Protocol) and others.
    This International Standard features the basic fibre channel services introduced into Framing and Signalling (FC-FS). In addition, it describes any ancillary functions and services required to support the Fibre Channel services, such as name, management, discovery, time and alias services.
