    This document provides guidelines for the design, construction, and inspection of concrete-filled steel tubular (CFST) hybrid structures. These structures can be used as main structural components like columns, girders, piers, or arches in buildings, bridges, especially in high-rise structures, long-span spatial structures, and large-scale bridges.
    CFST hybrid structures can employ CFST members with a circular cross-section as their chords, and they can also use square or rectangular CFST chords.
