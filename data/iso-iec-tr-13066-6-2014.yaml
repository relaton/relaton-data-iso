abstract:
- content: |-
    ISO/IEC TR 13066-6:2014 provides an overview to the structure and terminology of the Java accessibility application programming interface (API) It will provide:
    - A description of the overall architecture and terminology of the API;
    - Further introductory explanations regarding the content and use of the API beyond those found in Annex A of ISO/IEC 13066-1;
    - An overview of the main properties, including of:

    user interface elements;
    how to get and set focus;
    of communication mechanisms in the API;
    a discussion of design considerations for the API (e.g. pointers to external sources of information on accessibility guidance related to using the API);
    information on extending the API (and where this is appropriate);
    an introduction to the programming interface of the API (including pointers to external sources of information);
    an introduction to the Java Access Bridge for Windows and the Java Access Bridge for GNOME.


    It will provide this information as an introduction to the Java API to assist:
    - IT system level developers who create custom controls and/or interface to them;
    - AT developers involved in programming "hardware to software" and "software to software" interactions.
