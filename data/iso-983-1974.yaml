- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: Specifies a method that is more sensitive and more widely used than the
    2,2'-bipyridyl method. It is applicable to products having iron contents equal
    to or greater than 0.5 mg/kg. The principle is based on the reduction of trivalent
    iron by hydroxylammonium chloride, formation of a bivalent iron/1,10-phenanthroline
    complex in a buffered system. Photometric measurement of the coloured complex
    at a wavelength of about 510 nm. This method has also been approved by the IUPAC.
    - Cancels and replaces ISO Recommendation R 983-1969.
