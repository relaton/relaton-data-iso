abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 12207:2008 establishes a common framework for software life cycle
    processes, with well-defined terminology, that can be referenced by the software
    industry. It contains processes, activities, and tasks that are to be applied
    during the acquisition of a software product or service and during the supply,
    development, operation, maintenance and disposal of software products. Software
    includes the software portion of firmware. \nISO/IEC 12207:2008 applies to the
    acquisition of systems and software products and services, to the supply, development,
    operation, maintenance, and disposal of software products and the software portion
    of a system, whether performed internally or externally to an organization. Those
    aspects of system definition needed to provide the context for software products
    and services are included. \nISO/IEC 12207:2008 also provides a process that can
    be employed for defining, controlling, and improving software life cycle processes.
    \nThe processes, activities and tasks of ISO/IEC 12207:2008 - either alone or
    in conjunction with ISO/IEC 15288 - may also be applied during the acquisition
    of a system that contains software."
