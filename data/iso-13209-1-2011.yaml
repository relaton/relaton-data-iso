    1 Scope
    This part of ISO 13209 specifies a standardized, tester-independent, XML-based data exchange format for the  documentation  and  formal  description  of  diagnostic  test  sequences.  The  format  serves  to  support  the  requirements  of  transferring  diagnostic-test-sequence  logic  between  electronic  system  suppliers,  vehicle manufacturers and service dealerships/repair shops.
    This part of ISO 13209 provides an introduction to the rationale behind ISO 13209. It gives an overview of the document set and structure along with the use case definitions and a common set of resources (definitions, references) for use by all subsequent parts.
