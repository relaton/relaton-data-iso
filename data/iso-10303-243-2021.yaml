    This document specifies the use of the integrated resources necessary for the scope and information requirements for modelling and simulation information in a collaborative systems engineering context (MoSSEC).
    The following are within the scope of this document:
    - the representation of the collaborative understanding of the requirements and their verification;
    - the representation of the elements that together comprise a set of "results" for a study including the audit-trail of what is to be done, and what has been done, and evolution;
    - the representation of the definitions of models and key values that are part of the modelling;
    - the representation of information concerning organization and person in those organizations;
    - the representation of properties and documents;
    - the representation of a collaborative package of work that is launched to drive the evolution and maturity of something;
    - the identification of a breakdown of something, the identification of the elements that comprise a breakdown, the parent-child relationships between breakdown elements and the identification of relationships between elements in different breakdowns;
    - the representation of interfaces including connections, ports and definitions;
    - the identification of which breakdowns, interfaces and models are included in an architecture;
    - the representation of key values as distributions enabling the representation of uncertainties;
    - the representation of justifications, assumptions and approvals to aid and record decision making;
    - the representation of information used for security and trust so each organization is then to be able to enforce their own human resources and security policies.
    NOTE 1 A discussion and illustration of the scope is provided in Annex G
    The following are outside the scope of this document:
    - the detailed format and content of the modelling and simulation data;
    NOTE 2 ISO 10303-243 is agnostic of the type of modelling and simulation and the subsequent model data.

    - specific business processes.
