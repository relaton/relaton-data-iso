    This document describes the core services and roles and responsibilities models in the "mobility as a service" (MaaS) and "mobility on demand" (MOD) ecosystems. The description is based on a literature review of the references listed in the Bibliography.
    This document also includes a comparison of the basic services and roles and responsibilities in order to map any similarities that can potentially be used for bridging and merging the two mainstream concepts in integrated mobility, i.e. MaaS and MOD.
