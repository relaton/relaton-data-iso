abstract:
- content: "ISO 17115:2007 defines a set of basic concepts required to describe formal
    concept representation systems, especially for health sciences, and describes
    representation of concepts and characteristics, for use especially in formal computer-based
    concept representation systems. A main motivation is to make it possible to precisely
    describe content models described in other International Standards. \nISO 17115:2007
    does not include enumeration of axiomatic concepts and semantic links, or detailed
    content of health terminology systems (classifications, nomenclatures or reference
    terminology of health concepts). "
