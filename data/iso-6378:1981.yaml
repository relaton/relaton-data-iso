  content: Covers a method based on the selection of a gas chromatography column allowing
    the separation of the impurities to be determined. A gaseous test portion is passed
    through this column and the peaks obtained are detected by flame ionization and
    compared with those derived from an external standard. Columns and operating conditions
    having been found suitable for such a test are indicated in Annex A while Annex
    B lists the absolute retention times with regard to the analysis of butadiene.
    Annex C includes a typical chromatogram from a Sebaconitrile column.
