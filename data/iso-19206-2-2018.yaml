    This document specifies performance requirements for surrogate targets used to assess the system detection and activation performance of active safety systems.
    This document specifies the properties of pedestrian targets that represent an adult or a child in terms of size, shape, reflection properties, etc. for testing purposes. The document addresses the detection requirements for a pedestrian target in terms of sensing technologies commonly in use at the time of publication of this document, and where possible, anticipated future sensing technologies. It also addresses methodologies to verify the target response properties to these sensors, as well as some performance requirements for the target carrier.
    This document does not address the test procedures in terms of speeds, positions, or timing of events. Performance criteria for the active safety system being evaluated are also not addressed.
    A related test procedure using pedestrian targets according to this document can be found in ISO 19237.
