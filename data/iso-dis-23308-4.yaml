    This document specifies the method of fuel consumption measurement for rough terrain- truck variable-reach trucks as defined in ISO 5053-1, herein after referred to as trucks. It does not apply to slewing trucks having a movement of more than 5° either side of the longitudinal axis.
    This part is intended to be used in conjunction with ISO 23308-1. Where the requirements of this part differ from that in part 1, requirements in this part 4 will take precedence.
