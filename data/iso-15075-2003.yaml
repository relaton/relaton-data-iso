  content: "ISO 15075:2003 specifies message content and format utilized by in-vehicle
    navigation systems. Its emphasis is on messages that are required to generate
    or enhance routing instructions. There is a particular focus on messages that
    would not necessarily be included in a more general traffic management message
    list. \nAlthough ISO 15075:2003 emphasizes requirements for Locally Determined
    Route Guidance (LDRG) systems that utilize on-vehicle map databases, it also includes
    messages that would be utilized primarily by Centrally Determined Route Guidance
    (CDRG) systems and certain value-added messages."
