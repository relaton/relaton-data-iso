    This document provides general considerations to support the design guidance to geotechnical and civil engineers involved in the design of structures in which a geotextile is used to fulfil the function of separation of soils and below ground structures in contact with natural soils and fills.
    These considerations are always based on installed soils, the installation process and on the strength and/or deformation behaviour of geosynthetics.
