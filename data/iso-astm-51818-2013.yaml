  content: "ISO/ASTM 51818:2013 covers dosimetric procedures to be followed in installation
    qualification, operational qualification and performance qualification (IQ, OQ,
    PQ), and routine processing at electron beam facilities to ensure that the product
    has been treated with an acceptable range of absorbed doses. Other procedures
    related to IQ, OQ, PQ, and routine product processing that may influence absorbed
    dose in the product are also discussed.\nThe electron beam energy range covered
    in ISO/ASTM 51818:2013 is between 80 and 300 keV, generally referred to as low
    energy. Dosimetry is only one component of a total quality assurance program for
    an irradiation facility. Other measures may be required for specific applications
    such as medical device sterilization and food preservation. \nISO/ASTM 51818:2013
    is one of a set of standards that provides recommendations for properly implementing
    and utilizing dosimetry in radiation processing. It is intended to be read in
    conjunction with ASTM E2232."
