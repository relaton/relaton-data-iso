    ISO/IEC 20648:2016 details the requirements for use of the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol in conjunction with data storage technologies. The requirements set out in this specification are intended to facilitate secure interoperability of storage clients and servers as well as non-storage technologies that may have similar interoperability needs.
    ISO/IEC 20648:2016 is relevant to anyone involved in owning, operating or using data storage devices. This includes senior managers, acquirers of storage product and service, and other non-technical managers or users, in addition to managers and administrators who have specific responsibilities for information security and/or storage security, storage operation, or who are responsible for an organization's overall security program and security policy development. It is also relevant to anyone involved in the planning, design and implementation of the architectural aspects of storage security.
