abstract:
- content: This part of ISO 6305 specifies the quality requirements of the product
    and the conditions of acceptance testing for sleepers. When the products are to
    be manufactured from flat plates, an alternative but equivalent specification
    may be agreed between the purchaser and the manufacturer. Annex A includes the
    checking of dimensions and tolerances, annex B shows a check gauge for inclination
    of the rail seats, and annexes C and D contain progressive sampling plans.
