abstract:
- content: |-
    ISO/IEC 629431-18-1:2011(E) describes an architecture that provides the infrastructure that allows generic UPnP devices, services and control points deployed in remote physical devices to interact with the corresponding UPnP devices, services and control points physically attached to the home network. The mechanisms defined in this architecture will allow to extend the home network so that it will logically include the remote devices so that all devices will be able to communicate among themselves using the UPnP Forum defined mechanisms, e.g. UDA. The desired behaviour of the interactions between the remote device and home devices is envisioned to be similar with the one expected as if all devices are located in the
    same local area network.
