    This document provides guidance for product and service acquirers, as well as suppliers of hardware, software and services, regarding:
    a)    gaining visibility into and managing the information security risks caused by physically dispersed and multi-layered hardware, software, and services supply chains;
    b)    responding to risks stemming from this physically dispersed and multi-layered hardware, software, and services supply chain that can have an information security impact on the organizations using these products and services;
    c)    integrating information security processes and practices into the system and software life cycle processes, as described in ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 and ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207, while supporting information security controls, as described in ISO/IEC 27002.
    This document does not include business continuity management/resiliency issues involved with the hardware, software, and services supply chain. ISO/IEC 27031 addresses information and communication technology readiness for business continuity.
