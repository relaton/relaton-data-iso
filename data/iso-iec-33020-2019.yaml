abstract:
- content: |-
    This document defines a process measurement framework that supports the assessment of process capability, in accordance with the requirements of ISO/IEC 33003. The process measurement framework provides a schema that can be used to construct a process assessment model conformant with ISO/IEC 33004 which can be used in the performance of assessment of process capability according to the requirements of ISO/IEC 33002. In the context of this document and related standards, process capability is a process quality characteristic related to the ability of a process to consistently meet current or projected business goals.
    The process measurement framework defined in this document forms a structure which
    a)   facilitates self-assessment,
    b)   provides a basis for use in process improvement and process quality determination,
    c)   is applicable across all application domains and sizes of organization,
    d)   produces a set of process (capability) attribute ratings (process profile), and
    e)   derives a process capability level.
    This document also includes as informative annexes a set of assessment indicators of process capability that can be used in the construction of a process assessment model using this process measurement framework, and guidance on the meaning of the process capability levels and the achievement of the process attributes.
