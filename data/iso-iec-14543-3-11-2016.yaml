  content: ISO/IEC 14543-3-11:2016(E) specifies an OSI Layers 1 to 3 Frequency Modulated
    Wireless Protocol for low-power devices such as energy harvested devices in a
    home environment. The protocol is specifically designed to keep the energy consumption
    of such sensors and switches extremely low.
