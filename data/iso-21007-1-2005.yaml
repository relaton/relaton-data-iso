  content: "ISO 21007-1:2005 establishes a common framework for data structure for
    unambiguous identification of single or manifolded gas cylinders and for other
    common data elements in this sector. It also serves as a terminology document
    in the area of radio frequency identification (RFID) technology.\nThe scheme and
    reference model architecture proposed is designed to be an enabling structure
    to allow some harmonization between different commercial systems and not prescriptive
    in determining any one system. It is not frequency or air interface protocol specific,
    provides maximum interoperability, has a high population capability and provides
    the possibility of upwards migration to more capable systems.\nISO 21007-1:2005
    provides a reference structure within which the key core elements of the data
    structure form an unambiguous identification that may be used to identify the
    message as a message from a gas cylinder within an electronic data interchange
    (EDI) environment and provides an application reference identifying that different
    data structure is contained in the message. A wide variety of such systems can
    be supported within the structure determined in ISO 21007-1:2005 such as identification
    of specialty gases and different gas applications. Each such system may range
    from individual simple identification to identification of such factors as content,
    fill date, history of use, etc.\nISO 21007-1:2005 does not include the air interface
    or any aspect of the equipment, solely the data element structure. Subsequent
    parts of ISO 21007 will define the data structures for gas cylinders and for specific
    sectors of application.\nThe numbering scheme views the Identification (ID) as
    a data element, and the common basic data structure is defined as a data identifier
    code. The adoption of the Abstract Syntax Notification (ASN.1) structure in a
    form to meet the requirements of ISO 21007-1:2005 and subsequent subordinate parts
    of ISO 21007 enables the ISO 21007 series of standards to meet its objectives
    of \n- being adaptable and expandable,\n- providing a migration path to enhancement
    and future developments,\n- avoiding carrying unnecessary information for irrelevant
    applications in any data construct,\n- using existing standard codings wherever
    possible, and \n- carrying a minimum of overhead in storage and transmission."
