    This document describes three methods for the exposure of plastics in a marine environment. Method A covers exposures where specimens float on the surface, method B covers exposures where specimens are partially immersed method C covers exposures where specimens are completely immersed. Although intended for marine (salt water) exposure, the methodology can be used with outdoor brackish water and fresh-water exposures as well. Direct weathering of plastics on land is described in ISO 877-1, ISO 877-2 and ISO 877-3.
    Method A is particularly applicable to enhanced-degradability plastics where the environmental degradation under marine floating exposure is expected to be accelerated relative to that of regular plastic materials.
    This document specifies the general requirements for the apparatus, and procedures for using the test methods described.
    It lists properties that can be used to evaluate changes in plastics subjected to marine exposure. More specific information about methods for determining the changes in properties of plastics on exposure and reporting these results is given in ISO 4582.
