    ISO 18263-1:2015 establishes a system which can be used as the basis for specifications for mixtures of polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene (PE) recyclate.
    It covers mixtures of polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene (PE) recyclate derived from PP and PE used for flexible and rigid consumer packaging for moulding and extrusion. Recyclate from packaging used for the transport, handling, or storage of hazardous goods shall not be used.
    It does not apply to mixtures of recyclates and virgin resin.
    It does not apply to the mixtures containing special type of PE or PP, for example, PE-UHMW, TPO, etc.
    The types of mixtures of PP and PE recyclate are differentiated from each other by a classification system based on appropriate levels of the designatory properties.
    a)    Composition
    b)    Melt mass-flow rate
    c)    Density
    d)    Colour
    It is not intended to imply that materials having the same designation give necessarily the same performance. ISO 18263-1:2015 does not provide engineering data, performance data, or data on processing conditions which may be required to specify a material for a particular application and/or method of processing. If additional properties are required, they shall be determined in accordance with the test methods specified in ISO 18263-2, if applicable.
