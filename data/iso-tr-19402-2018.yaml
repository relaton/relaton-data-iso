    This document summarises the common methods for evaluating the adhesive strength of coatings on a substrate, which can be another coating beneath or the substrate itself. The test methods and evaluation methods are described in Clauses 4, 5, and 6. In the case of standardized test methods the respective standard is referenced in regard to procedure and evaluation. Annex A compares the methods in the synoptic Tables A.1, A.2, and A.3.
    Often the adhesive strength cannot be sufficiently evaluated by means of a single method.
    The purely physical methods for measuring the adhesive strength are such in which mechanical quantities (e.g. force or torsion moment) are measured directly.
    All other methods are based on the evaluation of behaviour under mechanic stress according to practical conditions. For these methods the viscoelastic properties have a wide influence on the evaluation of the adhesive strength, so that it can only be tested comparatively within one method.
    Each method has its specific application. An unsuitable method can lead to false information. All of the test methods for the evaluation of the adhesive strength require a certain routine of the test person, especially in regard to identifying the separation line. For most of the test methods the test results, among other things, depend on the film thickness of the coating to be tested. In addition, for several methods differences between tests on a test sheet and in practice can occur, due to different roughness of the substrate.
    Effects of delamination caused by weathering or corrosion influences are not subject of this document.
    In case cohesion failures predominantly occur during an adhesive strength test, this is no measure for the adhesive strength. However, information can be given on the protective effect of the coating against corrosion.
