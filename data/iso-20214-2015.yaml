    ISO 20214:2015 is intended as a high-level systems engineering reference to enable engineers to better understand the layered security concepts required to secure a space system. As such, this document is a Security Architecture for Space Data Systems (SASDS).
    This architecture uses the views described in the Reference Architecture for Space Data Systems (reference [B1]) developed by the CCSDS Architecture Working Group.
    The SASDS will be used:
    ?         to establish an overall CCSDS conceptual framework for the incorporation of security into the data systems of space missions;
    ?         to define common language and representation so that risks, requirements, and solutions in the area of security within space data systems can be readily communicated;
    ?         to provide a source of information for the security architects on a space mission to use to develop the system security design;
    ?         to facilitate development of standards in a consistent way so that any standard can be used with other appropriate standards in a system.
