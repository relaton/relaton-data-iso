- content: |-
    ISO 16488:2015 presents a general method to be followed for the systematic analysis, design, and evaluation of net cage marine finfish farms. One common style of a net cage finfish farm is shown in Figure 1. A mooring system holds together a series of net cages which contain finfish. Water from the outside environment freely passes through the nets, providing the necessary environment for farming finfish. The methodology presented in this International Standard allows for determination of the adequacy of a given finfish farm's floating structure, nets, and mooring equipment for a given environment. The standard addresses specification of a design basis through evaluation of environmental conditions and acceptable risk, and specifies acceptable techniques for the design and analysis of finfish farms. This International Standard also provides guidelines for development of a handbook which documents procedures for correct maintenance and operation of the finfish farm.
    The application of the standard is intended to reduce the risk of escape from marine finfish farms. This International Standard is designed to be used by the operator of a net cage marine finfish farm. It is intended that through application of this International Standard that increased human safety and system integrity levels can be achieved.
