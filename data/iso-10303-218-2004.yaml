abstract:
- content: "ISO 10303-218:2004 specifies the use of the integrated resources necessary
    for the scope and information requirements for the exchange of product definition
    data and its configuration and approval status information for ship structural
    systems. Configuration in this context pertains to data specific to revision tracking
    and change history of selected ship structural entities within the product model.\nApproval
    pertains to the company internal approval and the classification society approval.
    ISO 10303-218:2004 supports the shipbuilding activities and applications associated
    with the design phase and the manufacturing phase.\nNOTE 1 The application activity
    model in Annex F provides a graphical representation of the processes and information
    flows that are the basis for the definition of the scope of ISO 10303-218:2004.\nNOTE
    2 The detailed technical discussion in Annex L provides details that define the
    basis for the definition of the scope of ISO 10303-218:2004 and details that define
    the basis of harmonization with other parts of ISO 10303 for product exchange
    of data for ships.\nThe following are within the scope of ISO 10303-218:2004:\n-
    product definition data pertaining to the ship structure which includes hull structure,
    superstructure and all other internal structures of commercial and naval ships;\n-
    product definition data pertaining to the ship structure;\n- product definition
    data pertaining to the pre-design phase of the ship structure;\n- product definition
    data pertaining to the main design phase of the ship structure;\n- product definition
    data pertaining to the manufacturing phase of the ship structure;\n- product definition
    data pertaining to the product structuring of ships, including the structuring
    by system and by assemblies within the ship;\n- product definition data identifying
    the ship general characteristics which are relevant to the design of the ship
    structure.\nNOTE The general characteristics include ship main dimensions, designations
    and principle characteristics, as well as the rules, regulations and standards
    applicable to the ship. They also include lightships weight distribution and free-board
    characteristics for the purpose of design and design approvals.\n- product definition
    data pertaining to the ship global coordinate system, local coordinate systems
    and spacing grids, which are used for defining the geometry of the ship structure;\n-
    product definition data pertaining to the geometrical representation of the ship
    structure parts and assemblies;\n- product definition data pertaining to the hull
    plating and the stiffener profiles, and the definition of structural features,
    which comprise the ship structure parts and assemblies, including functional descriptions.\nEXAMPLE
    Edge, corner and interior cut-outs are examples of structural features\n- product
    definition data pertaining to the design of the welded connections and joints
    of ship structure parts and assemblies, including edge preparations and weld type
    and size;\n- product definition data pertaining to the specification of transverse
    cross-sections through the ship structure for the purpose of approval of strength;\n-
    product definition data pertaining to ship design loads, including shear forces
    and bending moments acting on the ship structure, for the purpose of determining
    the longitudinal strength of the ship;\n- product definition data pertaining to
    the weights and centres of gravity of the ship structure parts and assemblies;\n-
    product definition data pertaining to the materials of ship structure, required
    to manufacture the ship or a part of it;\n- product definition data pertaining
    to the configuration management of the ship structure, including approval, versioning
    and change administration;\n- product definition data pertaining to external references,
    technical documentation and other supporting concepts which are necessary and
    pertinent to the design and manufacture of the ship structure parts and assemblies.
    \nThe following are outside the scope of ISO 10303-218:2004:\n- product definition
    data pertaining to the ship structure at the operation and de-commissioning phases
    of the ship life cycle;\n- business data for the management of a ship development
    project, such as budgets, schedules and resource requirements;\n- product definition
    data pertaining to the direct calculation of ship structure in the design stage;\n-
    product definition data pertaining to the coating of structural parts as well
    as the production tolerances;\n- product definition data pertaining to the ship
    subdivision;\n- product definition data pertaining to the ship distribution systems;\nEXAMPLE
    The electrical, piping and HVAC systems\n- product definition data pertaining
    to the ship machinery and propulsion systems;\n- product definition data pertaining
    to the ship outfit and furnishing;\nEXAMPLE Ladders, some foundations, pre-assembled
    hull outfit items, doors, and the like.\n- product definition data pertaining
    to ship hull structure parts which are manufactured by forging or casting.\nEXAMPLE
    Stern frames, rudder horns and propeller shaft brackets."
