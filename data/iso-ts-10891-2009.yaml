    ISO/TS 10891:2009 establishes:
    It is intended to be applicable to freight containers as defined in ISO 668 as well as to other containers not defined in ISO 668 and container ancillary equipment such as road and terminal chassis, generator sets and power packs .
    The use of container tags and the equipping of containers for automatic identification are optional. The purpose of ISO/TS 10891:2009 is to optimise the efficiency of equipment control systems and to assist in container security initiatives and programs, including the optional usage of electronic seals in accordance with ISO 18185, and any subsequent International Standard. For this reason, any container tag system used for identifying containers shall be non-proprietary and conform to and be compatible with ISO/TS 10891:2009.
