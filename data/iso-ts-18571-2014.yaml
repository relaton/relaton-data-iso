abstract:
- content: ISO/TS 18571:2014 provides validation metrics and rating procedures to
    be used to calculate the level of correlation between two non-ambiguous signals
    obtained from a physical test and a computational model, and is aimed at vehicle
    safety applications. The objective comparison of time-history signals of model
    and test is validated against various loading cases under different types of physical
    loads such as forces, moments, and accelerations. However, other applications
    might be possible too, but are not within the scope of ISO/TS 18571:2014.
