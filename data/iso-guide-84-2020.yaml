abstract:
- content: |-
    This document provides guidance to standards developers on how to take account of climate change in the planning, drafting, revision and updating of ISO standards and other deliverables.
    It outlines a framework and general principles that standards developers can use to develop their own approach to addressing climate change on a subject-specific basis.
    It aims to enable standards developers to include adaptation to climate change (ACC) and climate change mitigation (CCM) considerations in their standardization work. Considerations related to ACC are intended to contribute to increasing preparedness and disaster reduction as well as impacting the resilience of organizations and their technologies, activities or products (TAPs). Considerations related to CCM consist primarily of approaches that seek to avoid, reduce or limit the release of GHG emissions and/or increase GHG removals.
