    This document specifies methods of assessing the resistance of printed materials to liquid and solid agents, solvents, varnishes and acids.
    It applies to printing on all substrates by any of the traditional printing process (offset, screen, gravure, flexo) as well as the newer digital processes (inkjet, electrophotography).
    Aspects of food safety and consumer protection for food contact materials are not covered.
