abstract:
- content: "This document describes guidelines for developing education and training
    systems using VR/AR/MR technology.  It defines VR/AR/MR based information modelling
    that can be used for education and training systems. It provides procedures and
    methods to be used when developing 3D VR/AR/MR based education and training systems
    using ISO/IEC JTC 1 standards. It also provides a systematic approach to developing
    VR/AR/MR based applications for systems integration areas.\n\nThis work will:\n•\tdefine
    concepts of VR/AR/MR based education and training. \n•\tdefine an information
    modelling architecture for VR/AR/MR based education and training systems.\n•\tspecify
    standards based functional components for VR/AR/MR based education and training
    systems. \n•\tspecify framework components for implementing VR/AR/MR based education
    and training systems. \n•\tinclude use cases for VR/AR/MR based education and
    training systems based on the information modelling architecture.\nDevice hardware
    technology for VR/AR/MR based education and training systems is excluded from
    this draft."
