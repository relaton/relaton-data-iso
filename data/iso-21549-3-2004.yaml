    ISO 21549-3:2004 describes and defines the limited clinical data objects used in or referenced by patient-held health data cards using UML, plain text and abstract syntax notation (ASN.1).
    It is applicable to situations in which such data are recorded on or transported by patient healthcards whose physical dimensions are compliant with those of ID-1 cards as defined by ISO/IEC 7810.
    It specifies the basic structure of the data contained within the data object limited clinical data, but does not specify or mandate particular data-sets for storage on devices. In particular, the data contained within the data objects in limited clinical data are intended to aid the delivery of emergency care, but are by themselves neither intended, nor suitable, for the provision of all the information required.
