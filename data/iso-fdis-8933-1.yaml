  content: "This standard describes generic measuring and calculation methods to evaluate
    the energy efficiency of individual maritime components.\nA maritime component
    is defined as having a single function.\nMaritime components are grouped according
    to their functionality to compare the energy efficiency of components which can
    solve the same task onboard a vessel. \n\nThe standard is limited to components
    for which a “unit output” can be clearly defined and which require energy to function.
    \n\nThe standard only covers energy consuming components.\n\nThis standard deals
    with five types of components:\na.    Pressure components \nb.    Flow components\nc.
    \   Lighting\nd.    Heating/Cooling components\ne.    Mechanical components\n\nThe
    energy efficiency is evaluated using a specified set of global ambient conditions.
    The energy efficiency is also evaluated using ambient conditions for operation
    in arctic, tempered or tropical regions."
