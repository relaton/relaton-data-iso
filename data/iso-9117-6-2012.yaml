    ISO 9117-6:2012 specifies a method for assessing, by means of a simple empirical test, the resistance of a coat of paint, varnish or related product to imprinting by a nylon gauze under a specified force applied for a specified time.
    The method may be carried out
    - either as a "pass/fail" test by determining whether the print-free state has been reached after a specified period of drying or, in the case of stoving coatings, after stoving and ageing under specified conditions,
    - or by repeating the print-free test at suitable intervals until the print-free time is obtained.
