    ISO 13399-80:2014 specifies the basic principles for the creation and exchange of simplified 3D models of cutting items, tool items, and adaptive items, using related properties and domains of values. Simplified 3D models contain the following: naming and defining of the basic design features of cutting items, tool items, and adaptive items, with an association to the used properties; naming and defining of the internal structure of the 3D model that represents the features and the properties of cutting items, tool items, and adaptive items; naming and defining of those elements and features that are not defined in ISO/TS 13399‑50, but are necessary to design 3D models.
    The following are outside the scope of ISO 13399-80:2014: applications where these standard data may be stored or referenced; creation and exchange of simplified 3D models for cutting tools; creation and exchange of simplified 3D models for tool items; creation and exchange of simplified 3D models for adaptive items; creation and exchange of simplified 3D models for assembly items and auxiliary items.
