abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: ISO/IEC 24792:2010 specifies a Multicast Session Management Protocol (MSMP),
    which is an application-layer control protocol for managing quality of service
    for group communication. The MSMP is designed to provide IP multicast-based multimedia
    applications with QoS management required for group multicasting such as QoS monitoring
    and reporting. The MSMP will operate over the conventional transport protocols
    and/or Enhanced Communications Transport Protocol (ECTP), and can be used as a
    control protocol together with the Group Management Protocol (GMP). Generally
    it is assumed that there is one MSMP server, one session creating client (or Session
    Creator), and one or more session participating clients (or Session Participants).
    MSMP consists of QoS management (QM) functions. QM can have five operations, e.g.
    QoS Report request and response, QoS Setting request and response, QoS Updating
    request and response, QoS Value request and response, and QoS Termination request
    and response. Detailed QoS setting mechanisms can be adopted if necessary.
