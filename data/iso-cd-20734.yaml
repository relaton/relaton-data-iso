  content: This document explores and references the different daylight metrics used
    globally that could have been specifically designed to address different situations
    (e.g. climates, seasonal specific sunlight availability, cultural values, and
    seasonal weather patterns). This document also provides quality views criteria
    for all regularly occupied areas within a building. Finally, the design process
    is outlined which lists necessary actions during design, construction, commissioning,
    post commissioning, post occupancy evaluations, and continual improvement.
