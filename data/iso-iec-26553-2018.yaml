    This document, within the context of tools and methods of detailed design and implementation for software and system product lines:
    —          provides the terms and definitions specific to realization for software and systems product lines;
    —          defines processes performed during product line realization (those processes are described in terms of purpose, inputs, tasks and outcomes);
    —          defines method capabilities to support the defined tasks of each process; and
    —          defines tool capabilities to automate/semi-automate tasks or defined method capabilities.
    This document concerns processes and capabilities of realization tools and methods for a family of products, not for a single system.
