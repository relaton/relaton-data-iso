  content: Applies to extenal and internal elements in ordinary buildings and houses,
    but do not apply to doors and doorsets in rooms with special atmospheres (such
    as doors to freezing rooms,etc.). The effect of humidity and/or temperature on
    the material as well as insufficient hygrothermal stability with respect to air
    penetration, sound insulation and operating force are measured and the change
    in the shape and dimensions determined. Four climate categories are specified.
