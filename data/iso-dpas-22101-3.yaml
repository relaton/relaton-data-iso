abstract:
- content: "This document specifies the fittings made from short glass fibre reinforced
    polyethylene (PE-sGF) manufactured by spiral cross winding method used below ground
    for the conveyance of fluids for industrial and agricultural use shown below:\n¾     
    chemical plant;\n¾      industrial sewerage engineering;\n¾      power engineering
    (cooling and general-purpose water supply);\n¾      agricultural production plants;\n¾     
    water treatment;\n¾      small hydraulic power plant (general-purpose water supply).\nThis
    document also specifies the test parameters for the test methods referred to in
    this International Standard.\nIn conjunction with the other parts of ISO PAS 22101-1,
    ISO PAS 22101-2 and ISO/DPAS 22101-5, this document applies to PE-sGF fittings,
    to joints with components of PE-sGF or other materials, intended to be used under
    the  following conditions:\na)     A maximum allowable operating pressure (PFA)
    up to and including 25 bar;\nb)     An operating temperature of 20 ℃ as the reference
    temperature.\nNOTE  1   For other operating temperatures, guidance is given in
    ISO PAS 22101-1: Annex A.\nThis document covers a range of maximum allowable operating
    pressures and givens requirements concerning colours and additives.\nNOTE 2  
    It is the responsibility of the purchaser or specifier to make the appropriate
    selections from these aspects, taking into account their particular requirements
    and any relevant national guidance or regulations and installation practices or
    codes.\nThis document is applicable to fittings of the following types: \n- electrofusion
    socket fittings\n- loose backing flanges and flange adapters \n- fabricated fittings
    (see Annex A)"
