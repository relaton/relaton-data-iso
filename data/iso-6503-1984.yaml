  content: The method is principle to coating materials having lead contents in the
    range of about 0,01 % (m/m) to 2 % (m/m), may also be applicable to products with
    a total lead content of more than 2 % (m/m) when the requirements of precision
    does not exceed the specified values. two methods are given. The principle of
    the dry ashing method consists in evaporation of a test portion to dryness and
    ashing at 475 C and extraction of any lead in the residue with hydrochloric acid;
    that of the wet oxidation method consists in wet oxidation of a test portion with
    a mixture of sulfuric acid and hydrogen peroxide or with sulfuric acid and nitric
    acid and extraction of any lead in the residue with EDTA and ammonia solution.
