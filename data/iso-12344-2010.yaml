    ISO 12344:2010 specifies the equipment and procedures for determining the bending behaviour of full-size products (Method A) and test specimens (Method B) under the action of three-point loading. It is applicable to thermal insulating products for building applications.
    The test is designed to determine the bending strength of products and their deflection at a given load.
    The method can be used to determine the resistance of the product to bending stresses during transport and application.
