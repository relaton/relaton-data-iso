abstract:
- content: ISO 22472:2006 provides guidance for the planning, installation and operational
    testing of voyage data recorder (VDR) and simplified voyage data recorder (S-VDR)
    installations according to the electric/electronic and acoustic specifications
    of IMO A.861 (20), IMO MSC.163 (78) and IEC 61996 (including IEC 61996-2, Simplified
    voyage data recorder). These standards mainly deal with interfaces between VDR/S-VDR
    and external sensors, which is the main subject for technical agreements between
    user, shipyard, VDR/S-VDR supplier and/or sensor manufacturers when installations
    are planned. In addition, matters of performance test and playback are also described.
    Furthermore, details for checking of items related to the interfaces and the installation
    are introduced. ISO 22472:2006 is not intended for the standardization of performance
    factors and functional requirements related to VDR and/or S-VDR.
