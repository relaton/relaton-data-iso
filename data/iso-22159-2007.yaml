  content: "ISO 22159:2007 specifies requirements, test methods, marking and information
    to be supplied by the manufacturer for descending devices. It also specifies some
    basic requirements for the descent lines to be used with the descending devices.
    \nISO 22159:2007 is applicable to automatic and manually operated descending devices
    intended for use in the workplace in access, egress, work positioning and rescue
    systems. Various types and classes of descending devices are defined according
    to function and performance. These descending devices can be used in situations
    other than the workplace if adequate training and/or supervision are provided.
    \nISO 22159:2007 is not intended to apply to descending devices used in leisure
    activities such as recreational climbing and caving, although its requirements
    can be useful in specifying such equipment."
