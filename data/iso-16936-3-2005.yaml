  content: 'ISO 16936-3:2005 sets forth a physical test method for security glazing
    designed to resist actions of manual attack by delaying access of objects and/or
    persons to a protected space for a short period of time. Its application is limited
    to the evaluation and the classification of the resistance of forced entry security
    glazing against the following threats: blunt tool impacts; sharp tool impacts;
    thermal stress; chemical stress (optional). It is not applicable to the use of
    power (motor- or engine-driven) tools or devices, explosives, military ordinance
    and tools, and processes or devices requiring more than two persons to transport
    and operate.'
