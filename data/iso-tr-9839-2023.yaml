    This document is intended to be applied to the usage of predictive maintenance methods for the detection of degrading faults in safety related E/E hardware elements. It applies to hardware elements developed for compliance with the ISO 26262[1] series in which degrading faults are shown to be relevant due to, for instance, the technology used.
    Specific technical implementations of predictive maintenance solutions are not in scope of this document.
