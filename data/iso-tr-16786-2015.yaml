    ISO/TR 16786:2015 provides guidelines for disclosing simulation conditions and results when evaluating the performance of signal control methods, focusing on algorithm that establishes signal timings based on traffic conditions. The following are the main aims of the evaluation of signal control systems:
    a)    to evaluate the quality of the algorithm in various traffic conditions;
    b)    to evaluate the validity of the algorithm for specific applications (types of intersection);
    c)    to establish a fair comparison of the algorithm versus other existing algorithms or other types of control systems;
    d)    to evaluate the results of the implementation of a signal control system objectively.
    When claiming and/or comparing the performance of signal control systems from simulation results, it is necessary to clarify simulation conditions and results so that third parties can objectively judge its fairness and reasonability.
    ISO/TR 16786:2 describes minimum necessary items of conditions that shall be disclosed to ensure fair evaluation and does not describe maximum possible items.
