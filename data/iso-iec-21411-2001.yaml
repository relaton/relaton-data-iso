    This International Standard specifies signalling interworking between "QSIG" and "H.323" in support of call diversion
    supplementary services within a Corporate telecommunication Network (CN).
    "QSIG" is a signalling protocol that operates at the Q reference point between Private Integrated Services eXchanges (PINX)
    within a Private Integrated Services Network (PISN). The Q reference point is defined in ISO/IEC 11579-1. A PISN provides
    circuit-switched basic services and supplementary services to its users. QSIG is specified in other Standards, in particular
    ISO/IEC 11572 (call control in support of basic services), ISO/IEC 11582 (generic functional protocol for the support of
    supplementary services) and a number of standards specifying individual supplementary services. ISO/IEC 13873 specifies the
    QSIG protocol in support of call diversion services.
    "H.323" is a set of signalling protocols for the support of voice or multimedia communication within a packet network, in
    particular a packet network that uses the Internet Protocol (IP) as its network layer protocol (IP network). H.323 signalling
    protocols operate between endpoints in an IP network, either indirectly via one or more gatekeepers, or directly. An endpoint
    can be a terminal or a gateway to another network. H.323 is an "umbrella" recommendation referring to various ITU-T
    recommendations, in particular Recommendations H.225.0 and H.245 (basic communication capabilities) and
    Recommendation H.450.1 (generic functional protocol for the support of supplementary services). Recommendation H.450.3
    specifies the H.323 protocol in support of call diversion services.
    NOTE - H.450.3 applies only to the 1998 version of H.323 (also known as H.323 version 2) and to later versions.
    In both ISO/IEC 13873 (QSIG) and ITU-Recommendation H.450.3 (H.323), the call diversion supplementary services are Call
    Forwarding Unconditional (SS-CFU), Call Forwarding Busy (SS-CFB), Call Forwarding No Reply (SS-CFNR) and Call
    Deflection (SS-CD). These supplementary services apply during call establishment and provide diversion of an incoming call to
    another destination.
    Interworking between QSIG and H.323 permits a call originating at a user of a PISN to terminate at a user of an IP network, or
    a call originating at a user of an IP network to terminate at a user of a PISN. This International Standard provides the following
    additional capabilities:
    _ a call originating from a PISN and destined for a user of an H.323 network to be diverted by the H.323 network to an
    alternative destination;
    _ a call originating from an H.323 network and destined for a user of a PISN to be diverted by the PISN to an alternative
    destination;
    _ a call destined for a user of a PISN to be diverted to an alternative destination where that alternative destination is in an
    H.323 network;
    _ a call destined for a user of an H.323 network to be diverted to an alternative destination where that alternative destination
    is in a PISN.
    This International Standard is applicable to any interworking unit that can act as a gateway between a PISN employing QSIG
    and an IP network employing H.323.
