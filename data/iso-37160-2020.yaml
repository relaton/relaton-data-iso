  content: "This document specifies methods for measuring the quality of thermal power
    infrastructure (QTPI) during the operational phase and requirements for operations
    and management activities. \nIt is intended for use by electric power providers,
    including public utilities and independent power producers (hereinafter collectively
    referred to as power plant operators), as well as relevant stakeholders that intend
    to maintain and improve QTPI.\nNOTE    The selection and importance of evaluation
    indicators resulting from the implementation of this document can vary depending
    on the characteristics of the power plant operator."
