  content: "ISO/IEC 23004-7:2008 specifies the interfaces of the support application
    programming interface (API) and the realization technology used for Integrity
    Management in MPEG Multimedia Middleware (M3W). Integrity Management is an optional
    framework for M3W Platforms. The goal is to have controlled upgrading and extension.
    Basically this means reducing the chance of breaking the system during an upgrade/extension
    and giving the ability to restore a consistent configuration when things have
    gone wrong. \nISO/IEC 23004-7:2008 specifies entities and interfaces for the following.
    \n- Monitoring: This is basically extraction of the model that describes the software
    and hardware configuration of the terminal (self model). \n- Diagnosis: Based
    on the self model framework, this will need to determine whether there is a fault
    in the configuration. \n- Repair: The faults that have been identified during
    diagnosis will need to be removed when this is possible using the facilities for
    upgrading and extension offered by M3W. "
