    ISO 18566-4:2017 specifies the control of ceiling mounted radiant heating and cooling panels. The requirements in this document are applicable only to the components of the heating/cooling systems and the elements which are part of the heating/cooling panels and which are installed to provide heating and/or cooling.
    ISO 18566-4:2017 is applicable to water-based ceiling mounted radiant heating and cooling panels in residential, commercial and industrial buildings. The methods apply to systems mounted under the ceiling with or without open air gaps between the panels and the ceiling.
