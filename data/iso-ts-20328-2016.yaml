    ISO/TS 20328:2016 specifies the measurements and specifications of the dimensions of a lenticular lens sheet. It describes measurement methods and specifies the nominal sizes and target dimensions with tolerance. It also describes methods to test the stability of dimensions of the lenticular lens sheet.
    ISO/TS 20328:2016 is applicable to lenticular lens sheets used in lenticular prints, including those that give an image the illusion of depth or make images appear to change/move as the image is viewed from different angles. Both impact and non-impact printing can be used to generate the images. Examples of the former are off-set, gravure and flexography, while the examples of the latter are silver halide, inkjet, dye diffusion thermal transfer and electrophotography.
