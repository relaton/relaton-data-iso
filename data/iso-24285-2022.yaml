    This document specifies the requirements and test methods for factory-made cellular glass products, which are used for thermal insulation of building equipment and industrial installations, with an operating temperature range of approximately −265 °C to +430 °C. The products are manufactured in the form of slabs, faced or unfaced boards, pipe sections, segments and prefabricated ware.
    This document describes product characteristics and test methods, designation code, marking and labelling.
    This document does not apply to:
    —    products with a declared thermal conductivity greater than 0,065 W/(m·K) at 10 °C;
    —    products for the insulation of the building structure.
    This document does not specify the required level of a given property to be achieved by a product to demonstrate fitness for purpose in a particular application. Specific requirements agreed between the purchaser and the supplier (e.g. type, dimensions and forms, regulatory compliance and inspection requirements or certification requirements), are outside the scope of this document.
