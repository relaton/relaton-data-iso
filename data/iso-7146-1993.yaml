abstract:
- content: Defines, describes and classifies the characteristics and causes of damage
    and changes in appearance occurring in service in hydrodynamically lubricated
    plain bearings and journals. Consideration is restricted to characteristic forms
    of change and damage which have a well-defined appearance and which can be attributed
    to particular causes with a high degree of certainty. The features peculiar to
    the change and damage are described, the various forms are illustrated with photographs
    and diagrams, and the most frequent causes are given.
