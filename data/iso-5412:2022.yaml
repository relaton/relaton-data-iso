    This document specifies the requirements, test methods, test regulations, packaging, transportation and storage of industrial compostable plastic shopping bags.
    This document is applicable to plastic shopping bags made from industrial compostable plastic resin as the main raw material, processed by heat sealing or bonding, etc.
    This document does not apply to industrial compostable plastic bags such as industrial compostable roll bags (also known as tear bags or point break bags made from above materials) and other bags that are only used in packaging and are not used for carrying shopping.
    This document enables to characterise the compostable plastic bags following two testing approaches that bring to the definition of two classes (class I and class II).
    NOTE      In some regions, industrial composting is referred to as professional composting.
