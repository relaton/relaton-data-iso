abstract:
- content: "This document specifies methods to evaluate the performance of a specific
    class of analytical instruments, known as compliance monitoring devices (CMDs).
    These instruments are designed and intended to examine ballast water to determine
    whether a sample meets or exceeds limits for the concentration of living or viable
    organisms. These limits include those specified by the International Maritime
    Organization (IMO) Regulation D-2 in the International Convention for the Control
    and Management of Ships' Ballast Water and Sediments[4] or other discharge standards
    (DS) adopted by national or regional authorities. \nThe test methods measure the
    agreement between the CMD and a reference method to calculate trueness and precision.
    Both trueness and precision consider only simple, categorical outcomes (e.g. “meets”
    or “exceeds” the DS). The performance metric reliability is quantified by the
    frequency of instances when the CMD is not available or is not operating as expected.\nThe
    set of tests and trials is based upon the CMD manufacturer claims, such as the
    DS group(s) targeted by the CMD, and known limitations, including those based
    upon the salinity of the sample water.\nNOTE       Additional tests and trials,
    if required by the end-user, can follow this general test method. Guidance on
    determining experimental power is found in 7.5. This document provides guidance
    for customizing the tests to evaluate the claims of the manufacturer or to address
    optional factors of interest to the end-users.\nThis document does not set or
    recommend success criteria of any performance metric, as these are appropriately
    defined by the end-users."
