    ISO 13125:2013 specifies a test method covering the determination of the antifungal activity of materials that contain a photocatalyst or have photocatalytic films on their surface, by counting the number of pre-incubated fungal spores that survive exposure to ultraviolet (UV-A) light.
    ISO 13125:2013 provides for the assessment of different kinds on materials used in various applications, such as construction materials in flat coating, sheet, board or plate form, etc. Powder, granular, fibrous or porous photocatalytic materials are not included.
    Values expressed in ISO 13125:2013 are in accordance with the International System of Units (SI).
