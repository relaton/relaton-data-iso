    This document specifies strength requirements and test methods for wheelchair castor assemblies. The test methods include corrosion, abrasion and fatigue conditions. This document also specifies requirements for disclosure of test results.
    It is applicable to castor assemblies of or developed for use in occupant and to assistant-propelled manual wheelchairs and electrically powered wheelchairs.
    The test requirements are also applicable to wheelchair castor assemblies not necessarily associated or supplied with a wheelchair.
    Castor assemblies including those with anti-tip castor wheels that do not touch the ground during wheelchair travel are outside the scope of this document.
