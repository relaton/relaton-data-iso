  script: Latn
  content: "ISO/IEC 29341-20-11:2017 is compliant with the UPnP Device Architecture
    version 1.0 [14].\nThis service-type enables modeling of streaming capabilities
    of A/V devices, and binding of those capabilities between devices. Each device
    that is able to send or receive a stream according to the UPnP AV Architecture
    will have 1 instance of the ConnectionManager service. This service provides a
    mechanism for control points to:\na)         Perform capability matching between
    source/server devices and sink/renderer devices,\nb)         Find information
    about currently ongoing transfers in the network,\nc)         Setup and teardown
    connections between devices (when required by the streaming protocol).\nThe ConnectionManager
    service is generic enough to properly abstract different kinds of streaming mechanisms,
    such as HTTP-based streaming, RTSP/RTP-based and 1394-based streaming.  \nThe
    ConnectionManager enables control points to abstract from physical media interconnect
    technology when making connections. The term ?stream' used in this service template
    refers to both analog and digital data transfer."
