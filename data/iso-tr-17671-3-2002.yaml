abstract:
- content: "ISO/TR 17671-3 gives general guidance for the satisfactory production
    and control of welding and details the possible detrimental phenomena that may
    occur with advice on methods by which they may be avoided. It is generally applicable
    to all stainless steels and is appropriate regardless of the type of fabrication
    involved, although the application standard may have additional requirements.
    Permissible design stresses in welds, methods of testing and acceptance levels
    are not included because they depend on the service conditions of fabrication.
    \nThis part of ISO/TR 17671 gives general recommendations for the fusion welding
    of stainless steels. Specific details relevant to austenitic, austenitic-ferritic,
    ferritic and martensitic stainless steels are given in annexes A to D."
