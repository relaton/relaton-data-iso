abstract:
- content: |-
    ISO/IEC 15054:2003 specifies the signalling protocol for the support of the additional network feature Call Interception (ANF-CINT) at the Q reference point between Private Integrated services Network eXchanges (PINX) connected together within a Private Integrated Services Network (PISN).
    ANF-CINT is an additional network feature which enables calls that cannot be completed due to certain conditions to be redirected to a predetermined intercepted-to user.
    The Q reference point is defined in ISO/IEC 11579-1.
    Service specifications are produced in three stages and according to the method specified in ETS 300 387. ISO/IEC 15054:2003 contains the stage 3 specification for the Q reference point and satisfies the requirements identified by the stage 1 and stage 2 specifications in ISO/IEC 15053.
    The signalling protocol for ANF-CINT operates on top of the signalling protocol for basic circuit switched call control, as specified in ISO/IEC 11572, and uses certain aspects of the generic procedures for the control of supplementary services specified in ISO/IEC 11582.
    ISO/IEC 15054:2003 also specifies additional signalling protocol requirements for the support of interactions at the Q reference point between ANF-CINT and other supplementary services and ANFs.
    NOTE Additional interactions that have no impact on the signalling protocol at the Q reference point can be found in the relevant stage 1 specifications.
    ISO/IEC 15054:2003 is applicable to PINXs which can interconnect to form a PISN.
