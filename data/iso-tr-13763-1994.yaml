abstract:
- content: Offers guidance towards the preparation of future gas cylinder standards,
    revisions to existing gas cylinder standards, and identifies aspects of design
    criteria and tests which are recognized as providing information relevant to the
    safety and performance in service of seamless gas cylinders of water capacities
    between 0,5 l and 150 l. These principles shall also be applied, where possible,
    to cylinders with water capacities outside of the limits stated. Where applicable
    guidance is given on recommended procedures and limiting requirements.
