    1.1 This International Standard describes methods for evaluating the effectiveness of chemical conversion
    treatments intended to increase the resistance of wet-processed silver images to oxidation. The treatment may be
    applied as part of the original processing, or it may be a post-processing treatment.
    This International Standard does not recommend general or specific treatments for silver images. Likewise,
    treatment temperature, times and replenishment rates are outside the scope of this International Standard. Factors
    to be considered in a stabilizing treatment are discussed in informative annex B.
    Two test methods are described: the "dichromate bleach test" and the "hydrogen peroxide incubation test" (see [7]
    in the bibliography). The significance of each is discussed in informative annex C.
    1.2 This International Standard is applicable to silver-gelatin images coated on supports of either plastic, paper
    or glass.
