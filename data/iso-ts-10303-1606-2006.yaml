    ISO/TS 10303-1606:2006 specifies the application module for AP210 assembly physical design.
    ISO/TS 10303-1606:2006 deals with the representation of assembly physical design. This data includes all data that defines the physical relationships between the components in the assembly. This data includes all the components that exist in the assembly, and specifies those that provide physical interfaces to the next level of assembly. Several types of assembly joint may be specified. Design re-use is explicitly supported with traceability. Complete traceability back to requirements is provided. This data identifies those components that do not meet design requirements. Appropriate elements of Geometric Dimensioning and Tolerancing are provided. This data includes both design view and usage view of the assembly. Configuration management information and design change management information is provided. This data includes at least one geometric representation.
    ISO/TS 10303-1606:2006 deals with the following:
    - assembly physical design;
    - detailed specification of joined features of components in the design;
    - detailed traceability of design requirements;
    - shape of assembly design;
    - configuration management of assembly design;
    - in-process change management of assembly design.
