  content: Specifications of a method for the determination of the indentation hardness
    of plastics by means of the Rockwell hardness tester using the Rockwell M, L and
    R hardness scales. The Rockwell hardness number is derived from the net increase
    in depth of impression as the load on an indentor is increased from a fixed minor
    load to a major load and then returned to the same minor load. For materials having
    high creep and recovery, the time-factors involved in application of the major
    and minor loads have a considerable effect on the results of the measurements.
