    ISO 16130:2015 applies to the dynamic testing of the locking behaviour of bolted connections in order to investigate the self-loosening behaviour of fasteners for aerospace applications and is mainly intended for development work.
    As test apparatuses are different (e.g. stiffness distribution), testing in accordance with this International Standard, therefore, does not allow an absolute statement to be made on the locking behaviour of bolted assemblies under service loads.
    Thus, the objective of this test is a comparative evaluation of locking elements under defined test conditions.
