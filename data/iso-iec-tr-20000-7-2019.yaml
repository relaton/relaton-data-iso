    This document provides guidance on the integrated implementation of a service management system (SMS) as specified in ISO/IEC 20000-1 with a quality management system (QMS) as specified in ISO 9001 and an information security management system (ISMS) as specified in ISO/IEC 27001. It is aimed at those organizations that are intending to either:
    a)    implement ISO 9001 when ISO/IEC 20000-1 is already implemented, or vice versa;
    b)    implement ISO/IEC 27001 when ISO/IEC 20000-1 is already implemented, or vice versa;
    c)    implement both ISO 9001 and ISO/IEC 20000-1 together, or implement both ISO/IEC 27001 and ISO/IEC 20000-1 together;
    d)    implement ISO/IEC 20000-1, ISO 9001 and ISO/IEC 27001 together; or
    e)    integrate existing management systems based on ISO/IEC 20000-1, ISO 9001 and ISO/IEC 27001.
    In practice, an SMS, QMS or ISMS can also be integrated with other management system standards (MSS), such as ISO 22301 or ISO 55001.
    Clause 4 provides an introduction to ISO/IEC 20000-1, the HLS of MSS specified in ISO/IEC Directives Part 1 and considerations for the integration of an MSS.
    Clause 5 provides an introduction to ISO 9001, commonalities and differences with ISO/IEC 20000-1 and considerations for the integration of an SMS with a QMS.
    Clause 6 provides an introduction to ISO/IEC 27001, commonalities and differences with ISO/IEC 20000-1 and considerations for the integration of an SMS with an ISMS.
    Clause 7 looks at considerations for the integration of an SMS, a QMS, and an ISMS.
    This document also provides correlation information for the terms and definitions of ISO/IEC 20000-1 with ISO 9001 and ISO/IEC 27001 in Annex A. Correlation of the clauses of ISO/IEC 20000-1 with ISO 9001 is shown in Annex B. Correlation of the clauses of ISO/IEC 20000-1 with ISO/IEC 27001 is shown in Annex C.
