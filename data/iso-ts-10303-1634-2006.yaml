abstract:
- content: "ISO/TS 10303-1634:2006 specifies the application module for\n         Assembly
    component placement requirements.       \n         \n      \n\n      \n         ISO/TS
    10303-1634:2006 deals with the representation of information needed to describe
    the \n            \t   constraints restricting where components are to be placed
    in an assembly. \n            \t   These restrictions may be to keep components
    within a region, or may be restrictions to keep components out of a region.\n
    \           \n            \t   Components may be grouped and requirements assigned
    to a group.\n            \t   Constraints may be applied between specific categories
    of components.\n            \t     Items which are considered by the responsible
    organization to be \n            \t   the basis of the requirement may be identified.\n
    \           \t   Module attribute data population is restricted to that related
    to the discrete assembly view.  \n               \n         \n\n         The following
    are within the scope of \n         ISO/TS 10303-1634:2006:\n         \n      \n-
    grouping of components for placement purposes;\n- identification of component
    groups;\n- classification of components for placement purposes;\n- assignment
    of spacing requirements to component classes;\n- identification of restriction
    areas on the interconnect substrate;\n- identification of restriction volumes
    in the assembly;\n- assignment of component groups to restriction areas;\n- assignment
    of component groups to restriction volumes;\n- description of property based component
