    This part of ISO 10896 specifies safety requirements and verification for rough-terrain variable-reach trucks as defined in ISO 5053-1 (hereafter referred to as “trucks”) designed to tow trailers and/or equipment (hereafter referred to as “towed entities”) with a maximum design speed below or equal to 40 km/h (subcategory ‘a’).
    Note Local regulations can apply when trucks are used to tow towed entities on public roads.
    This Standard does not cover:
    - trucks intended to tow a towed entity equipped with complex electronic control systems for braking or electronically controlled braking system (EBS)
    - differential braking function
    - vacuum braking systems
    - trucks intended to tow a towed entity equipped with an anti-lock braking system (ABS)
    - endurance braking systems
    This document does not provide requirements for towed entities.
