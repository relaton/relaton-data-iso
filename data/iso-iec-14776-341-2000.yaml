abstract:
- content: 'This International Standard defines the command set extensions for SCSI-3
    storage array devices; commonly known as RAID devices. This standard is principally
    intended to be used in conjunction with, not as an alternate to, any of the SCSI-3
    command standards and the SCSI-3 Architecture Model Standard (ISO/IEC IS 14776-411).
    The resulting commands facilitate the control and configuration of SCSI-3 storage
    arrays and thus provide a common command specification for both system integrators
    and suppliers of SCSI-3 storage array devices. The clause(s) of this standard
    pertaining to the SCSI-3 storage array device class, implemented in conjunction
    with the applicable clauses within any of the SCSI-3 command standards, shall
    specify the standard command set available for SCSI-3 storage arrays. The objectives
    of the SCSI-3 Controller Commands is to provide the following: a) Transfer commands
    unique to SCSI-3 Controller Command devices; b) Control commands to manage the
    operation of an SCSI-3 Controller Command device; c) Optional device mapping and
    pass-through support.'
