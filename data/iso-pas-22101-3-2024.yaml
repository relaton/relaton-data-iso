    This document specifies the fittings made from short glass fibre reinforced polyethylene (PE-sGF) manufactured by the spiral cross winding method used below ground for the conveyance of fluids in the following industrial and agricultural contexts:
    —     chemical plants;
    —     industrial sewerage engineering;
    —     power engineering (cooling and general-purpose water supply);
    —     agricultural production plants;
    —     water treatment;
    —     small hydraulic power plants (general-purpose water supply).
    This document also specifies the test parameters for the test methods it references.
    In conjunction with the other parts of the ISO  22101 series, this document is applicable to PE-sGF fittings, and to joints with components of PE-sGF or other materials, intended to be used under the following conditions:
    a)       a maximum allowable operating pressure (PFA) up to and including 25 bar;1)
    b)       an operating temperature of 20 °C as the reference temperature.
    NOTE 1        For other operating temperatures, guidance is given in ISO/PAS 22101-1:2022, Annex A.
    This document covers a range of maximum allowable operating pressures and gives requirements concerning colours and additives.
    NOTE 2        It is the responsibility of the purchaser or specifier to make the appropriate selections from these aspects, taking into account their particular requirements and any relevant national guidance or regulations and installation practices or codes.
    This document is applicable to fittings of the following types:
    —     electrofusion socket fittings;
    —     loose backing flanges and flange adapters;
    —     fabricated fittings (see Annex A).
