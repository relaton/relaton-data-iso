abstract:
- content: This document specifies requirements for the preparation, execution and
    reporting of speed trials of ships of the displacement type with a length between
    perpendiculars (Lpp) from 50 metres to 500 metres. It provides a procedure for
    the analysis, evaluation and correction of the gathered speed trial data covering
    all influences that can be relevant to the individual trial runs reporting on
    speed trials for ships, including effects that can influence the speed, power
    and propeller shaft speed relationship.
