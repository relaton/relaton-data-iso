abstract:
- content: |-
    This document specifies user interfaces (UIs) designed for full duplex (FDX) speech interaction. It also specifies the FDX speech interaction model, features, functional components and requirements, thus providing a framework to support natural conversational interfaces between humans and machines. It also provides privacy considerations for applying FDX speech interaction.
    This document is applicable to UIs for speech interaction and communication protocols for setting up a session-oriented FDX interaction between humans and machines.
    This document does not define the speech interaction engines themselves or specify the details of specific engines, devices and approaches.
