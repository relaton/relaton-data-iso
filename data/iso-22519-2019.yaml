    This document specifies design, materials selection, construction and operation of Purified Water (PW) and Water for Injection (WFI) pretreatment and membrane-based production systems.
    As many different types of feed water are possible, different components and configurations are presented. A decision matrix is provided to give guidance for the different types of feed water.
    This document excludes
    —          selection of the appropriate compendial water definition per system: e.g. PW, WFI or other;
    —          thermal process for generation of PW/WFI;
    —          loops, storage and distribution;
    —          pure steam generation and distribution;
    —          laboratory water systems and
    —          validation.
