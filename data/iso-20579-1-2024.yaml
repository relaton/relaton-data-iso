    This document identifies the information needed to ensure that a sample has been selected, processed, handled, and stored in a manner consistent with the analysis objectives, and to ensure the reliability and reproducibility of the surface analyses. Such information is also an important component of sample data record books, datasheets, certificates of analysis, reports, and other publications. This information is in addition to other details associated with the specimens to be analysed, such as source/synthesis information, processing history, and other characterizations that naturally become part of the data record (sometimes referred to as provenance information) regarding the origin of the sample and any changes to its original form.
    This document also includes normative annexes as an aid to understanding the special sample handling techniques and storage requirements of surface chemical analysis techniques, particularly: Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The information presented can also be applicable for other analytical techniques, such as total reflection X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (TXRF), that is sensitive to surface composition, and scanning probe microscopy (SPM), that is sensitive to surface morphology.
    This document does not define the nature of instrumentation or operating procedures needed to ensure that the analytical measurements described have been appropriately conducted.
