    This document defines transport and container formats for JPEG XS codestreams as specified in ISO/IEC 21122-1. It defines file formats for working with still image and motion image sequence files on computer platforms and gives guidance on how to embed the codestream in transport streams, allowing internet-based communication.
    This document uses already existing specifications for file formats and extends them for the embedding of JPEG XS codestreams.
