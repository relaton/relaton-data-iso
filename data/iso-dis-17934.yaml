abstract:
- content: "Scope of the proposed deliverable\n\nThis document focuses on recommended
    condition monitoring techniques for detecting and diagnosing developing machine
    faults associated with the most common potential failure modes for reciprocating
    compressors. It is intended to improve the reliability of implementing an effective
    condition monitoring approach for the compressors. It is also intended to help
    create a mutual understanding of the criteria for successful reciprocating compressor
    condition monitoring and to foster cooperation between the various application
    stakeholders.\n\nThis document is intended for end-users, contractors, consultants,
    service providers, machine and parts manufacturers and instrument suppliers.\n\nThe
    condition monitoring and diagnostics strategy and techniques described in this
    standard technically apply to reciprocating compressors with many different machine
    configurations (e.g. vertical/horizontal/L-type/V-type/W-type cylinder orientation,
    number of stages, speed range, lubrication, capacity control, cylinder cooling,
    etc.) and used in many different industrial applications. From a cost benefits
    perspective, however, this standard is most relevant for critical, possibly un-spared
    units and/or medium to large sized units that are over 1000 kW. \nAs the vast
    majority of these types of reciprocating compressors are used primarily in the
    hydrocarbon processing and natural gas industry, the focus will be on these applications
    but this by no means excludes critical applications in other industries. \n\nThis
    standard focuses on the compressor itself (cylinders, distance pieces, frame and
    all internal parts) and not on the driver or the external systems such as foundation/skid/pedestal,
    piping, scrubbers, pulsation vessels, and pulsation control devices. The scope
    does not include monitoring the auxiliary systems such as for lubrication, cylinder
    cooling, intercoolers and gas purging, but process parameters from these systems
    are often monitored. The scope doesn’t cover installation analyses of systems
    either, such as pulsation and mechanical response analysis of the piping, thermal
    analysis of piping, etc. \n\nThis document covers online (permanently installed)
    and portable instrument condition monitoring and diagnostic techniques for operational
    reciprocating compressors during steady-state and transient conditions. Machine
    testing, i.e. that which is only done during shutdown, although very important,
    is not part of the scope of this document. Nor is one-time acceptance and performance
    testing within the scope. The condition monitoring techniques presented in this
    document cover a wide range of continuous and interval-based monitoring techniques
    under generalized conditions for a wide range of applications. The actual monitoring
    approach required, however, can be different from one application to another."
