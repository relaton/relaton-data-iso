abstract:
- content: Specifies geometrical tests for these general purpose and normal accuracy
    broaching machines and gives the corresponding permissible deviations apply. Gives
    also the terminology used for the main elements of the machine (in English, French
    and Russian as well as the equivalent terms in German and Italian). It deals only
    with the verification of accuracy of the machine. It does not apply to the testing
    of the running of the machine, nor to machine characteristics which should generally
    be checked before the accuracy is tested.
