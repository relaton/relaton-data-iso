abstract:
- content: |-
    This document provides requirements and guidance on the application of system and software engineering processes to systems for epidemic prevention and control.
    This document provides guidance that can be employed for adopting and applying system and software life cycle processes within an organization or a project in an epidemic emergency. It includes system of systems considerations in the context of epidemic emergency.
    This document applies to acquisition, supply, development, operation, maintenance, and disposal (whether performed internally or externally to an organization) of system or system of systems in an epidemic emergency.
    Many of the requirements and recommendations in this document are also applicable to other systems developed rapidly to respond to emergency conditions affecting the public.
