- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "The need exists to identify the data carrier a reader detects in autodiscrimination
    environments. The Symbology Identifier concept provides a standardized way for
    a device receiving data from a reader to differentiate between the data carriers.
    ISO/IEC 15424:2008 deals mostly with bar code symbologies; the terms Symbology
    Identifier, symbology, and bar code are therefore used throughout ISO/IEC 15424:2008
    although they are intended to apply to other data carriers as well. \nThis identification
    is achieved by the addition of an optional feature to readers enabling the reader
    to prefix a standard string of characters to data messages. This preamble contains
    information about the decoded symbol (or other data carrier) and any processing
    the reader has done. The information is not encoded or otherwise explicitly or
    implicitly represented in the symbol, except that the presence of some optional
    features may be detected by the reading equipment, whereas others require the
    reader to be expressly configured to implement them.\nISO/IEC 15424:2008 should
    be read in conjunction with the relevant symbology specifications.\nISO/IEC 15424:2008
    applies to automatic identification device communication conventions and standardizes
    the reporting of data carriers from bar code readers and other automatic identification
    equipment. It specifies a preamble message generated by the reader and interpretable
    by the receiving system, which indicates the bar code symbology or other origin
    of transmitted data, together with details of certain specified optional processing
    features associated with the data message."
