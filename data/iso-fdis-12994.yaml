abstract:
- content: This document specifies the specification and test requirements of decorative
    and electrodeposited metallic coatings for automobile plastic parts. The specification
    consists of the physicochemical property of the selected substrate, the type of
    deposited nickel and chromium, the thickness of coatings and the appearance of
    coatings. The test requirements consist of the requirements of potential difference
    test, adhesion test, stress test, temperature resistance test and accelerated
    corrosion test.
