  content: Relates to nine grades of flake graphite austenitic cast iron and eleven
    grades of spheroidal or nodular graphite austenitic cast iron intended for subsequent
    use in the manufacture of castings. These grades of material are based on chemical
    composition and mechanical properties. Specifies symbols, production, properties
    and applications, sampling, test samples, testing and retests. An informative
    annex gives supplementary data on mechanical and physical properties and typical
    applications.
