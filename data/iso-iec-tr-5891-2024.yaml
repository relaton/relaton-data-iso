  content: "This document surveys and summarizes the existing hardware monitoring
    methods, including research efforts and industrial applications. The explored
    monitoring technologies are classified by applied area, carrier type, target entity,
    objective pattern, and method of deployment. Moreover, this document summarizes
    the possible ways of utilizing monitoring technologies for hardware security assessment
    with some existing state-of-the-art security assessment approaches. \nThe hardware
    mentioned in this document refers only to the core processing hardware, such as
    the central processing unit (CPU), microcontroller unit (MCU), and system on a
    chip (SoC), in the von Neumann system and does not include single-input or single-output
    devices such as memory or displays.\nThe hardware monitoring technology discussed
    in this document has the following considerations and restrictions:\n—     the
    monitored target is for the post-silicon phase, not for the design-house phase
    (e.g. an RTL or netlist design);\n—     monitoring is only applied to the runtime
    system."
