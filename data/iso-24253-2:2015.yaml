abstract:
- content: |-
    ISO 24253-2:2015 specifies a method for field measurements to determine the quantity and distribution of spray in a field crop, treated by horizontal boom sprayers with downward directed application. It can be used for nursery trees and small size bush crops (young currants) when sprayed with boom sprayers.
    NOTE   When interested in the spray deposition over width of the crop canopy, it is advised to use ISO 22522.
    ISO 24253-2:2015 allows flexibility in the arrangement of field tests, but specifies standardized measurement procedures that are useful to be able to compare the results from different field experiments or to compare with laboratory tests, such as that specified in ISO 5682-2.
    ISO 24253 is not intended for use in or for a regulatory framework.
