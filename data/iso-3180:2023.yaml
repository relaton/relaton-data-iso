- content: |-
    This document specifies wet chemical and inductively coupled plasma–optical emission spectrometry (ICP–OES)-based methods for the chemical analysis of calcium-phosphate-based powders for non-biomedical applications, such as those in the chemical industry, the treatment of air, water and soil contamination.
    It stipulates the methods used for the determination of major elements of calcium-phosphate-based powders and their impurities. Calcium-phosphate-based powders are decomposed by acid decomposition. The calcium content is determined using a titration method or an ICP–OES method. The phosphorus content is determined using a precipitation and gravimetric method or an ICP–OES method. Certain impurities, such as aluminium, barium, chromium, copper, iron, magnesium, manganese, nickel, potassium, selenium, silicon, sodium, strontium, titanium and zinc contents, are determined by an ICP–OES method.
    This document does not include calcium-phosphate-based powders for biomedical applications. The ISO 13779 series characterizes hydroxyapatite powders for biomedical applications using various methods, such as atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS), inductively coupled plasma–mass spectrometry (ICP–MS) and flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS).
