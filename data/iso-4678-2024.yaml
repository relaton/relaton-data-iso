    This document provides the instrumentation requirements and measurement procedures for measuring noise from HVAC systems in ship accommodation spaces.
    Accommodation spaces are defined according to ISO 2923, and include cabins, offices (for carrying out ship’s business), hospitals, messrooms and recreation rooms.
    Measurement of noise levels in HVAC systems in ship accommodation is performed in the third octave band over the frequency range from 63 Hz to 8 kHz, taking into account the correction of cabin reverberation.
