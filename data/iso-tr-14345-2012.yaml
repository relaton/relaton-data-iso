    ISO/TR 14345:2012 gives guidance on best practice for fatigue testing under constant- or variable-amplitude loading of welded components in the medium- and high-cycle regimes, corresponding to applied loading that results in nominal stresses that do not exceed yield. Low-cycle fatigue testing under strain control is not specifically covered, although the same test specimens can be suitable for either low- or high-cycle fatigue testing. The different steps involved in the manufacture and preparation of the welded specimens and the final presentation and evaluation of the test results are also covered.
    ISO/TR 14345:2012 does not cover corrosion or high-temperature fatigue testing.
