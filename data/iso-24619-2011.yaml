abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "ISO 24619:2011 specifies requirements for the persistent identifier (PID)
    framework and for using PIDs as references and citations of language resources
    in documents as well as in language resources themselves. In this context, examples
    of language resources include such works as digital dictionaries, language-purposed
    terminological resources, machine-translation lexica, annotated multimedia/multimodal
    corpora, text corpora that have been annotated with, for example, morpho-syntactic
    information, and the like. Computational and applied linguists and information
    specialists create such resources. \nISO 24619:2011 also addresses issues of persistence
    and granularity of references to resources, first by requiring that persistent
    references be implemented by using a PID framework and further by imposing requirements
    on any PID frameworks used for this purpose. \nPID frameworks also allow the association
    of general metadata with the identifier, which can also contain citation information.
    ISO 24619:2011 specifies minimum requirements for effective use of PIDs in language
    resources and cites the use of several possible existing standards and de-facto
    standards."
