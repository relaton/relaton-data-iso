abstract:
- content: "This standard will specify a large-scale fire test method for measuring
    the heat release rates (HRR) and the smoke-production rates (SPR) of wall systems.
    The fire scenario covered in this document is representative of severe fires originating
    in near wall or corner locations of an exterior or interior wall construction.
    Severe fire exposure to wall systems, on the order of 100 kW/m2 heat flux, are
    targeted in this test method. For this standard, the test setup is placed under
    an ISO 24473 compliant large-scale calorimeter of a minimum 3.5 MW chemical HRR
    capacity. An existing large-scale fire test, viz. the 16-ft parallel panel test
    (16-ft PPT) of the consensus ASNI/FM 4880 standard, is submitted to be used as
    the basis of the proposed ISO standard.  \nThe test method is not applicable for
    scenarios where a fire initiates within an air cavity, if present, of an exterior
    wall system. The test method does not incorporate a window structure and hence
    cannot cover the hazard from inadequately protected window openings in a post-flashover
    fire scenario."
