abstract:
- content: |-
    This document specifies requirements for the biobanking of human mesenchymal stromal cells derived from bone marrow (hBM-MSCs), including the collection of bone marrow and associated data, isolation, culture, characterization, quality control, cryopreservation, storage, thawing, disposal, distribution and transport.
    This document is applicable to all organizations performing biobanking with hBM-MSCs used for research.
    This document does not apply to hBM-MSCs for the purpose of in vivo application in humans, cell therapy, clinical applications, tissue engineering or therapeutic use.
    NOTE      International, national or regional regulations or requirements, or multiple of them, can also apply to specific topics covered in this document.
