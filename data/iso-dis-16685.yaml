abstract:
- content: This document specifies the equipment and procedures for determining the
    mechanical properties at sub-ambient temperatures (−196°C to 25°C), subject to
    the possible temperature limitation of the test specimens. It is not applicable
    to products which experience dimensional changes during the test due to the loss
    of hydration water or which undergo other phase changes.
