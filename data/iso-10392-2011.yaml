    ISO 10392:2011 specifies methods for determining the location of the centre of gravity (CG) of a road vehicle, as defined in ISO 3833. A method for determining the coordinates of the CG in the horizontal plane is provided. Two methods for determining the height of the CG above the ground are specified.
    The axle lift and the stable pendulum methods are the most common methods for determining vehicle CG height. The axle lift method requires less dedicated equipment and is typically an easier and less expensive method than the stable pendulum method. The axle lift method can generally provide CG height accuracy in the range of a few percent, while the stable pendulum method can provide accuracy in the range of 0,5%.
