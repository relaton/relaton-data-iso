abstract:
- content: ISO 17123-8:2007 specifies field procedures to be adopted when determining
    and evaluating the precision (repeatability) of Global Navigation Satellite System
    (GNSS) field measurement systems (this includes GPS, GLONASS as well as the future
    systems like GALILEO) in real-time kinematic (GNSS RTK) and their ancillary equipment
    when used in building, surveying and industrial measurements. Primarily, these
    tests are intended to be field verifications of the suitability of a particular
    instrument for the required application at hand, and to satisfy the requirements
    of other standards. They are not proposed as tests for acceptance or performance
    evaluations that are more comprehensive in nature.
