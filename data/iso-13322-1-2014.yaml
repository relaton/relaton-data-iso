    ISO 13322-1:2014 is applicable to the analysis of images for the purpose of determining particle size distributions where the velocity of the particles against the axis of the optical system of the imaging device is zero. The particles are appropriately dispersed and fixed in the object plane of the instrument. The field of view may sample the object plane dynamically either by moving the sample support or the camera provided this can be accomplished without any motion effects on the image. Captured images can be analysed subsequently.
    ISO 13322-1:2014 concentrates upon the analysis of digital images created from either light or electron detection systems. It considers only image evaluation methods using complete pixel counts.
