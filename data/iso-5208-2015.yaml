    ISO 5208:2015 specifies examinations and tests that a valve manufacturer needs to act upon in order to establish the integrity of the pressure boundary of an industrial metallic valve and to verify the degree of valve closure tightness and the structural adequacy of its closure mechanism. This International Standard is intended to be applied in conjunction with the specific requirements of a valve product standard to the extent cited by the product standard as a normative reference. Where requirements of a product standard differ from those given in this International Standard, the requirements of the product standard apply.
    ISO 5208:2015 is not applicable to the safety aspects of pressure testing.
