  content: Specifies a test method to determine the maximum capacity of a mobile crane
    to counterbalance loads applied on its hook block. The test is applicable for
    cranes whose capacity to support loads is based on its static resistance to overturning.
    The test shall not be used on cranes whose capacity is based on structural strenght
    or on limitations due to available load hoist, jib hoist or jib telescope capability.
    Applies to all mobile cranes as defined in ISO 4306-2.
