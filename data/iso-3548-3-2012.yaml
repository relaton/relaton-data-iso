    This part of ISO 3548 specifies, according to ISO 12301, the checking of the peripheral length of thin-walled half bearings with or without flange, and describes the necessary checking methods and measuring equipment.
    Thin-walled half bearings are flexible and, in the free condition, do not conform to a cylindrical profile. This is one reason the peripheral length of the half bearings can only be measured under a constraining load by use of specialized measuring equipment.
    In addition, measuring equipment different from that illustrated in this part of ISO 3548 can be used, provided the measuring accuracy of the equipment is consistent with the specifications given in Clause 17.
    This part of ISO 3548 does not include measurement of the parting line taper.
    This part of ISO 3548 applies to thin-walled half bearings, the specifications of which are given in ISO 3548-1
