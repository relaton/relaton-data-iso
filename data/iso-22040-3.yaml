abstract:
- content: The proposed document provides the life cycle management of concrete structures
    particularly focusing on the execution stage on the basis of the framework and
    general principles specified by ISO 22040. This document is applicable to not
    only newly constructed structures but also existing structures when their life
    cycle is restarted. This document specifies on how performance requirements should
    be considered at the execution stage and also how the basic LCM scenario should
    be updated. Management items at the execution stage are clearly defined and information
    that may be fed back to the design stage and be transferred to the use stage is
    described.
