    ISO 19595:2017 specifies the properties and requirements of aggregates obtained by processing natural materials and mixtures of these aggregates for use in concrete. It is applicable to aggregates with an oven-dried particle density greater than 2,00 Mg/m3 (2 000 kg/m3) in accordance with ISO 22965 (all parts).
    ISO 19595:2017 incorporates a general requirement that natural aggregates are not intended to release any harmful substances in excess of the maximum permitted levels specified for the material or permitted in the national regulations of the place in use.
    National provisions, preferably given in a national annex or a project specification, can specify additional or deviating requirements.
    NOTE          Requirements for the end use of aggregates in concrete are specified in ISO 22965 (all parts).
