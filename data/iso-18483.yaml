  content: "This document specifies the rating requirements, published ratings and
    marking provisions of centrifugal refrigerant compressors. This document applies
    to centrifugal compressors and their performance in heating, ventilation and air-conditioning
    applications. \nThis document provides guidance and requirements for the industry,
    including manufacturers, engineers, installers and contractors. It defines the
    minimum amount of information in a standardized form to enable the evaluation
    and comparison of different compressors for use in an application and suggests
    a method to be used to guarantee the accuracy of that information."
