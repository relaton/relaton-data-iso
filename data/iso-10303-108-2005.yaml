abstract:
- content: "ISO 10303-108:2005 specifies the resource constructs for the representation
    of model parameters and constraints in CAD or other kinds of models, together
    with the mechanisms necessary for associating them with geometric or other elements
    of transferred models. The use of these capabilities potentially allows certain
    aspects of the behaviour of a model in its originating system to be conveyed together
    with the basic model itself. The intention in transferring this additional information
    is to provide the receiving system with data that will enable it to reconstruct
    corresponding behavioural characteristics in the model following the transfer.
    Ideally, this will enable the model to be edited in the receiving system just
    as as though it had been created there. That would not be possible without the
    exchange of what is known as design intent information. ISO 10303-108:2005 enables
    the capture and transfer of an important aspect of design intent.\nThe following
    are within the scope of ISO 10303-108:2005:\n- parameterization of models through
    the association of variables with quantities occurring in them, including dimensional
    values; \n- constraints defining mathematical relationships between variable parameters;
    \n- constraints on models expressed as descriptive relationships between their
    constituent elements or attributes of those elements; \n- specialized descriptive
    constraints corresponding to the geometric constraints commonly used in product
    shape modelling (e.g., parallelism or tangency between geometric elements); \n-
    applications of parameterization and constraints to two- and three-dimensional
    shape models; \n- specialized representations for two-dimensional geometric sketches
    or profiles; \n- representation of models that are incompletely defined in the
    sense that certain values in the model may be regarded as not fully constrained.
    \nThe following are outside the scope of ISO 10303-108:2005:\n- procedural or
    history-based model representations, expressed in terms of sequences of constructional
    operations; \n- implicit or procedurally defined constraints, inherent in the
    operation of constructional operations; \n- solution methods for systems of constraint
    equations; \n- form features of shape models; \n- behaviour of a system in which
    a variational model is edited following a transfer; \n- considerations of accuracy
    in constraint satisfaction. \nThe following notes apply to the excluded capabilities."
