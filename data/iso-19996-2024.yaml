  content: "This document specifies requirements and provides guidance for the use
    of charge conditioners for aerosol particles, especially for particle characterization
    and for the generation of calibration and test aerosols.\nThis document provides
    a methodology to specify the performance of charge conditioners and for adequate
    quality control, with respect to their application in:\n— particle size and concentration
    measurement with differential mobility analysing systems (DMAS);\n—particle size
    classification with differential electrical mobility classifiers (DEMC). \nFor
    these applications, this document covers particle charge conditioning for particle
    sizes ranging from approximately 1 nm to 1 µm and for particle number concentrations
    at the inlet of the charge conditioner up to approximately 107 cm-3.\nThis document
    does not address specific charge conditioner designs or other applications besides
    those specified in Clause 1.\nRadiation safety for charge conditioners with radioactive
    sources or x-ray tubes is not covered by this document."
