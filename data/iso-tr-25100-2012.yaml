    ISO TR 25100:2012 provides guidance on the harmonisation of data concepts that are being managed by data registry and data dictionaries such as those described in ISO 14817:2002.
    ISO TR 25100:2012 describes processes for harmonisation of such data concepts to arrive at preferred definitions for use in formal standards, specifications, technical reports and information models. It is based on consideration of a harmonisation process used by international groups involved in the ITS sector and in the wider sector of transport and logistics information and control systems.
