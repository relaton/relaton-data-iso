  content: "1.1  Fields of application  \nThese Service Delivery guidelines are applicable
    to Very Small Entities (VSEs). A VSE is an enterprise, an organization, a department
    or a project having up to 25 people.\nISO/IEC TR 29110-5-3:2018 provides guidance
    to manage a set of services delivered to customers. The VSE can act as an internal
    service provider (providing services internal to the VSE) or as an external service
    provider (providing services commercially to external customers). These lifecycle
    processes (Governance, Service Control, Service Relationship and Service Incident)
    support and enhance the activities of software and system operations (further
    to development and installation) to create effective and efficient products and
    services.\nISO/IEC TR 29110-5-3:2018 provides guidance for Service Delivery. This
    document, when implemented, will assist and guide the VSE in the delivery of services
    which can benefit customers. This document does not promote uniformity in approach
    across all organizations as specific objectives and initiatives are tailored to
    suit an individual organization's needs.\nTasks described in this guideline document
    (and therefore activities and processes) are related by input/output relationships
    which imply a logical execution sequence. The order of presentation of the processes
    or the associated numbering scheme is for identification purposes only, NOT to
    indicate implementation or execution order. As every VSE is different; tasks can
    be implemented in an order that is suitable for the organization, while respecting
    the relationships between tasks.\nISO/IEC TR 29110-5-3:2018 is intended to be
    used by VSEs to establish processes to implement effective and efficient service
    delivery. This service delivery guidelines document can be used by VSEs that are
    offering only services to its customers or it can be combined with the information
    from ISO/IEC 29110 systems and/or software management and engineering guidelines."
