  content: "ISO 5344:2004 specifies the performance characteristics and performance
    test conditions for electrodynamic vibration generator systems and provides a
    list of additional equipment characteristics that can be declared by the equipment
    manufacturer. This information can be used by the user or the writer of specifications
    for equipment for the selection of such a system, taking into account its application.
    \nISO 5344:2004 establishes procedures for calculating the system performance
    of a system comprising an amplifier from one source and a vibrator from a different
    source. Such a calculated system performance is less precise than performance
    measured on a system comprising the actual vibrator and amplifier, and a reserve
    of calculated force is recommended. It can be desirable to specify separately
    the acquisition of needed vibrator and/or amplifier interface data, particularly
    if a vibrator or amplifier is to be acquired to add to an existing installation.
    It can also be desirable to specify the responsibility for the calculation of
    performance.\nISO 5344:2004 is applicable to equipment producing sine, random
    and impulse rectilinear vibration. It is implied that all systems are usable for
    sine testing at least at a low level, since sine capability is needed for specimen
    response evaluation and transfer function measurements for random and impulse
    testing. When random capability is specified, it is implied that some sine capability
    is also available. Similarly, when impulse capability is specified, it is implied
    that some sine, but not necessarily random, capability is available."
