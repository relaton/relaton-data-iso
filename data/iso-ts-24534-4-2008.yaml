  content: "ISO TS 24534-4:2008 provides the requirements for an Electronic Registration
    Identification (ERI) that is based on an identifier assigned to a vehicle (e.g.
    for recognition by national authorities) and suitable to be used for :\n- electronic
    identification of local and foreign vehicles by national authorities,\n- vehicle
    manufacturing, in-life-maintenance and end-of-life identification (vehicle life
    cycle management),\n- adaptation of vehicle data, e.g. in case of international
    re-sales,\n- safety related purposes,\n- crime reduction, and\n- commercial services.\nIt
    adheres to privacy and data protection regulations.\nISO TS 24534-4:2008 specifies
    the interfaces for a secure exchange of data between an ERT and an ERI reader
    or ERI writer in or outside the vehicle using asymmetric encryption techniques.
    It includes:\n- the application layer interface between an ERT and a onboard ERI
    reader or writer,\n- the application layer interface between the onboard ERI equipment
    and external ERI readers and writers, and\n- security issues related to the communication
    with the ERT. "
