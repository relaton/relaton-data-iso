    This document specifies requirements and test methods to assess the resistance to ignition by smouldering cigarette equivalent of integrated or non-integrated components of a wheelchair intended to protect tissue integrity and/or provide postural support. The electronic ignition source is also a simulation of other potential sources of environmental ignition hazards.
    The tests measure only the resistance to ignition of the items tested, and not the ignitability of the complete wheelchair. It gives an indication, but cannot guarantee, the ignition behaviour of the assembled devices of a complete wheelchair.
    This document does not apply to resistance to ignition of structural parts of a wheelchair. This document does not cover changes in resistance to ignition as a result of regular washing or use of the postural support devices.
    This document does not apply to the control of risks created by electrical and electronic components.
    This document allows for the separate testing of components of a wheelchair that are normally used in the horizontal plane (e.g. a seat cushion) from those normally used in the vertical plane (e.g. a back support).
    This document describes testing an assembly of the composite of materials as used in the component. The results of the tests in this document do not give any indication of the resistance to ignition of any of the separate individual materials of the test sample.
    NOTE      The intent of this document is primarily to address components that interface with the human body, such as cushions for positioning, or whose described purpose is that of protecting skin tissue against pressure, shear, and maceration related damage, as well as textile, foam, and plastic-based postural support devices.
