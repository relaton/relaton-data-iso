  content: "ISO/TS 17764-1:2002 specifies two methods for preparing the methyl esters
    of fatty acids of animal and vegetable fats, oils and fatty acid mixtures for
    raw materials for compound animal feeds, and fatty acids originating from fat
    extracts of animal feeding stuffs, including fats and fatty acid mixtures containing
    butyric acid. \nThe general method, the boron trifluoride (BF3) method is concerned
    with the preparation of methyl esters of fatty acids with six or more C atoms,
    originating from fats, oils and free fatty acids.\nThe KOH/HCl method is concerned
    with the preparation of methyl esters of fatty acids with four or more C atoms.
    This method can also be used for the quantitative determination of fatty acids
    with a chain length shorter than 10 C atoms in free fatty acid mixtures. \nThe
    methyl esters produced can be used for gas-liquid chromatography (GLC).\nUnsaponifiable
    materials are not removed and can, when present in considerable amounts, interfere
    with the chromatographic analysis.\nISO/TS 17764-2:2002 describes the application
    of gas chromatography with capillary columns and flame ionization detection for
    the determination of the content of fatty acids in a fat by making use of the
    methyl esters of the fatty acids obtained in accordance with the methods specified
    in ISO/TS 17764-1:2002."
