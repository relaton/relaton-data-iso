    ISO/TR 17068:2012 details the authorized custody services of a Trusted Third Party Repository (TTPR) in order to ensure provable integrity and authenticity of the clients' digital records and serve as a source of reliable evidence.
    It describes the services and processes to be provided by a TTPR for the clients' digital records during the retention period, to ensure trust. It also details the criteria of "trustworthiness" and the particular requirements of TTPR services, hardware and software systems, and management.
    ISO/TR 17068:2012 has the limitation that the authorized custody of the stored records is between only the third party and the client.
