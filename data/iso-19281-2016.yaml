    ISO 19281:2016 the minimum design and performance criteria and testing methods of passive fire resistant containers (FRCs) for carriage on aircraft main deck, to be used on either of the following:
    a)    in those cargo compartments of civil transport aircraft where they constitute one means of complying with applicable airworthiness regulations;
    b)    on a voluntary basis, when deemed appropriate by operators to improve fire protection in aircraft cargo compartments where airworthiness regulations do not currently mandate their use.
    The fire resistant containers (FRCs) specified by this International Standard are intended to be used to contain and restrain unitized cargo for loading into either of the following aircraft main deck cargo compartments:
    a)    Class B aircraft cargo compartments according to CS-25, CCAR-25, JAS Part 3 or 14CFR Part 25 25.857 (b), in accordance a) or b) above;
    b)    Class E aircraft cargo compartments according to CS-25, CCAR-25, JAS Part 3 or 14CFR Part 25 25.857 (e), in accordance with b) above;
    c)    Class F aircraft cargo compartments according to CS-25 § 25.857(f) and AMC to CS-25.855 and 25.857, or 14CFR Part 25 § 25.857(f) and FAA Advisory Circular AC25.857-X, in accordance with a) above.
    NOTE 1       Though nothing formally prevents a fire resistant container (FRC) from being carried in a lower deck Class C aircraft cargo compartment, it is not intended for this use since its fire containment capability would be redundant with that of the aircraft's fire detection and suppression system, which it could hamper. Consult current regulatory guidance materials and aircraft type's Weight and Balance Manual whenever available.
    Containers are specified in this International Standard only insofar as their flammability requirements and fire resistance performance are concerned. They are not otherwise specified in this International Standard, but still require meeting the applicable general standards.
    NOTE 2       See Clause 2 and 4.1 and 4.2 for applicable containers airworthiness approval and general design standards.
    This International Standard does not cover requirements for fire detection or suppression devices. The specified fire resistant containers (FRCs) are passive devices capable of containing a fire for the specified duration by themselves.
    NOTE 3       Nothing, however, prevents additional use of self-contained fire detection or suppression devices within fire resistant containers (FRCs), but such devices are not specified herein (see 4.5.5).
    ISO 19281:2016 does not cover requirements for other types of fire resistant containers not specified therein.
    The use of fire resistant containers meeting the requirements of this International Standard is not alone sufficient to ensure flight safety: this International Standard is based on the assumption that the approved fire resistant containers will be built up, installed, and checked prior to aircraft loading in accordance with appropriate operating instructions, by competent, suitably trained, personnel as defined for example in ISO 9001:2008, 6.2.2 (see 9.3).
