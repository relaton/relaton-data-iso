    to immovable cultural heritage through interventions arising from conservation,
    restoration or specific accessibility needs. It is applicable to immovable cultural
    heritage and its setting. It is not applicable to general management, organizational
    and other aspects of a functional nature that are not directly related to the
    conservation, restoration or specific accessibility interventions. This document
    is intended to be used by heritage owners and managers (both private or public),
    curators, accessibility professionals, conservation and restoration professionals,
    architects, engineers, designers, user representatives and builders. Requirements
    and recommendations related to the design and constructional aspects of an accessible
    built environment are covered by ISO 21542.
