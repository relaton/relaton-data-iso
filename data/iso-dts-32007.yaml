  content: "This document specifies how to extend the ISO 32000-2 specification by
    adding the ISO/IEC 12113 (glTF) format as a valid format for 3D artworks contained
    in a RichMedia annotation. It is intended for:\n\n•\tdevelopers of software that
    creates PDF files (PDF writers);\n•\tsoftware that reads existing PDF files and
    usually interprets their contents for display (PDF readers);\n•\tsoftware that
    reads and displays PDF content and interacts with the computer users to possibly
    modify and save the PDF file (PDF processors);\n•\tPDF products that read and/or
    write PDF files for a variety of other purposes (PDF processors).\n\nNote\tPDF
    writers and PDF readers are more specialised classifications of PDF processors.
    This document does not specify the following:\n•\tspecific processes for converting
    paper or electronic documents to the PDF file format;\n•\tspecific technical design,
    user interface implementation, or operational details of rendering;\n•\tspecific
    physical methods of storing these documents such as media and storage conditions;\n•\tmethods
    for validating the conformance of PDF files or PDF processors;\n•\trequired computer
    hardware and/or operating system."
