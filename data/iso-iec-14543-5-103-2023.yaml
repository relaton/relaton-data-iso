    This part of ISO/IEC 14543 specifies the application framework, device interaction process, request and response message formats and service description requirements to achieve intelligent grouping, resource sharing and service collaboration among various audio devices and controllers.
    This document is applicable to many types of audio devices with network connection capability. Networked audio devices can include a multi-room home audio system, a high-fidelity audio system, a home theatre, a smart radio, background audio, mobile audio and public audio equipment. Services specified by this document enable smart audio interconnection applications to interoperate seamlessly among audio devices and resource servers at home, in an office or in other remote environments. These services can include multi-device synchronization, sound configuration, audio on-demand service and music streaming and rendering.
