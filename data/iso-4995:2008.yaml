    ISO 4495:2008 applies to hot-rolled steel sheet of structural quality (grades HR235, HR275 and HR355; classes B and D), usually prepared without the use of microalloying elements. The product is intended for structural purposes where particular mechanical properties are required. It is generally used in the delivered condition and is intended for bolted, riveted or welded structures. This product is produced on a wide strip mill, not a plate mill.
    ISO 4495:2008 does not cover steels intended for boilers or pressure vessels, steels designated as commercial quality or drawing quality (covered in ISO 3573), steels to be re-rolled to cold‑reduced products, or steels designated as weathering steels, having increased atmospheric corrosion resistance.
