abstract:
- content: |-
    This document establishes the principles, instruments, sampling, experimental condition design, mechanical testing, calculation, and result reporting requirements and procedures for calculation of shale brittleness index based on the triaxial method for determining shale mechanical characteristics.
    This document is applicable to the testing and calculation of shale brittleness index in the assessment of reservoirs and selection of areas for marine shale gas exploration and development.
