abstract:
- content: "This document describes use cases related to seamless positioning systems
    for multimodal transportation in ITS stations. The use cases define the effectiveness
    of the seamless positioning concept model based on the P-ITS-S to conclude basic
    PVT service results using available sensors when mobility is moving indoor and
    outdoor in a network on/off situation. Use cases are provided for each stage in
    different environments, e.g. indoor, outdoor, tunnel and out-of-network area when
    travelling starts or ends. Within the use cases, the nomadic device implements
    a personal ITS station (P-ITS-S) to achieve compatibility with other ITS stations
    as referenced in this document.\nThe main purpose of this document is to describe
    the overall concept model, which specifies:\n—     the concept model and actors
    for each domain;\n—     the relationship of actors under the material domain;\n—    
    the message sequence diagrams for each domain; and\n—     the data transmission
    list for each actor to provide a seamless indoor and outdoor positioning system
    through sensor data fusion.\nIn addition, this document provides:\n—     basic
    principles used in its drafting; and\n—     a gap analysis, consisting of a formal
    study of:\n—    the status of seamless positioning technology and implementations,
    \n—    how seamless positioning technology intends to evolve, and \n—    how to
    close the gap between current and future technology and implementations. \n—    
    This document compares desired and actual outcomes and pinpoints opportunities
    for improvement."
