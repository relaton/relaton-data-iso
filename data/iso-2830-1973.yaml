  content: Applicable to products having a normal composition for which the molar
    ratio NaF/AlF3 is equal to about 3. Dissolution of a test portion in concentrated
    suphuric acid and elimination of hydrogen fluoride. Treatment with hydrochloric
    acid and water. Atomization of the solution into an acetylene measurement of the
    absorption of the 309.3 nm line emitted by an aluminium hollow cathode lamp. Has
    also been approved by the IUPAC.
