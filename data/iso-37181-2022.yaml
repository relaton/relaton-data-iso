abstract:
- content: |-
    This document describes the concept and goals of smart transportation by autonomous vehicles on public roads. It provides guidelines for the successful introduction and organisation of autonomous vehicles, with the aim of enhancing the safety of public road transportation and addressing the challenges to cities such as an aging population and diverse travel demands.
    This document focuses on the deployment of autonomous vehicles as an operational system for actual use on public roads. This document is intended for those in academia, autonomous vehicle developers, policy makers, research institutions, road infrastructure operators, public road administrators, testing inspection and certification bodies, and vehicle manufacturers.
    NOTE 1   This document targets autonomous vehicle services except on-demand responsive services with shared vehicles. For on-demand responsive passenger services with shared vehicles, see ISO 37168.
    NOTE 2   A bus vehicle is shared by different passenger groups and can be chartered. A taxi vehicle is hired and can, if local regulations permit, be shared by different passenger groups.
