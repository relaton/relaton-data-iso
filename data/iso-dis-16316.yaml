abstract:
- content: "This document determines the resistance of windows (including skylights),
    doors, or curtain walling, to natural threats characterized by simulated destructive-windstorm
    events. The test method can also be used on windstorm protective systems for missile
    impact tests.\nThe test method determines the performance of windows, doors, or
    curtain walling, under conditions representative of events that occur in severe,
    destructive-windstorm environments using simulated missile impact(s) followed
    by the application of cyclic test load. \nA missile-propulsion device, an air
    pressure system, and a test chamber are used to model representative conditions
    that can be representative of windborne debris and pressures in a windstorm event.
    \nThe performance determined by this test method relates to the ability of building
    envelope components to fulfill the pass criteria listed in clause 8. \nThis test
    method is applicable to the design of entire windows (including skylights), and
    door or curtain walling, also in case these systems are tested in combination
    with windstorm protective system assemblies and their installation. \nException:
    \n-\tExterior garage doors and rolling doors are beyond the scope of this specification
    and this standard does not refer to bullet, blast, or flood resistance.\n-\tWindstorm
    protective systems when tested alone, i.e. not tested in combination with windows,
    skylights, doors or curtain walling. When windows, skylights, doors or curtain
    walling are tested in combination with windstorm protective systems, pass and
    fail assessment criteria (see clause 8), only refer to windows, skylights, doors
    or curtain walling themselves. No pass or fail criteria for windstorm protective
    systems are defined and covered by this standard."
