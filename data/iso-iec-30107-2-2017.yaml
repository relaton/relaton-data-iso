  content: |-
    ISO/IEC 30107-2:2017 defines data formats for conveying the mechanism used in biometric presentation attack detection and for conveying the results of presentation attack detection methods. The attacks considered in the ISO/IEC 30107 series take place at the sensor during the presentation and collection of the biometric characteristics. Any other attacks are outside the scope of this document.
    ISO/IEC 30107-2:2017 contains the following data formats: a binary format and an XML schema. The data interchange formats in this document are generic, in that they may be applied and used in a wide range of application areas. No application-specific requirements are addressed here.
    Provisions for the cryptographic protection of the authenticity, integrity, and confidentiality of stored and transmitted presentation attack detection data are beyond the scope of this document.
    NOTE       While addressing security is out of the scope of this document, PAD data may be protected by encoding them into a biometric information record (see ISO/IEC 19785-1) that includes an optional security block.
