abstract:
- content: The general method is applicable to phosphoric acid not containing polyphosphoric
    acids and to products having a calcium content equal to or greater than 0.020
    % (m/m). In special cases a preliminary hydrolysis of polyphosphoric acids is
    carried out by prolonged boiling in the presence of hydrochloric acid. Precipitation
    of calcium as calcium oxalate at pH 4 0.3, filtration of the precipitate, dissolution
    in hydrochloric acid and re-precipitation under the same operating conditions
    in order to purify the precipitate. Oxidimetric titration in sulphuric acid solution
    by means of potassium permanganate. - Cancels and replaces ISO Recommendation
    R 848-1968.
