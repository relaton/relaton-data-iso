  script: Latn
  content: Covers a method permitting measurement of temperature differences of 0,5
    °C. Should not be considered as an analytical method, but as a test for identification
    and indication of the purity of a product. Is based on evaporation by boiling
    of a known volume of the product under test and measurement of the temperatures
    corresponding to the evaporation of 5 and 95 % of the initial volume of the liquid.
