  content: "This document is intended to be applied to safety-related systems that
    include one or more electrical and/or electronic (E/E) systems and that are installed
    in series production road vehicles, excluding mopeds. This document does not address
    unique E/E systems in special vehicles such as E/E systems designed for drivers
    with disabilities. \nNOTE       Other dedicated application-specific safety standards
    exist and can complement the ISO 26262 series of standards or vice versa.\nSystems
    and their components released for production, or systems and their components
    already under development prior to the publication date of this document, are
    exempted from the scope of this edition. This document addresses alterations to
    existing systems and their components released for production prior to the publication
    of this document by tailoring the safety lifecycle depending on the alteration.
    This document addresses integration of existing systems not developed according
    to this document and systems developed according to this document by tailoring
    the safety lifecycle.\nThis document addresses possible hazards caused by malfunctioning
    behaviour of safety-related E/E systems, including interaction of these systems.
    It does not address hazards related to electric shock, fire, smoke, heat, radiation,
    toxicity, flammability, reactivity, corrosion, release of energy and similar hazards,
    unless directly caused by malfunctioning behaviour of safety-related E/E systems.\nThis
    document describes a framework for functional safety to assist the development
    of safety-related E/E systems. This framework is intended to be used to integrate
    functional safety activities into a company-specific development framework. Some
    requirements have a clear technical focus to implement functional safety into
    a product; others address the development process and can therefore be seen as
    process requirements in order to demonstrate the capability of an organization
    with respect to functional safety.\nThis document does not address the nominal
    performance of E/E systems.\nThis document has an informative character only.
    It contains possible interpretations of other parts of ISO 26262 with respect
    to semiconductor development. The content is not exhaustive with regard to possible
    interpretations, i.e., other interpretations can also be possible in order to
    fulfil the requirements defined in other parts of ISO 26262."
