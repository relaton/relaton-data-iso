    This document specifies safety requirements and protective/risk reduction measures, and the means for their verification, for all types and sizes of mobile elevating work platforms (MEWPs) intended for moving a person(s) along with their necessary tools and materials at an elevated work location.
    This document also applies to MEWPs designed for applications requiring special access to specific work areas. These MEWPs can be either self-propelled or manually propelled and are used to elevate personnel to a level at which they can place, install, or retrieve objects or material on a routine basis. To facilitate operator access to the work area, the retraction of a portion of the MEWP's work platform guardrail system(s) can be necessary.
    This document is intended to serve as a guide for manufacturers and remanufacturers of MEWPs to achieve the following objectives:
    —     elimination or reduction of accidents and personal injuries;
    —     establishment of criteria for design, manufacture, remanufacture, rebuild/recondition, testing and performance;
    —     establishment and understanding by manufacturers and remanufacturers of their responsibilities.
    The design and manufacturing requirements of this document apply to all MEWPs manufactured or remanufactured on or after the effective date, but it is not applicable to rebuilt or reconditioned MEWPs.
    It identifies the hazards arising from the use of MEWPs and describes methods for the elimination or reduction of these hazards.
    This document is not applicable to
    a)       permanently installed personnel-lifting appliances serving defined levels,
    b)       firefighting and fire rescue appliances (see for example, EN 1777),
    c)        unguided work cages suspended from lifting appliances (see for example, EN 1808),
    d)       elevating operator position on rail-dependent storage and retrieval equipment (see for example, EN 528),
    e)       tail lifts (see for example, EN 1756-1:2001+A1:2008, EN 1756-2:2004+A1:2009),
    f)         mast-climbing work platforms (see ISO 16369),
    g)       fairground equipment,
    h)       lifting tables with a lifting height of less than 2 m (see for example, EN 1570-1:2011+A1:2014),
    i)         builder's hoists for persons and materials,
    j)         aircraft ground-support equipment (see for example, EN-1915-1:2013, EN-1915-2:2001+A1:2009),
    k)       digger derricks,
    l)         elevating operator positions on industrial trucks (see for example, ISO 3691-3),
    m)     elevating operator positions on cranes,
    n)       certain requirements for insulating aerial devices on a chassis for use in live work on electrical installations (see Note 1),
    o)       multi-purpose elevating platform powered industrial trucks (MPEPs) controlled by a single stand-up riding operator and intended to be used for manually picking and transporting small items at height,
    p)       powered industrial trucks used to pick and place stock or inventory.
    NOTE 1        For requirements for use near live electrical installations, see ISO 16653-2. For requirements for use on live electrical installations, see IEC 61057.
    It does not cover hazards arising from:
    —     use in potentially explosive atmospheres,
    —     use of compressed gases for load-bearing components,
    —     derailment and runaway of rail-mounted MEWPs,
    —     work on live electrical systems (see Note 2 and Note 3).
    NOTE 2        Hazards arising from work on live electrical systems are addressed in IEC 61057.
    NOTE 3        For MEWPs that employ aerial devices used for live working, this document is to be used in conjunction with IEC 61057, taking into consideration the potential exceptions from this document that are specified in IEC 61057.
