abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 13170:2010 specifies the mechanical, physical and optical characteristics
    of a 120 mm and an 80 mm dual layer DVD re-recordable disk to enable the interchange
    of such disks. It specifies the quality of the embossed, unrecorded and the recorded
    signals, the format of the data, the format of the information zone, the format
    of the unrecorded zone, and the recording method, thereby allowing for information
    interchange by means of such disks. This disk is identified as a DVD re-recordable
    disk for dual layer (DVD-RW for DL). \nISO/IEC 13170:2010 specifies:\n- 120 mm
    and 80 mm nominal diameter disks that may be either single or double sided;\n-
    the conditions for conformance;\n- the environments in which the disk is to be
    operated and stored;\n- the mechanical and physical characteristics of the disk,
    so as to provide mechanical interchange between data processing systems;\n- the
    format of the embossed information on an unrecorded disk, including the physical
    disposition of the tracks and sectors, the error correcting codes and the coding
    method used;\n- the format of the data and the recorded information on the disk,
    including the physical disposition of the tracks and sectors, the error correcting
    codes and the coding method used;\n- the characteristics of the signals from embossed
    and unrecorded areas on the disk, enabling data processing systems to read the
    embossed information and to write to the disks;\n- the characteristics of the
    signals recorded on the disk, enabling data processing systems to read the data
    from the disk.\nISO/IEC 13170:2010 provides for interchange of disks between disk
    drives. Together with an International Standard for volume and file structure,
    it provides for full data interchange between data processing systems. "
