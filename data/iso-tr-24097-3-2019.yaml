    This document aims to promote ITS web services interoperability. Historically, web services interoperability evolved through activities shown in Figure 2. Applying the first two steps properly is the key to interoperability.
    This document focuses on the following topics:
    —          WS-policy language;
    —          domain specific policy metadata:
    - —   WS-Aaddressing policy metadata;
    - —   WS-ReliableMessaging policy metadata;
    - —   WS-Security Policy metadata;
    - —   SOAP Message transmission optimization Policy;
    - —   other policies.
