    This document specifies an open-loop test procedure to examine the effect of braking on course holding and directional behaviour of a vehicle. Specifically, the method determines how the steady-state circular response of a vehicle is altered by a braking action only. This document is applicable to passenger cars as defined in ISO 3833 and to light trucks.
    The open-loop manoeuvre specified in this test method is not representative of real driving conditions but is useful to obtain measures of vehicle braking behaviour resulting from control inputs under closely controlled test conditions.
