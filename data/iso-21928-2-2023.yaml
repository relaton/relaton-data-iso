abstract:
- content: |-
    This document establishes a set of common aspects and impacts for all typologies of civil engineering works, and identifies core sets of environmental, social and economic aspects and impacts for each typology of civil engineering works defined.
    The common core set of aspects and impacts described in this document are applicable to all types of civil engineering works. In addition, this document describes specific core sets of aspects and impacts for different typologies of civil engineering works (industrial process infrastructures; linear infrastructures; dams and other fluvial works; maritime works; public spaces; and other civil engineering works not contained in the previous typologies).
    Further, the document gives rules for establishing a system of indicators and describes how to use sustainability indicators regarding civil engineering works.
    This document does not provide guidelines for the weighting of indicators or the aggregation of assessment results.
