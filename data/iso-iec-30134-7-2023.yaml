abstract:
- content: |-
    This document specifies the cooling efficiency ratio (CER) as a key performance indicator (KPI) for quantifying the efficient use of energy to control the temperature of spaces within a data centre (DC).
    This document:
    a)    defines the CER of a DC;
    b)    describes the relationship of this KPI to a DC’s infrastructure, information technology equipment and information technology operations;
    c)    defines the measurement, the calculation and the reporting of the parameter; and
    d)    provides information on the correct interpretation of the CER.
    Annex A describes the correlation of the CER and other KPIs.
    Annex B provides examples of the usage of the CER.
    Annex C introduces the parameters that affect the CER.
    Annex D describes requirements and recommendations for derivatives of KPIs associated with the CER.
    This document is not applicable to cooling systems that are not powered by electricity (e.g. heat-driven absorption chillers).
