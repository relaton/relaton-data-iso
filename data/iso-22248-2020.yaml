    This document specifies a method of testing the laser-induced ignition and damage of medical beam delivery systems to allow checking of suitable products according to the classification system.
    NOTE 1 Take care when interpreting these results, since the direct applicability of the results of this test method to the clinical situation has not been fully established.
    NOTE 2 Users of products tested by this method are cautioned that the laser will be wavelength sensitive and tested at the wavelength for which it is intended to be used. If tested using other wavelengths, the power settings and modes of beam delivery need to be explicitly stated.
    CAUTION — This test method can involve hazardous materials, operations and equipment. This document provides advice on minimizing some of the risks associated with its use but does not purport to address all such risks. It is the responsibility of the user of this document to establish appropriate safety and health practices and to determine the applicability of regulatory limitations prior to use.
