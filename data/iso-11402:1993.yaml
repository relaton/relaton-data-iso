  content: Specifies test methods (hydroxylammonium chloride, sulfite or KCN procedure)
    for condensation resins, including urea, furan, melamine and phenolic resins,
    as well as combinations and modifications of these resins. The free formaldehyde
    determined according to this standard establishes the actual condition at the
    time of test, the value has no quantitative relationship to free formaldehyde
    that may arise during or after processing. The purpose is to establish recognized
    determination procedures (e.g. in order to check whether official regulations
    on the handling of hazardous workplace materials are observed).
