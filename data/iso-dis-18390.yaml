abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: This document describes a simplified routine method applicable to the dynamic
    or static sampling, by manual or mechanical means, of cereals, pulses and cereal
    products for assessment of their quality and condition. It is applicable to sampling
    for the determination of heterogeneously distributed contaminants, undesirable
    substances and parameters usually homogenously distributed, such as those used
    to assess quality or compliance with a specification. It is suitable for daily
    use in the field, in silos and factories that ship or received grains. It can
    be used to determine insect infestation in a grain lot, although it is recommended
    to assess harmful insect populations by trapping whilst grain is in storage. Methods
    for assessing insect populations are provided in the standard ISO 16002. This
    document is not applicable to seeds.
