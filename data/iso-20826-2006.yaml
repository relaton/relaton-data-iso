  content: "ISO 20826:2006 specifies the technical requirements for the design and
    the testing of automotive Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) containers, to be permanently
    attached to a motor vehicle which uses automotive LPG as a fuel. \nThe technical
    requirements cover the design criteria, the requirements on construction and workmanship,
    the marking and re-qualification procedures.\nISO 20826:2006 also covers all tests,
    including their frequencies, to be carried out on autogas containers, during production
    and performance verification. Specific recommendations are also given on the tests
    to be carried out when changing the design."
