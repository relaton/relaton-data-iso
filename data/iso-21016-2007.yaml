    ISO 21016:2007 specifies test methods for the determination of the stability, the strength and the durability of all types of office tables designed for use in the seated and/or standing position, e.g. work tables, height-adjustable tables, meeting tables and desks. It applies to tables that are fully assembled and ready for use.
    ISO 21016:2007 does not contain test methods for storage elements, which can be found in ISO 7170.
    The tests consist of the application, to various parts of the unit, of loads, forces and velocities simulating normal functional use, as well as misuse, that can reasonably be expected to occur.
    With the exception of the deflection of table tops, the tests are designed to evaluate properties without regard to materials, design/construction or manufacturing processes.
    The test results are valid only for the unit/component tested. These results can be used to represent the performance of production models provided that the tested model is representative of the production model.
    Tests carried out according to ISO 21016:2007 are intended to demonstrate the ability of the item to give satisfactory service in its intended environment. It is necessary to understand that such tests do not ensure that structural failure will not eventually occur as a result of habitual misuse or after an excessively long period of service. The tests have been developed for units/components that have not been in use. However, when properly justified, they can be used for fault investigation.
    ISO 21016:2007 specifies test methods only.
    ISO 21016:2007 does not specify requirements. These should be specified in a requirements document. If this is not available, suggested forces and cycles are included in ISO 21016:2007.
    ISO 21016:2007 does not include an assessment of ageing or degradation.
