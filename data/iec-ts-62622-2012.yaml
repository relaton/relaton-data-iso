  script: Latn
  content: IEC/TS 62622:2012(E), which is a technical specification, specifies the
    generic terminology for the global and local quality parameters of artificial
    gratings, interpreted in terms of deviations from nominal positions of grating
    features, and provides guidance on the categorization of measurement and evaluation
    methods for their determination. This specification is intended to facilitate
    communication among manufacturers, users and calibration laboratories dealing
    with the characterization of the dimensional quality parameters of artificial
    gratings used in nanotechnology. This specification supports quality assurance
    in the production and use of artificial gratings in different areas of application
    in nanotechnology. Whilst the definitions and described methods are universal
    to a large variety of different gratings, the focus is on one-dimensional (1D)
    and two-dimensional (2D) gratings.
