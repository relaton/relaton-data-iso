  content: ISO/TR 22869:2005 provides guidance to medical laboratories describing
    how a medical laboratory can implement a quality system to meet the specific technical
    and management requirements for quality and competence in ISO 15189:2003. Bodies
    engaged in the recognition of the competence of medical laboratories may also
    be able to use ISO/TR 22869:2005 as a basis to assist laboratories in establishing
    a quality system to meet national requirements, while at the same time conforming
    to appropriate International Standards. This guidance applies both to newly established
    and existing laboratories and encompasses both the management and technical requirements
    of ISO 15189:2003.
