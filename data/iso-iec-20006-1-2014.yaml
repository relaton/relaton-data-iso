- content: |-
    ISO/IEC 20006-1:2014 provides:
    - a general framework for dealing with competency information in information technology for learning, education, and training (ITLET) contexts;
    - a system architecture for managing and exchanging competency information and its related objects;
    - an information model for expressing competency and its related objects that includes an introduction to the composition of competency;
    - use cases used to support the development of the general framework and competency information model.
    ISO/IEC 20006-1:2014 is for those who design and use learning systems and human resources systems to support management and exchange of competency information using ITLET systems.
    ISO/IEC 20006-1:2014 is related to the Conceptual Reference Model developed in ISO/IEC TR 24763. Information regarding the relationships between the ISO/IEC 20006 and ISO/IEC TR 24763 is provided.
