abstract:
- content: "This International Standard specifies the minimum operational and performance
    requirements, methods of testing and required test results conforming to performance
    standards adopted by the IMO in resolution MSC.74(69) Annex 2 Recommendations
    on Performance Standards for Track Control Systems. In addition it takes into
    account IMO resolution A.694 to which IEC 60945 is associated. When a requirement
    of this standard is different from IEC 60945, the requirement in this standard
    shall take precedence. \nNOTE All text of this standard that is identical to that
    in IMO resolution MSC.74(69), Annex 2, is printed in italics and the resolution
    (abbreviated to ? A2) and paragraph numbers are indicated in brackets i.e. (A2/3.3)"
