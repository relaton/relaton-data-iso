    ISO 28278-1:2011 specifies requirements for the suitability of supported and unsupported glass products for use in the structural sealant glazing (SSG) technique. Regarding glass products, ISO 28278-1:2011 constitutes a supplement to the requirements specified in the corresponding international standards with regard to verifying suitability for use in SSG systems.
    Only soda lime silicate glass is taken into consideration in ISO 28278-1:2011.
    The glass products are installed and bonded into the support under controlled environmental conditions as described in ISO 28278-2.
    Plastic glazing is excluded from the scope of ISO 28278-1:2011.
    The structural weatherproofing and sealant and outer seal of IGU products, which are commonly used in structural glazing applications are those based on organo-siloxane,"silicone" polymers, and recommended for use by the sealant manufacturer. Where there is a risk of earthquakes, the sealant design may not be sufficient to resist the loads, and complementary arrangements may be necessary.
    ISO 28278-1:2011 does not preclude the use of other sealant types where these can demonstrate suitability for service according to ISO 28278-1:2011 and when used following the recommendations of the sealant manufacturer.
