abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 22050:2002 specifies the physical and magnetic characteristics
    of magnetic tape cartridges, using magnetic tape 12,65 mm wide so as to provide
    physical interchange of such cartridges between drives. It also specifies the
    quality of the recorded signals, the recording method and the recorded format,
    thereby allowing data interchange between drives by means of such cartridges.
    \nThe linearly recorded format, called Ultrium-1, has 384 tracks. It uses a timing
    based servo for improved track following. The format supports variable length
    Logical Records, high speed search, and the use of a registered algorithm for
    data compression.\nISO/IEC 22050:2002 specifies four types of cartridges depending
    on the length of tape contained in the case. These four types are referred to
    as Type A, Type B, Type C and Type D; their nominal uncompressed capacity is 100
    Gbytes, 50 Gbytes, 30 Gbytes and 10 Gbytes, respectively.\nTogether with a standard
    for volume and file structure this document provides for full data interchange
    between data processing systems."
