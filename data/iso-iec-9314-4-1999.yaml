abstract:
- content: This part of ISO/IEC 9314 specifies the Single-mode fibre Physical Layer
    Medium Dependent (SMF-PMD) requirements for the Fibre Distributed Data Interface
    (FDDI).FDDI provides a high bandwidth (100 megabits per second) general purpose
    interconnection among computers and peripheral equipment using a fibre optic waveguide
    as the transmission medium. The FDDI may be configured to support a sustained
    transfer rate of approximately80 megabits (10 megabytes) per second. The FDDI
    may not meet the response time requirements of all unbuffered high speed devices.
    The FDDI establishes the connection among many stations distributed over distances
    of several kilometers in extent. Default values for FDDI were calculated on the
    basis of 1000 physical connections and a total fibre path length of 200 kilometers
    (see the MAC Standard – ISO/IEC 9314-2 or ISO/IEC 9314-8).The FDDI consists of:1)
    The Physical Layer Medium Dependent (PMD) is specified in four alternative standards:a)
    ISO/IEC 9314-3 (FDDI PMD) corresponding to multimode fibre (MMF) which actuallymeans
    "FDDI MMF-PMD".b) This standard ISO/IEC 9314-4 (SMF-PMD) which contains the requirements
    for singlemodefibre (SMF) physical connections between stations.c) ISO/IEC 9314-9
    (FDDI LCF-PMD), an alternative lower cost multimode fibre (LCF) forshorter distances.d)
    ISO/IEC 9314-10 (FDDI TP-PMD), a copper twisted pair (TP) alternative.An FDDI
    ring can be made up of all these alternatives. (For some restrictions see 6.4).The
    PMD provides all services necessary to transport a suitably coded digital bit
    streamfrom station to station. The SMF-PMD specifies the point of interconnectionrequirements
    for FDDI stations and cable plants at both sides of the Media InterfaceConnector
    (MIC) for conforming stations utilizing single-mode fibre.SMF-PMD includes the
    following:i) The optical power budgets for two (2) categories of Active Output
    and Active InputInterfaces using single-mode fibre optic cables and optical bypass
    switchesii) The MIC Receptacle mechanical mating requirements including the keying
    featuresiii) The single-mode fibre optic cable requirementsiv) The services provided
    by PMD to PHY and SMT2) A Physical Layer Protocol (PHY), which provides connection
    between multimode or singlemodePMD and the Data Link Layer (DLL). PHY establishes
    clock synchronization with theupstream code-bit data stream and decodes this incoming
    code-bit stream into anequivalent symbol stream for use by the higher layers.
    PHY provides encoding anddecoding between data and control indicator symbols and
    code-bits, medium conditioningand initializing, the synchronization of incoming
    and outgoing code-bit clocks, and thedelineation of octet boundaries as required
    for the transmission of information to or fromhigher layers. Information to be
    transmitted on the interface medium is encoded by the PHYinto a grouped transmission
    code.3) A Data Link Layer (DLL), which controls the accessing of the medium and
    the generationand verification of frame check sequences to assure the proper delivery
    of valid data to the– 8 – 9314-4 © ISO/IEC:1999(E)higher layers. DLL also concerns
    itself with the generation and recognition of deviceaddresses and the peer-to-peer
    associations within the FDDI network. For purpose of thePHY, references to DLL
    are made in terms of the Media Access Control (MAC) entity, whichis the lowest
    sublayer of DLL.4) A Station Management (SMT), which provides the control necessary
    at the station level to manage the processes underway in the various FDDI layers
    such that a station may work cooperatively on a ring. SMT provides services such
    as control of configuration management, fault isolation and recovery, and scheduling
    procedures.This part of ISO/IEC 9314 is a supporting document to ISO/IEC 9314-1
    which should be read inconjunction with it.The SMT document ISO/IEC 9314-6 should
    be consulted for information pertaining tosupported FDDI station and network configurations.The
    set of FDDI standards specifies the interfaces, functions and operations necessary
    toinsure interoperability between conforming FDDI implementations. This part of
    ISO/IEC 9314 isa functional description. Conforming implementations may employ
    any design technique whichdoes not violate interoperability.
