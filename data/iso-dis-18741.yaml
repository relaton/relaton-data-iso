abstract:
- content: "This document specifies minimum requirements for high manganese austenitic
    steel forgings for valves, flanges, fittings and other pressure-containing components
    for cryogenic temperature. \nThe specification of high manganese austenitic steel
    forgings can be applicable to all pressure retaining components and any non-pressure
    retaining component.\nThe selection of high manganese austenitic steel forgings
    for a specific service including any necessary additional material requirements
    remains the responsibility of the end user."
