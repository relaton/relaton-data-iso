    ISO 15540:2016 specifies a test procedure for determining the fire resistance of non-metallic hose assemblies and non-metallic compensators with nominal diameter of up to 150 mm. It may be used for larger sizes provided proper test bench conditions are obtained.
    It serves for proving whether, after the period of fire effect on the test bench specified in ISO 15541, hose assemblies and non-metallic compensators continue to be tight, even when subjected to proof pressure.
    Only water is permitted as a test medium. With a view to ensuring maximum safety for both the operating personnel and the test bench in the event of damage to the hose or non-metallic compensator during the test, the use of combustible test media is excluded.
