    This document specifies a procedure for determining the lowest temperature at which rubber- or plastics-coated fabrics will not exhibit fractures or coating cracks when subjected to specific impact conditions.
    Rubber-or plastics-coated fabrics are used in many applications involving low-temperature flexing with or without impact. Data obtained by this method can be used to predict the behaviour of these coated fabrics at low temperatures only in the applications in which the conditions of deformation are similar to those specified in the method.
