    This part of ISO/IEC 10192 is one of a set of standards describing the characteristics of a
    specific home control system called the Home Electronic System, HES.
    This standard specifies the characteristics of the Universal Interface Class 1 that connects
    devices to the home network in an HES for control applications.
    This standard informs as to the usefulness of the principles of a UI and forms a basis for new
    work in this field.
    NOTE This standard draws upon text from IEC 60870-5-1:1990 and IEC 60870-5-2:1992.
    1.2 Application
    This standard specifies a generic interface for a device to connect to a home control network
    via a Network Adaptor Unit. The home control network signals may be carried on the cabling
    system being specified in ISO/IEC 150181.
