  content: ISO 10333-6:2004 specifies tests and requirements for complete personal
    fall arrest systems (PFAS) made up from specific combinations of components and
    subsystems selected from those conforming to the other parts of ISO 10333 and
    to ISO 14567, where it is both important and desirable to ascertain satisfactory
    system performance and interactive component compatibility. It includes PFAS performance
    tests using a rigid torso test mass as a surrogate for the faller. Examples of
    personal fall arrest systems, as well as descriptions of how components or subsystems
    may be connected together to constitute a system, are also given.
