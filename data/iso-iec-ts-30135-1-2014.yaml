  content: The EPUB® specification is a distribution and interchange format standard
    for digital publications and documents. EPUB defines a means of representing,
    packaging and encoding structured and semantically enhanced Web content — including
    HTML5, CSS, SVG, images, and other resources — for distribution in a single-file
    format.EPUB 3, the third major release of the standard, consists of a set of four
    specifications, each defining an important component of an overall EPUB Publication:-EPUB
    Publications 3.0 [Publications30], which defines publication-level semantics and
    overarching conformance requirements for EPUB Publications.-EPUB Content Documents
    3.0 [ContentDocs30], which defines profiles of XHTML, SVG and CSS for use in the
    context of EPUB Publications.-EPUB Open Container Format (OCF) 3.0 [OCF3], which
    defines a file format and processing model for encapsulating a set of related
    resources into a single-file (ZIP) EPUB Container.-EPUB Media Overlays 3.0 [MediaOverlays30],
    which defines a format and a processing model for synchronization of text and
    audio.EPUB has been widely adopted as the format for digital books (eBooks), and
    these new specifications significantly increase the format's capabilities in order
    to better support a wider range of publication requirements, including complex
    layouts, rich media and interactivity, and global typography features. The expectation
    is that EPUB 3 will be utilized for a broad range of content, including books,
    magazinesand educational, professional and scientific publications.This document
    provides a starting point for content authors and software developers wishing
    tounderstand these specifications. It consists of non-normative overview material,
    including a roadmap tothe four building-block specification documents that compose
    EPUB 3.Another non-normative document, EPUB 3 Changes from EPUB 2.0.1 [EPUB3Changes],
    describeschanges in EPUB 3 from the previous version, but is intended primarily
    for Authors and EPUB ReadingSystem vendors migrating from EPUB 2.0.1 to EPUB 3
    and for those who anticipate supporting both versions.
