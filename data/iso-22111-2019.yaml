    This document provides the requirements for structural design and procedures following a semi-probabilistic approach that conform to the general principles for structural reliability as stipulated by ISO 2394. The scope of requirements and procedures are accordingly limited to the design of structures for which sufficient knowledge and experience are commonly available on design and construction practice to ensure that target levels of reliability account for the nature and consequences of structural failure. Situations outside these limitations are covered by ISO 2394.
    The methods that are included in this document are the semi-probabilistic limit states approaches that are proven to achieve sufficient and consistent levels of structural reliability.
    This document relies on standardized procedures for the characterization of the load bearing performance of the structures within its scope. Sufficient information is needed on uncertainties of design variables and models to be able to derive semi-probabilistic design measures for verification of structural reliability within the scope of this and the related design standards.
