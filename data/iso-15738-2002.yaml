  content: This International Standard specifies performance and testing requirements
    for the gas inflation systems for inflatable life-saving appliances complying
    with the requirements of the 1974 Safety of Life at Sea Convention (SOLAS 74),
    as amended, and IMO Resolution MSC.48(66). For the purposes of this International
    Standard, the gas inflation system consists of inflation gas, cylinder valve,
    cylinder operating head, high-pressure hoses, and pressure-relief, inflate/deflate,
    non-return, and transfer valves. This International Standard addresses only systems
    in which compressed inflation gas in cylinders is used as the inflation medium.
    Because national requirements for qualification, use, and testing of gas cylinders
    vary widely, requirements for gas cylinders are not addressed in this International
    Standard, but should meet the requirements of the applicable regulatory bodies.
    The systems addressed in this International Standard are of the type generally
    used in primary life-saving appliances such as survival craft, marine evacuation
    systems, and means of rescue; systems used in personal life-saving appliances,
    such as inflatable lifejackets, are addressed elsewhere.
