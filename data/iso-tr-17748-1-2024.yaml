    This document provides a framework and information on the total amount of energy appropriate for the deployment of smart city mobility and energy efficiency technologies. These technologies can increase operational energy efficiency and unlock enhanced transportation waste-free energy applications, as well as measuring energy consumption.
    The standard framework for energy-based green intelligent transport systems (G-ITS) builds on the best practices for energy efficient transport and management systems, as well as applications of intelligent transport systems (ITS), and aims to accommodate the specific needs of energy-based green ITS in smart cities.
    G-ITS use data platforms to measure energy for transport and to forecast demand. A smart city provides G-ITS services to improve energy efficiency by using nomadic devices and by monitoring energy supply and demand.
    This document describes the change in the traffic paradigm from the perspective of energy efficiency. It outlines:
    —     general information for energy-based G-ITS as a service using nomadic and mobile devices;
    —     use cases for energy-based G-ITS services using nomadic and mobile devices;
    —     use cases for energy-based mobility services, for example electric vehicles (EV), transportation infrastructure and other mobility services using nomadic devices.
