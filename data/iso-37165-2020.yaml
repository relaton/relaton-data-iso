    This document provides guidance on how to organize and implement smart transportation by digitally processed payment (d-payment) in order to provide a safe, convenient payment method for citizens and city visitors in transportation and its related or additional services. This will additionally benefit operators managing fee receipt in transportation services and money transfer or transactions between these business operators and banks or settlement organizations.
    Smart transportation by d-payment is not intended to eliminate cash payment from transportation services but is helpful in organizing inter-operator, city, regional and national common ticket networks and providing trading services independent of local currencies.
