    ISO/TS 19706:2004 is to serve as general guidelines for assessment of the fire threat to people. ISO/TS 19706:2004 encompasses the development, evaluation and use of relevant quantitative information for fire hazard and risk assessment. This information, generally obtained from fire incidence investigation, fire statistics, real-scale fire tests and from physical fire models, is to be used in conjunction with computational models for analysis of the initiation and development of fire, fire spread, smoke formation and movement, chemical species generation, transport and decay and people movement, as well as fire detection and suppression (ISO/TR 13387). Aspects of the methodology described in ISO/TS 19706:2004 are further amplified in ISO/TS 13571 and ISO 13344.
    ISO/TS 19706:2004 is intended to facilitate addressing the consequences of a single acute human exposure to fire effluent. Other effects of the heat, gases and aerosols (such as effects on electronic equipment and effects of frequent, multiple environmental exposures of people), which are of importance in fire safety design, will be addressed elsewhere.
