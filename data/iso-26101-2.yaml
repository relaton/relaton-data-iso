    This document specifies methods for qualifying an environment that approximates to an acoustic free field near one or more reflecting planes. The goal of the qualification is to determine the environmental correction K2, which is used to correct for reflected sound when determining the sound power level or sound energy level of a noise source from sound pressure levels measured on a surface enveloping the noise source (machinery or equipment) in such an environment. In addition, the environmental correction K2  is used as an input parameter for the determination of the local environmental correction K3 which is used to determine the emission sound pressure level in an environment that approximates to an acoustic free field near one or more reflecting planes.
    In practice, the K2  value determined will be a function of both the reflected sound from the test environment and the shape and size of the measurement surface used for the K2 determination. For the purposes of this standard and the standards that refer to it, the differences between K2  values determined with different measurement surfaces are assumed to be included in the stated measurement uncertainty for the test method.
