abstract:
- content: As measurements of the degree of wall thickening of the fibres is too laborious
    for most practical purposes, this method of determination of maturity of cotton
    fibres is an indirect test. It consists of an appraisal, based on judgment and
    experience, and is suitable for routine research purposes.
