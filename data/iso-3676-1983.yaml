abstract:
- content: This is based on the concept of a modular system and specifies the plan
    dimensions for unit loads suitable for distrbution of goods, which comprises all
    activities for the movement of products from their origin to their destination.
    The plan dimension of the preferred modular unit load shall be 1200 mm x 1000
    mm. This unit load is derived from the basic 600 mm x 400 mm module, and as such
    is an element of the modular distribution system.
