    This part of ISO 7617 specifies technical requirements for coated fabrics for upholstered furniture for interior use,
    obtained by applying to one side of a weft-knitted base cloth a substantially continuous coating of a suitably
    plasticized polymer of vinyl chloride, or a copolymer the major constituent of which is vinyl chloride. Such coatings
    are known as poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) coatings. The present specification covers fabrics coated with solid PVC
    and also covers two grades with coatings consisting of a layer of expanded PVC.
