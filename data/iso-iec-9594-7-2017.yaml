abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 9594-7:2017 defines a number of object classes and name forms
    which may be found useful across a range of applications of the Directory. The
    definition of an object class involves listing a number of attribute types which
    are relevant to objects of that class. The definition of a name form involves
    naming the object class to which it applies and listing the attributes to be used
    in forming names for objects of that class. These definitions are used by the
    administrative authority which is responsible for the management of the directory
    information. \nAny administrative authority can define its own object classes
    or subclasses and name forms for any purpose.\nNOTE 1 - Those definitions may
    or may not use the notation specified in Rec. ITU-T X.501 | ISO/IEC 9594-2. \nNOTE
    2 - It is recommended that an object class defined in this Recommendation | International
    Standard, or a subclass derived from one, or a name form defined in this Recommendation
    | International Standard, be used in preference to the generation of a new one,
    whenever the semantics is appropriate for the application.\nAdministrative authorities
    may support some or all the selected object classes and name forms, and may also
    add additional ones. \nAll administrative authorities shall support the object
    classes which the directory uses for its own purpose (the top, alias and Directory
    system agent (DSA) object classes)."
