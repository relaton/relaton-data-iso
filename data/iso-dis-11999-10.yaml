  content: "This document specifies minimum design and performance requirements for
    personal protective equipment (PPE) to be used by firefighters whilst engaged
    in fighting fires occurring in structures, primarily but not solely to protect
    against exposure to flame and high thermal loads. The scope of this document does
    not include PPE for use in high risk fire exposures where, for example, protective
    clothing with reflective surface according to ISO 15538 might be more appropriate,
    where exposure to lower levels of heat or flame may be encountered by firefighters
    engaged in support activities where PPE according to ISO 11613 might be more appropriate,
    or for use in long term firefighting operations in high ambient temperature (for
    example, bush, wildland, or forest firefighting) where PPE according to ISO 16073
    might be more appropriate. Similarly, this document does not include PPE to protect
    against chemical and biological hazards, other than against short term and accidental
    exposure while engaged in firefighting and associated activities when fighting
    fires occurring in structures. \n\nThis part of ISO 11999 supports the structure
    identified in ISO 11999-1 for a harmonised approach across all parts of this series
    by setting single minimum design and performance requirements for PPE, including
    optional requirements where identified, and for product markings and manufacturer’s
    instructions. Selection of an appropriate system of protective clothing is dependent
    upon an effective risk assessment which identifies the hazards to be faced, evaluates
    the likelihood of those hazards, and provides the means to reduce or eliminate
    these hazards (see ISO 21808)."
