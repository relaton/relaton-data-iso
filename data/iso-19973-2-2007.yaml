    ISO 19973-2:2007 provides test procedures for determining the reliability of pneumatic directional control valves by testing and the methods of reporting the results of testing according to the general test conditions and the calculation method provided in ISO 19973-1.
    The lifetime of pneumatic and electro-pneumatic directional control valves is usually given as a number of cycles. Therefore, whenever the term "time" is used in ISO 19973-2:2007, this variable is understood as cycles.
    ISO 19973-2:2007 also specifies test equipment and threshold levels for tests to determine the reliability of pneumatic directional control valves.
