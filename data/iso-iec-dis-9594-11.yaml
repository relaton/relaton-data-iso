    The scope of this Recommendation | International Standard is threefold.
    This Recommendation | International Standard provides guidance on how to prepare new and old protocols for cryptographic algorithm migration, and defines auxiliary cryptographic algorithms to be used for migration purposes.
    This Recommendation | International Standard specifies a general wrapper protocol that provides authentication, integrity and confidentiality (encryption) protection for other protocols. This wrapper protocol includes a migration path for cryptographic algorithms allowing for smooth migration to stronger cryptographic algorithms as such requirements evolve. This will allow migration to quantum-safe cryptographic algorithms. Protected protocols can then be developed without taking security and cryptographic algorithms into consideration.
    This Recommendation | International Standard also includes some protocols to be protected by the wrapper protocol primarily for support of public-key infrastructure (PKI). Other specifications, e.g., Recommendations or International Standards, may also develop protocols designed to be protected by the wrapper protocol.
