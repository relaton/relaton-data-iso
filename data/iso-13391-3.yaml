abstract:
- content: "This document provides a methodology for determining the greenhouse gas
    emissions from alternative products (or a representative mix of alternative products).
    It also provides a methodology for calculating the displacement potential for
    wood and wood-based products.\nNOTE            \"Emissions from alternative products\"
    is a term defined in ISO 13391-1. \nThis document also deals with situations that
    do not lead to displacement.\nThis document is intended to be used by organizations
    seeking to understand, commit to or contribute to climate change mitigation. These
    organizations can be either private or public, regardless of type or size, and
    located in any jurisdiction or any position within a specific value chain."
