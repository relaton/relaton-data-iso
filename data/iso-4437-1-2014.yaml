abstract:
- content: |-
    ISO 4437-1:2014 specifies the general properties of polyethylene (PE) compounds for the manufacture of pipes and fittings intended to be used for the supply of gaseous fuels.
    It also specifies the test parameters for the test methods referred to in this International Standard.
    In conjunction with ISO 4437-2, ISO 4437-3, ISO 4437-4, and ISO 4437-5, it is applicable to PE pipes, fittings and valves, their joints, and joints with components of PE and other materials intended to be used under the following conditions: the maximum operating pressure (MOP) is based on the design stress determined from the compound minimum required strength (MRS) divided by the C factor, and taking into account rapid crack propagation (RCP) requirements; and a temperature of 20 °C is taken as reference temperature for the design basis.
