    ISO 10438-3:2003 specifies requirements for oil systems supplying lubricating oil to machines in general-purpose applications for use in the petroleum, petrochemical and natural gas industries. It is intended to be used in conjunction with ISO 10438-1. ISO 10438 in its entirety specifies requirements for lubrication systems, oil-type shaft-sealing systems, self-acting gas seal systems, control-oil systems and other auxiliaries for general- or special-purpose applications. These systems can serve equipment such as compressors, gears, pumps and drivers. General-purpose applications are limited to lubrication systems.
    None of the parts of ISO 10438 is applicable to internal combustion engines.
    Typical schemas for general-purpose oil systems are provided.
