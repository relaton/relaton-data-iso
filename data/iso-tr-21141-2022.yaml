    The purpose of this document is to extract the methods for determining the yield and ultimate characteristics and ductility of joints and assemblies from test data by reviewing existing standards in Europe, North America and Far East Asia and to provide the basic data for unifying the evaluation methods of parameters by clarifying their similarities and differences.
    These parameters are applied for determining the seismic performance of timber structures. This document deals with the method for determining the mechanical properties of individual joints and assemblies, and it does not refer to the seismic performance of the entire structure.
