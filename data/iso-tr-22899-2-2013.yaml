abstract:
- content: "The test specified in ISO 22899-1 is designed to give an indication of
    how passive fire protection materials will perform in a jet fire. \nISO/TR 22899-2:2013
    provides: background information on the applicability and validation of the jet
    fire test; further details on testing pipe penetration seals; guidance on the
    interpretation of the tests results and on an optional classification system;
    guidance on the combination of results from hydrocarbon furnace tests and resistance
    to jet fire tests.\nISO 22899-1 describes the thickness of fire protection material
    (sometimes referred to as passive fire protection; PFP) required to resist the
    application of a ?jet fire'. ISO/TR 22899-2:2013 provides information on the ?erosion
    factor' which is the additional thickness required above and beyond that required
    to satisfy the relevant criteria of ISO 834 (or other national or regional standards
    designed to evaluate the fire resistance with respect to a fully developed fire)
    for the element/construction under test."
