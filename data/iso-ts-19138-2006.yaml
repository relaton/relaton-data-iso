  content: "ISO/TS 19138:2006 defines a set of data quality measures. These can be
    used when reporting data quality for the data quality subelements identified in
    ISO 19113. Multiple measures are defined for each data quality subelement, and
    the choice of which to use will depend on the type of data and its intended purpose.\nThe
    data quality measures are structured so that they can be maintained in a register
    established in conformance with ISO 19135. \nISO/TS 19138:2006 does not attempt
    to describe every possible data quality measure, only a set of commonly used ones."
