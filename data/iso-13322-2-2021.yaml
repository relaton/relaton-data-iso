abstract:
- content: This document describes a method to transfer the images from particles
    having relative motion to binary images within practical systems, in which the
    particles in the images are individually separated. Images of moving particles
    are created by an optical image capture device. Effects of particle movement on
    the images are either minimized by the instrumentation or corrected by software
    procedures. This method is applicable to the particle images that are clearly
    distinguishable from static background. Further processing of the binary image,
    which is then considered as static, is described in ISO 13322-1. A dynamic image
    analysis system is capable of measuring a higher number of particles compared
    to static image analysis systems. This document provides guidance on instrument
    qualification for particle size distribution measurements by using particulate
    reference materials. This document addresses the relative movement of the particles
    with respect to each other, the effect of particle movement on the image (motion
    blur), the movement and position along the optical axis (depth of field), and
    the orientation of the particles with respect to the camera.
