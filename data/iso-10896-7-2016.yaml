    ISO 10896-7:2016 specifies design, safety and verification requirements for longitudinal load moment systems which can be used on rough-terrain trucks (hereafter referred to as trucks). This document provides requirements for both the longitudinal load moment indicator (hereafter referred to as LLMI) and the longitudinal load moment control (hereafter referred to as LLMC) used on rough-terrain trucks, defined in ISO 10896‑1, in a stationary position performing loading or placing functions on consolidated, stable and level ground.
    It is not applicable to the following:
    -      lorry-mounted trucks as defined in ISO 20297‑1;
    -      slewing variable-reach trucks as defined in ISO 10896‑2.
    ISO 10896-7:2016 deals with significant hazards, hazardous situations or hazardous events relevant to longitudinal load moment systems when used as intended and under conditions of misuse which are reasonably foreseeable by the manufacturer.
    ISO 10896-7:2016 does not cover the risk due to lateral instability or instability due to the travelling of the truck. The longitudinal load moment system is not intended for warning of the overturning risk while the truck is travelling.
    ISO 10896-7:2016 is not applicable to longitudinal load moment systems manufactured before the date of its publication.
