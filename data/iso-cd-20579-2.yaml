    This document identifies information to be reported by an analyst in a datasheet, certificate of analysis, report or other publication regarding the preparation and mounting of specimens for surface analysis. This information is needed to ensure reliability and reproducibility of analyses. Such information is in addition to other details associated with specimen synthesis, processing history and characterization, and should become part of the data record (sometimes identified as provenance information) regarding the source of the material and changes that have taken place since it was originated.

    This document also includes informative annexes that summarize important processes and common approaches relevant to sample preparation and mounting for surface analysis. These are intended as an aid for the analyst in understanding the specialized sample-handling conditions required for analyses by techniques such as Auger electron spectroscopy, secondary-ion mass spectrometry, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The protocols described may also be applicable for other analytical techniques, such as TXRF, that are sensitive to surface composition.

    This document does not define the nature of instrumentation or operating procedures needed to ensure that the analytical measurements described have been appropriately conducted.
