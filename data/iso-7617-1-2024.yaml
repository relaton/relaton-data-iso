    This document specifies requirements for coated fabrics for upholstered furniture for interior use, obtained by applying to one side of a weft-knitted base cloth a substantially continuous coating of a suitably plasticized polymer of vinyl chloride, or a copolymer the major constituent of which is vinyl chloride. Such coatings are known as poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) coatings.
    This document covers fabrics coated with solid PVC. It also covers two grades with coatings consisting of a layer of expanded PVC.
