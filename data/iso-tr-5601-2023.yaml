  content: This document aims to enable users to identify an appropriate method for
    the determination of volatile organic compounds (VOC) content and/or the semi-volatile
    organic compounds (SVOC) content of coating materials and their raw materials.
    This document provides a step-by-step procedure for identifying appropriate tests.
    This document is intended to be used in conjunction with ISO 11890-1, ISO 11890-2
    and ISO 17895, to help users select an appropriate analytical method for their
    analytical problem.
