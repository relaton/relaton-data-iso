    ISO/IEC 33003:2015 sets out the requirements for process measurement frameworks for use in process assessment. The requirements defined in ISO/IEC 33003:2015 form a structure which
    a)    establish the requirements for process measurement frameworks in the context of process assessment,
    b)    establish the requirements for the validation of process measurement frameworks for use in process assessment, and
    c)    establish requirements that are applicable to any process measurement frameworks to develop composite measures across domains.
    ISO/IEC 33003:2015 is applicable to the development of process measurement frameworks for any process quality characteristic across all application domains.
