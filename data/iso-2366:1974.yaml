abstract:
- content: The methods are applicable as alternatives to products for which the molar
    ratio NaF/AlF3 is equal to about 3. The principle of the flame emission method
    consists in atomization of the test solution in a flame of oxygen/hydrogen and
    determination by measurement of the intensity of the radiation at 589 nm. The
    principle of the flame atomic absorption method is based on atomization in an
    air/acetylene flame and measuremnt of the absorption of the 589 nm line emitted
    by a sodium hollow-cathode lamp. The preparation of the test solution is carried
    out by dissolution of a test portion in hydrochloric acid and water after attack
    by concentreted sulphuric acid.
