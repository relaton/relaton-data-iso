     ISO 20805:2005 applies to continuous hot-rolled steel sheet of higher yield strength with improved formability. The steel is killed, made according to a fine-grain practice and has a suitable chemical composition, which shall include microalloying elements, to provide improved formability. The steel may be treated to achieve inclusion control. The product is intended for applications where parts are to be fabricated requiring better formability than is provided by normal high-yield-strength steel sheet. It is generally used in the as-delivered condition. This product is commonly produced on a wide strip mill.
     This product is commonly produced in the range of thicknesses greater than 6 mm to 25 mm, and widths of 600 mm and over, in coils.
