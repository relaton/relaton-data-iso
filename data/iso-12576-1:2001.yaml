    This part of ISO 12576 establishes five systems for the conformity control of thermal insulating materials and
    products for buildings that are factory made.
    Its purpose is to provide uniform methods that are used to determine whether a production or a consignment of a
    thermal insulating material should be accepted as conforming to the relevant specification requirements.
    This part of ISO 12576 provides minimum requirements for each of the systems.
    Other systems may be additionally applied when agreed upon between the supplier and purchaser.
