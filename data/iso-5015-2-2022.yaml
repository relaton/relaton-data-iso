    This document specifies the requirements for vertiport operations (e.g. removal of contaminants, noise) and interface with an unmanned aircraft system (UAS) or vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aircraft operators and with UAS traffic management (UTM) service providers (SPs).
    This document is applicable to operations of vertiports belonging to any type, supporting:
    a) demonstration of compliance with applicable regulations of vertiport operations to aviation authorities or other public authorities, as a possible acceptable means of compliance (AMC), when applicable regulations require such involvement from the authority and when the authority considers this document acceptable;
    b) attestation of compliance of vertiport operations by qualified entities or other accredited, competent and independent third parties, supporting the safety risk assessment of the UAS operations required by regulations, in particular when high level of assurance robustness is required;
    c) attestation of compliance of vertiport operations by qualified entities or other accredited, competent and independent third parties even in the absence of any applicable regulation.
    This document also covers safety of the vertiport operator and quality of data provided by the vertiport operator to other entities (e.g. UAS operators, service providers of aeronautical information, providers of UTM services).
    Aspects that are not covered by this document are:
    —    requirements for operational procedures of UAS;
    —    requirements for physical characteristics and equipment for vertiports;
    —    requirements for UTM SPs.
