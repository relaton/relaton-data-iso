  content: ISO/IEC 14543-5-7:2015(E) specifies the architecture and framework for
    the remote access of IGRS devices and services in the home electronic system.
    The remote access communications protocol and application profiles are specified
    in other parts of this series. The relationship among these parts is specified
    in this standard. It is applicable to the remote access of an IGRS sub-network
    (called an IGRS subnet) for resource sharing and service collaboration among home
    and/or remote computers, consumer electronics and communication devices.
