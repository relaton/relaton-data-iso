abstract:
- content: The determination is carried out by using a rotary viscometer. It is applicable
    to liquid products, the dynamic viscosity of which lies between 10 and 80000 mN.s/m2.
    The principle consists in the determination at a temperature of (20 +- 0,2) °C
    by measuring the couple required to overcome the resistance exercised by the viscous
    liquid on an immersed element rotating within it at a constant selcted speed without
    causing a vortex. If the results obtained at different speeds of the immersed
    element are in agreement, the fluid is Newtonian. If the opposite is noted, the
    fluid is non-Newtonian.
