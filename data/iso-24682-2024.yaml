    This document provides requirements on fire resistance, acoustic insulation, opening and penetration  for “B” class fire-resistant compartment systems made of composite mineral wool panel, which are aligned with the 2010 FTP Code and SOLAS 74 and its amendments. This document also specifies how these “B” class fire-resistant compartment systems are inspected.
    This document is applicable to accommodation spaces made by “B” class composite mineral wool panels for ships and offshore installations where “B” class divisions are required.
