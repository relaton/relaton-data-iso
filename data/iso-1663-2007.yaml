  content: "ISO 1663:2007 specifies a method of determining the water vapour transmission
    rate, water vapour permeance, water vapour permeability and water vapour diffusion
    resistance index for rigid cellular plastics. \nThe scope of this method provides
    for the testing of rigid cellular materials that have thicknesses from 10 mm upwards
    and which may, as an integral part of the material, contain natural skins or adhered
    facings of some different material.\nThree different sets of temperature and humidity
    conditions are provided, as follows:\nThe results obtained by this method are
    suitable for design purposes and production control, and for inclusion in product
    specifications.\nThe method is suitable for materials which have water vapour
    transmission rates in the range 3 ng/(m2.s) to 200 ng/(m2.s)."
