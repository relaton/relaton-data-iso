    This part of ISO/IEC 29110 is applicable to Very Small Entities (VSEs). VSEs are enterprises, organizations, departments or projects of up to 25 people. The lifecycle processes described in ISO/IEC 29110 are not intended to preclude or discourage their use by organizations bigger than VSEs.

    This part of ISO/IEC 29110 provides the management and engineering guide to the Basic VSE Profile specified in ISO/IEC 29110-4-1 through project management and software implementation processes. This part of ISO/IEC 29110 is a standalone guide; it is not intended for a VSE to use the standardized profile to implement this part of ISO/IEC 29110.

    This part of ISO/IEC 29110 applies for software development projects, which can be to fulfil an external or internal contract. The internal contract need not be explicit between the project team and their Customer. Using this part of ISO/IEC 29110, a VSE can obtain the following benefits.
    ⎯ An agreed set of project requirements and expected products is delivered to the Customer.
    ⎯ A disciplined management process that provides project visibility and corrective actions of project
    problems and deviations is performed.
    ⎯ A systematic software implementation process that satisfies Customer needs and ensures quality
    products is followed.
