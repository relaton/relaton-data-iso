- content: |-
    This document specifies the definition for services at the point of interaction between a client and server.
    The following are within the scope of this document:
    —    the specification of the structure, components and conventions for domain- and technology-independent services implementation methods for STEP (ISO 10303-1);
    —    transformation of the SysML metamodel constructs to OpenAPI constructs for RESTful web services (see OpenAPI:3.0.0[25] and IETF RFC7231).
    The following are outside the scope of this document:
    —    domain specific services definitions;
    —    the transformation of SysML metamodel constructs into OpenAPI constructs that are not used in the STEP extended architecture[12][13];
    —    the transformation of SysML metamodel constructs into OpenAPI constructs for other purposes than representing SysML constructs as STEP concepts;
    —    codes and scripts to transform SysML XMI to OpenAPI schema;
    —    the transformation of SysML constraints into OpenAPI schema;
    —    implementation of technology-specific services definitions other than RESTful OpenAPI;
    —    definition of management and maintenance of information and data on a server.
