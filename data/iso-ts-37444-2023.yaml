abstract:
- content: "This document defines the charging performance metrics to be used during
    the evaluation or on-going monitoring of an electronic fee collection (EFC) system
    and the examination framework for the measurement of these metrics.\nIt specifies
    a method for the specification and documentation of a specific examination framework
    which can be used by the responsible entity to evaluate charging performance for
    a particular information exchange interface or for overall charging performance
    within a toll scheme.\nThe following scheme types are within the scope of this
    document:\na)    discrete schemes;\nb)    continuous schemes (autonomous type
    of systems).\nThis document defines measurements only on standardized interfaces.\nThis
    document defines metrics for the charging performance of EFC systems in terms
    of the level of errors associated with charging computation.\nThis document describes
    a set of metrics with definitions, principles and formulations, which together
    make up a reference framework for the establishment of requirements for EFC systems
    and the subsequent examination of charging performance.\nThis document defines
    metrics for the following information exchanges:\n—   charge reports (including
    usage evidence);\n—   toll declarations;\n—   exception lists;\n—   billing details
    and associated event data;\n—   payment claims on the level of service user accounts;\n—  
    end-to-end metrics which assess the overall performance of the charging process.\nThese
    metrics focus solely on the outcome of the charging process, i.e. the amount charged
    in relation to a pre-measured or theoretically correct amount, rather than intermediate
    variables from various components as sensors, such as positioning accuracy, signal
    range or optical resolution. This approach ensures comparable results for each
    metric in all relevant situations.\nThe following aspects are outside the scope
    of this document.\n—   Definition of specific numeric performance bounds, or average
    or worst-case error bounds in percentage or monetary units.\n—   Specification
    of a common reference system which would be required for comparison of performance
    between systems.\n—   Measurements on proprietary interfaces. \nNOTE           
    It is not possible to define standardized metrics on such system properties. Neither
    is it possible to define metrics for parts of the charging processing chain which
    are considered to be the internal matter of an interoperability partner, such
    as:\n—                   equipment performance, e.g. for on-board equipment (OBE),
    roadside equipment (RSE) or data centres such as signal range, optical resolution
    or computing system availability;\n—                   position performance metrics:
    the quality of data generated by position sensors is considered as an internal
    aspect of the GNSS front end. It is masked by correction algorithms, filtering,
    inferring of data and the robustness of the charge object recognition algorithms.\n—  
    The evaluation of the expected performance of a system based on modelling and
    measured data from a trial at another place."
