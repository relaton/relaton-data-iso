abstract:
- content: 'ISO/TS 24857:2006 gives the results of a study to determine the feasibility
    of the DiaTest-SI single particle strength tester as a system for measuring the
    compressive strength of synthetic industrial diamond grit products. Issues that
    were addressed included: the range of grit products (in terms of both size and
    strength) for which the DiaTest-SI system was appropriate, the choice of distribution
    statistics with which to describe diamond strength, and the similarities (at a
    statistically significant level) of the results from various test centres.'
