abstract:
- content: |-
    This document describes a framework for Functional Safety to assist the development of safety-related systems incorporating existing software products not developed in accordance with international safety standards, like ISO 26262. This framework provides possible methods and measures that can be adopted to claim that the software product is sufficiently safe once embedded within a system-on-chip and indications for creating a complete Technical Safety Concept. These indications address technical aspects to implement functional safety in order to demonstrate the architectural capability of a generic software product in the context of the overall safety-related system; others address the software development process to demonstrate the robustness against systematic failures.
    This document provides a detailed and exhaustive qualification concept applicable for generic complex pre-existing SW product with the aim of achieving equivalence safety assurance with the principles underlying ISO 26262 (basically derived from Part 4, Part 6 and 8), where applicable. The methods and measures listed in ISO 26262 have been assessed with respect to the underlying rationale to achieve the standard’s goal.
