abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: ISO/IEC 20382-2:2017 specifies the functional components of face-to-face
    speech translation designed to interoperate among multiple translation systems
    with different languages. It also specifies the speech translation features, general
    requirements and functionality, thus providing a framework to support a convenient
    speech translation service in face-to-face situations. This document is applicable
    to speech translation devices, servers and communication protocols among speech
    translation servers and clients in a high-level approach. ISO/IEC 20382-2:2017
    also defines various system architectures in different environments. ISO/IEC 20382-2:2017
    is not applicable to defining speech recognition engines, language translation
    engines and speech synthesis engines.
