abstract:
- content: This document is focused on measuring the autofocus (AF) repeatability
    of sharpness and latency, meaning camera system’s capability to produce sharp
    images within certain time frame. The scope of document is limited to testing
    autofocus sharpness and latency repeatability with stationary charts only as testing
    with moving charts is not covered.
