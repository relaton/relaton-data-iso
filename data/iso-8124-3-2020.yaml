    1.1  This document specifies maximum acceptable levels and methods of sampling, extraction and determination for the migration of the elements antimony, arsenic, barium, cadmium, chromium, lead, mercury and selenium from toy materials and from parts of toys.
    1.2  Maximum acceptable levels are specified for the migration of the elements listed in 1.1 from the following toy materials:
    —     coatings of paints, varnishes, lacquers, printing inks, polymers and similar coatings (see 9.1);
    —     polymeric and similar material, including laminates, whether textile-reinforced or not, but excluding other textiles and non-woven textiles (see 9.2);
    —     paper and paperboard (see 9.3);
    —     natural, artificial or synthetic textiles (see 9.4);
    —     glass/ceramic/metallic materials, excepting lead solder when used for electrical connections (see 9.5);
    —     other materials, whether mass-coloured or not (e.g. wood, fibreboard, hardboard, bone and leather) (see 9.6);
    —     materials intended to leave a trace (e.g. the graphite materials in pencils and liquid ink in pens) (see 9.7);
    —     pliable modelling materials, including modelling clays and gels (see 9.8);
    —     paints to be used as such in the toy, including finger paints, varnishes, lacquers, glazing powders and similar material in solid or liquid form (see 9.9).
    1.3  The requirements in this document apply to the following toys and toy components of toys and toy materials (see D.2.1):
    —     all intended food and oral contact toys, cosmetic toys and writing instruments categorized as toys, irrespective of any age grading or recommended age labelling;
    —     all toys intended for or suitable for children under 72 months of age;
    —     accessible coatings, irrespective of any age grading or recommended age labelling;
    —     accessible liquids, pastes and gels (e.g. liquid paints, modelling compounds), irrespective of any age grading or recommended age labelling.
    1.4  Packaging materials are not included, unless they are intended to be kept, for example boxes and containers, or unless they form part of the toy or have intended play value (see D.2.2).
    NOTE    No requirements are given for toys and parts of toys which, due to their accessibility, function, mass, size or other characteristics, are obviously unlikely to be sucked, licked or swallowed, bearing in mind the normal and foreseeable behaviour of children (e.g. the coating on the crossbeam of a swing set, the tyres of a toy bicycle).
