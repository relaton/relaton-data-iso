  content: The method is based on weighing a test portion, dissolving it in water,
    transfer of the solution to each of two Nessler colour-comparison cylinders, preparing
    a test solution by adding freshly prepared ammoniacal silver nitrate solution
    to one of the Nessler cylinders and mixing well, preparing a blank solution by
    adding ammonium hydroxide solution and water to the other Nessler cylinder and
    mixing well, allowing the solutions to stand for 2 min, and comparing the colour
    and turbidity of the two solutions.
