    This document provides validation metrics and rating procedures to calculate the level of correlation between two non-ambiguous signals obtained from a physical test and a computational model and it is aimed at vehicle safety applications. The objective comparison of time-history signals of model and test is validated against various loading cases under different types of physical loads such as forces, moments and accelerations. However, other applications can be possible too, but are not within the scope of this document.
    NOTE             Annex A gives some examples of the application of this document.
