  content: Helps to permit identification of pilot crafts in heavy weather, in order
    to improve the efficiency of pilot service and the safety of navigation. Is applicable
    to pilot craft used in closed waters, estuaries and open road-steads to bring
    and take off pilot to merchant ships. The applicability of the requirements to
    pilot craft navigating under a navy flag is determined by the competent authorities
    of the relevant country.
