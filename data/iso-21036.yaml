abstract:
- content: "This document specifies the characteristics and requirements for components
    such as pipes, fittings, and valves made from one of the following materials intended
    to be used for thermoplastics piping systems in the field of industrial applications
    above and below ground:\n—    unplasticized polyamide (PA-U)\nNOTE 1     Requirements
    for industrial valves are given in this document and/or in other standards. \nThis
    document is applicable to either PA-U pipes, fittings, valves, and their joints
    and to joints with components of other plastics and non-plastic materials, depending
    on their suitability, intended to be used for the conveyance of liquid and gaseous
    fluids as well as solid matter in fluids for industrial applications such as the
    following:\n—    transport of oil, gaseous fuels and multiphase mixtures (exploration
    and production; general purpose hydrocarbon-based fluids);\n—    transport of
    renewable gases (hydrogen, biomethane); \n—    transport of contaminated sewer
    (e.g. contaminated with hydrocarbons);\n—    transport of CO2 (carbon capture
    and utilisation or storage (CCUS))\nNOTE 2     National regulations can apply.\nOther
    application areas are permitted if the requirements of this document and/or applicable
    national requirements are fulfilled.\nCharacteristics and requirements which are
    applicable for PA-U are covered by the relevant clauses of this document. Those
    characteristics and requirements which are dependent on the material are given
    in the relevant normative annex A.\n "
