    This document specifies the properties of unalloyed and low-alloyed grey cast irons used for castings that have been manufactured in sand moulds or in moulds with comparable thermal behaviour.
    This document specifies the characterizing properties of grey cast irons by any of the following:
    a)    the tensile strength of cast samples;
    b)    if agreed by the manufacturer and the purchaser, the tensile strength of samples cut from a casting;
    c)    if agreed between the manufacturer and the purchaser, the hardness of the material determined on castings or on a cast-on knob.
    If agreed by the manufacturer and the purchaser, the combination of tensile strength from option a) or option b) and plus hardness from option c) can be specified. Information on specifying a combination of tensile strength and hardness is given in Annex B.
    This document specifies eight grades of grey cast iron according to tensile strength (see Table 1) and six grades of grey cast iron according to Brinell hardness (see Table 2).
    This document does not apply to grey cast irons used for pipes and pipe fittings and continuous cast products.
    This document does not cover technical delivery conditions for grey iron castings.
    NOTE       General information on the engineering properties of grey cast irons is provided in ISO/TR 10809-1.
