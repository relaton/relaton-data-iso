abstract:
- content: "This document specifies test methods and requirements for the strength
    and durability of all types of stays and hinges pivoting on a horizontal axis
    and their components for all fields of application.\n\nThe tests consist of the
    application of loads, forces and velocities simulating normal functional use,
    as well as misuse, that might reasonably be expected to occur.\n\nWith the exception
    of the corrosion test in 6.4, the tests are designed to evaluate properties without
    regard to materials, design/construction or manufacturing processes.\n\nThe strength
    and durability tests only relate to stays and hinges pivoting on a horizontal
    axis and the parts used for the attachement, e.g. screws.\n\nThe strength and
    durability tests are carried out in a test frame with specified properties. The
    test results can only be used as a guide to the performance of a piece of furniture.\n\nThe
    test results are only valid for the products tested. These results may be used
    to represent the performance of production models provided that the tested model
    is representative of the production model. \n\nAgeing and influences of heat and
    humidity are not included."
