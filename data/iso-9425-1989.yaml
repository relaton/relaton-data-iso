  content: Covers fibre building boards as defined in ISO 818, particle boards as
    defined in ISO 820, as well as plywood as defined in ISO 2074. The principle involves
    the determination, by weighing, of the loss in mass of a test piece between its
    state at the time of sampling and its state after drying to constant mass, and
    the calculation of this loss in mass after drying.
