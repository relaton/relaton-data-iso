    ISO 5950:2008 applies to cold-reduced carbon steel sheet of commercial and drawing qualities coated in coil form by electro-deposition of tin. The product is commonly known as electrolytic tin-coated sheet and is used where solderability is desired, appearance is important, or a degree of corrosion resistance under specific conditions is advantageous and coating mass can be specified. The coating is expressed as the total coating on both surfaces. in grams per square metre. The coating mass specified should be compatible with the desired service life, thickness of the base metal and the forming requirements involved. A designation system includes the coating designation, coating condition and quality.
    ISO 5950:2008 does not cover tinplate and blackplate.
