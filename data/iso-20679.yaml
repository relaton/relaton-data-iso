abstract:
- content: "These Testing Guidelines provide detailed and rigorous procedures for
    the independent performance testing of all forms of In-Water Cleaning (IWC) systems
    (i.e., both Proactive and Reactive systems) for external ship surfaces. This includes
    the various components or options of multicomponent systems for fouling removal
    (e.g., cleaning unit for flat hull surfaces and smaller handheld tools for more
    complex niche areas) or effluent treatment (e.g., physical separation for captured
    solid material and treatment for dissolved biocides and/or live organisms). \nThese
    Guidelines will allow specific IWC systems to be tested in a standardized way
    that is appropriate to their design, operational requirements/limits, and their
    individual service providers’ claims."
