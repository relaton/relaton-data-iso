    This document describes the phased array ultrasonic testing (PAUT) of polyethylene butt fusion (BF) joints, including pipe-to-pipe, pipe-to-fitting and fitting-to-fitting joints, used for the conveyance of fluids. This document provides a test, whereby the presence of imperfections such as voids, inclusions, lack of fusions, misalignment and particulate contamination in the BF joints can be detected. The document is only applicable to polyethylene pipes and fittings without a barrier to ultrasonic waves.
    This document also provides requirements for procedure qualification and guidance for personnel qualifications, which are essential for the application of this test technique.
    This document also covers the equipment, the preparation and performance of the test, the indication assessment and the reporting for polyethylene BF joints.
    Acceptance criteria are not covered in this document.
