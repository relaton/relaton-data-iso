abstract:
- content: |-
    ISO/IEC 30130:2016 defines the framework to which capabilities of software testing tools are allocated in order to identify the capabilities of products being used by any project for software testing. Software testing processes are identified in ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119‑2 and software verification processes are identified in ISO/IEC 12207. This International Standard is fully harmonized with these existing standards in terms of software testing processes.
    ISO/IEC 30130:2016 focuses on the following areas that the existing ISO/IEC standards do not deal with the following:
    -      categorization of software test entities and software testing tools (Clauses 4 and 5);
    -      characterization of each software testing tool category (Clauses 5 and 6);
    -      mapping of software testing tool capabilities and characteristics (Clauses 6 and 7).
