abstract:
- content: "ISO/TS 18876 (all parts) establishes an architecture, a methodology and
    other specifications for integrating industrial data for exchange, access and
    sharing. Together these support the following activities:\n- integrating data
    which may be:from different sources or with different model contexts,described
    by different models, ordefined in different modelling languages;\n- sharing data
    among applications through systems integration architectures;\n- resolving conflict
    between models developed with different objectives;\n- translating data between
    different encodings;\n- translating models between different modelling languages.
    \nISO/TS 18876-2:2003 specifies methods for the following:\n- creating and extending
    integration models;\n- evaluating and selecting an integration model that can
    integrate two or more application models;\n- creating an application model that
    is a constrained subset of an integration model to support particular application
    domain requirements for exchange, sharing, or both; \n- creating a mapping specification
    between an application model and an integration model.\nThe following are within
    the scope of ISO/TS 18876-2:2003:\n- modelling language independent methods for
    creating and extending an integration model;\n- methods for integrating an application
    model with an integration model;\n- mapping language independent methods for mapping
    an application model to an integration model;\n- criteria for the selecting modelling
    languages and mapping languages that can be used within the specified methods
    for integration and mapping.\nThe following are outside the scope of ISO/TS 18876-2:2003:\n-
    the structure and content of particular integration models;\n- methods for creating
    and extending particular integration models;\n- methods for mapping application
    models to particular integration models.\nNOTE The specific methods that apply
    to mappings between particular application models and integration models depend
    on the modelling paradigm(s) applied and on the structure and content of the models."
