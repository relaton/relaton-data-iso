    ISO 17325-1:2014 specifies the basic design requirements, general function, designations and marking of oil booms. It further specifies minimum information regarding design, dimensions and materials of oil booms to be provided by the manufacturer.
    The intent of ISO 17325-1:2014 is to assist manufacturers and facilitate user selection of booms by technical criteria. It does not purport to address all aspects of booms or safety concerns associated with boom use, nor does it define boom operational procedures. It is the responsibility of the user of this International Standard to establish the appropriate safety and health practices, and determine applicability of regulatory limitations.
