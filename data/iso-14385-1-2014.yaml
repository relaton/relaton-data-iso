    ISO 14385-1:2014 specifies the procedures for establishing quality assurance for automated measuring systems (AMS) installed on industrial plants for the determination of the concentration of greenhouse gases in flue and waste gas and other flue gas parameters.
    ISO 14385-1:2014 specifies a procedure to calibrate the AMS and determine the variability of the measured values obtained by an AMS, which is suitable for the validation of an AMS following its installation.
    ISO 14385-1:2014 is designed to be used after the AMS has been accepted according to the procedures specified in ISO 14956.
