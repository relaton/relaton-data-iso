- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: The main objective of ISO 9276-5:2005 is to provide the background for
    the representation of a cumulative particle size distribution which follows a
    logarithmic normal probability distribution, as a means by which calculations
    performed using particle size distribution functions may be unequivocally checked.
    The design of logarithmic normal probability graph paper is explained, as well
    as the calculation of moments, median diameters, average diameters, and volume-specific
    surface area. Logarithmic normal probability distributions are often suitable
    for the representation of cumulative particle size distributions of any dimensionality.
    Their particular advantage lies in the fact that cumulative distributions, such
    as number-, length-, area-, volume- or mass-distributions, are represented by
    parallel lines, all of whose locations may be determined from a knowledge of the
    location of any one.
