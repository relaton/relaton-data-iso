  content: "This document specifies requirements for portable units which are part
    of a transportable liquid oxygen system. These are used as a supply source for
    oxygen therapy in home-care and in health-care facilities. \nPortable units are
    intended to be carried by patients whilst moving around and during their off-site
    activities and can be refilled from a base unit through a transfilling connector.
    Portable units are used without professional supervision."
