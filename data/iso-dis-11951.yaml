    ISO 11951:2016 specifies requirements for single and double cold-reduced blackplate in the form of coils which are intended for manufacturing electrolytic tinplate or electrolytic chromium/chromium oxide-coated steel (ECCS) in accordance with ISO 11949 or ISO 11950.
    Single cold-reduced blackplate is generally specified in nominal thicknesses that are multiples of 0,005 mm from 0,150 mm up to and including 0,600 mm. Double cold-reduced blackplate is generally specified in nominal thicknesses that are multiples of 0,005 mm, from 0,100 mm up to and including 0,360 mm.
    ISO 11951:2016 applies to coils in nominal minimum rolling widths of 600 mm[1] with either trimmed or untrimmed edges.
    [1] Nominal minimum rolling widths of 500 mm may be applied by agreement between the purchaser and the manufacturer.
