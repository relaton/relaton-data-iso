    ISO/IEC 9496:2003 defines the ITU-T programming language CHILL. CHILL is a strongly typed, block structured and object-oriented language designed primarily for the implementation of large and complex embedded systems.
    CHILL was designed to provide reliability and run time efficiency, at the same time sufficient flexibility and powerfulness to encompass the required range of applications. CHILL also provides facilities that encourage piecewise and modular development of large systems.
