  content: "ISO/IEC 25045:2010 is one of the SQuaRE series of International Standards,
    which provides a framework for software products quality requirements and evaluation
    including the requirements for methods of software product measurement and evaluation.
    \nISO/IEC 25045:2010 uses a methodology involving two types of evaluation for
    recoverability. One part of the method makes use of the disturbance injection
    methodology and a list of disturbances based on common categories of operational
    faults and events to evaluate the quality measure of resiliency. The second quality
    measure is based on a set of questions that is defined for each disturbance to
    evaluate the quality measure of autonomic recovery index by assessing how well
    the system detects, analyses, and resolves the disturbance without human intervention.
    \nISO/IEC 25045:2010 is applicable to information systems executing transactions
    in a system supporting single or multiple concurrent users, where speedy recovery
    and ease of managing recovery is important to the acquirer, owner/operator, and
    the developer."
