abstract:
- content: "This document establishes definitions and evaluation methods for wheel-rail
    contact geometry parameters influencing the vehicle running dynamic behaviour:\n-
    the rolling radius difference between the two wheels of a wheelset (Δr-function)
    which serves as a basis for all further calculations;\n- the equivalent conicity
    function from which are derived:\n•\ta single equivalent conicity value for a
    specified amplitude which is relevant for the assessment of vehicle running stability
    on straight track and in very large radius curves;\n•\tthe nonlinearity parameter
    which characterizes the shape of this function and is related to the vehicle behaviour
    particularly in the speed range close to the running stability limit;\n- the rolling
    radii coefficient which is used to describe the theoretical radial steering capability
    of a wheelset in a curved track.\nAdditional information is given about the relationship
    between the contact angles of the two wheels of a wheelset (Δtanγ-function) and
    about the roll angle parameter.\nDescriptions of possible calculation methods
    are included in this document. Test case calculations are provided to achieve
    comparable results and to check the proper implementation of the described algorithms.\nTo
    validate alternative methods not described in this document acceptance criteria
    are given for the equivalent conicity function. This includes reference profiles,
    profile combinations, tolerances and reference results with tolerance limits.\nThis
    document also includes minimum requirements for the measurement of wheel and rail
    profiles as well as of the parameters needed for the transformation into a common
    coordinate system of right- and left-hand profiles.\nThis document does not define
    limits for the wheel-rail contact geometry parameters and gives no tolerances
    for the rail profile and the wheel profile to achieve acceptable results.\nFor
    the application of this document some general recommendations are given."
