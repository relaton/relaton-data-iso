abstract:
- content: The method is applicable to products having silica contents exceeding 10
    mg/kg. The principle is based on the formation of yellow oxidized silico-molybdic
    complex in a strongly acid medium, in the presence of boric acid to suppress interference
    by fluorides. Selective reduction of this complex with a mixture of aminonaphtholsulphonic
    acid (4-amino-3-hydroxynaphthalene-1-sulphonic acid), sodium metabisulphite and
    sodium sulphite, in the presence of oxalic acid and in a strongly acid medium
    so as to suppress interference by phosphates. Photometric measurement of the blue-coloured
    complex at a wavelength of about 795 nm.
