    ISO/IEC 19770-2:2015 establishes specifications for tagging software to optimize its identification and management.
    This part of ISO/IEC 19770 applies to the following.
    a)   Tag producers: these organizations and/or tools create software identification (SWID) tags for use by others in the market. A tag producer may be part of the software creator organization, the software licensor organization, or be a third-party organization. These organizations and/or tools can broadly be broken down into the following categories.
    b)   Tag consumers: these tools and/or organizations utilize information from SWID tags and are typically broken down into the following two major categories:
    ISO/IEC 19770-2:2015 does not prescribe Information Technology Asset Management (ITAM) or other IT-related processes required for reconciliation of software entitlements with software identification tags or other IT requirements.
    ISO/IEC 19770-2:2015 is not intended to conflict either with any organization's policies, procedures or standards or with any national or international laws and regulations.
