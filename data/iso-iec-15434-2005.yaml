abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 15434:2005 defines the manner in which data is transferred to
    high-capacity ADC media from a supplier's information system and the manner in
    which data is transferred to the recipient's information system. ISO/IEC 15434:2005
    does not define the internal data storage format for specific high-capacity ADC
    media. ISO/IEC 15434:2005 does not specify the application of data structures
    provided by a specific data syntax format. The application of the data structure
    is specified by industry conventions.\nUsers of automatic data capture (ADC) technologies
    benefit by being able to receive data in a standard form and by being able to
    provide data in a standard form. Static ADC technologies such as bar code symbologies,
    magnetic stripe, optical character recognition, surface acoustical wave (SAW),
    and Weigand effect typically encode a single field of data. Most applications
    of these technologies involve the encoding of a single field of data by the supplier
    of the medium and the subsequent decoding of the data field by the recipient.
    Encoding single fields of data permits the supplier to perform the encodation
    from a single field within the supplier's information system. Decoding single
    fields of data permits the recipient to input this data into a single field in
    the recipient's information system, in lieu of key entry.\nHigh-capacity ADC technologies,
    such as two-dimensional symbols, RFID transponders, contact memories, and smart
    cards, encode multiple fields of data. These multiple fields usually are parsed
    by the recipient's information system and then mapped to specific fields of data
    in the recipient's information system. ISO/IEC 15434:2005 defines the syntax for
    high-capacity ADC media, so as to enable ADC users to utilize a single mapping
    utility, regardless of which high-capacity ADC media is employed.\nISO/IEC 15434:2005
    specifies a transfer structure, syntax, and coding of messages and data formats
    when using high-capacity ADC media between trading partners (specifically between
    suppliers and recipients) and, where applicable, in support of carrier applications,
    such as bills of lading and carrier sortation and tracking.\nThe data encoded
    according to ISO/IEC 15434:2005 includes\n- data which may be used in the shipping,
    receiving, and inventory of transport units;\n- data which may be contained within
    supporting documentation, in paper or electronic form, related to unit loads or
    transport packages;\n- data which may be used in the sortation and tracking of
    transport units.\nISO/IEC 15434:2005 describes the ISO 646 syntax for automatic
    data capture. \nISO/IEC 15434:2005 is not the controlling specification for data
    structures (e.g. CII) referenced in ISO/IEC 15434:2005.\nISO/IEC 15434:2005 does
    not supersede or replace any applicable safety or regulatory marking or labelling
    requirements. ISO/IEC 15434:2005 is to be applied in addition to any other mandated
    labelling requirements."
