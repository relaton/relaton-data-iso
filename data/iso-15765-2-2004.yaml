  content: ISO 15765-2:2004 specifies a network protocol tailored to meet the requirements
    of CAN-based vehicle network systems on controller area networks as specified
    in ISO 11898. It has been defined in accordance with the diagnostic services established
    in ISO 14229-1 and ISO 15031-5, but is not limited to use with them, and is also
    compatible with most other communication needs for in-vehicle networks. The protocol
    specifies an unconfirmed communication.
