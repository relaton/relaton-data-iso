    This document provides a scheme for the assessment of conformity of RFC products for the rehabilitation of existing pipelines, in accordance with the applicable parts of ISO 11296, ISO 11297 and ISO 11298, and intended to be included in the manufacturer’s quality plan as part of the quality management system and for the establishment of certification procedures.
    It applies to cured-in-place pipe (CIPP) products only. It applies to non-pressure pipe liners, and to independent (fully structural, class A) and interactive (semi-structural, class B) pressure pipe liners, as defined in ISO 11295, which do not rely on adhesion to the existing pipeline.
    NOTE In order to help the reader, summary tables of overall scheme requirements are provided in Annex E.
