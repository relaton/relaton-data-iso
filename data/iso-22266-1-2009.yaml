    ISO 22266-1:2009 provides guidelines for applying shaft torsional vibration criteria, under normal operating conditions, for the coupled shaft system and long blades of a turbine generator set. In particular, these apply to the torsional natural frequencies of the coupled shaft system at line and twice‑line frequencies of the electrical network to which the turbine generator set is connected. In the event that torsional natural frequencies do not conform with defined frequency margins, other possible actions available to vendors are defined.
    ISO 22266-1:2009 is applicable to land-based steam turbine generator sets for power stations with power outputs greater than 50 MW and normal operating speeds of 1 500 r/min, 1 800 r/min, 3 000 r/min and 3 600 r/min, and to land-based gas turbine generator sets for power stations with power outputs greater than 50 MW and normal operating speeds of 3 000 r/min and 3 600 r/min.
    Methods currently available for carrying out both analytical assessments and test validation of the shaft system torsional natural frequencies are also described.
