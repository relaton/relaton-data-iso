abstract:
- content: Establish a common vocabulary for finished silicon nitride rolling elements
    surface imperfections, along with descriptions and characteristics, and provide
    example pictures of specified surface imperfections. Rolling elements stands for
    balls and rollers. Imperfections defined in this document correspond to patterns
    found on finished rolling elements before use. Deviations from the geometric product
    specifications (GPS) are not dealt with in this document. This document does not
    give criteria for the acceptance limits of these imperfections. The identification
    of an imperfection is done by the different actors involved in the manufacturing,
    mounting or final using of the silicon nitride parts, depending on the technical
    specifications and the criticality of the application.
