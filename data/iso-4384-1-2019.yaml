    This document specifies parameters for the hardness testing of compound materials for plain bearings made from steel and bearing metal with bearing metals based on copper and aluminium, manufactured by casting, sintering or bonding. It represents a supplement to the existing ISO publications on hardness testing and, therefore, includes only the extensions and restrictions to be observed compared to those publications.
    The measuring method applied depends on the bearing metal layer thickness, its hardness and its structure.
