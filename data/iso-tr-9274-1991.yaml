  content: Establishes guidelines for measurement of dimensions, running accuracy
    and internal clearance of both radial and thrust rolling bearings. The purpose
    is to outline the fundamentals of various measuring and gauging principles which
    may be used in order to comply with the definitions of ISO 1132 and ISO 5593.
    The methods described in this Technical Report do differ amongst themselves and
    there are other adequate measuring and gauging methods. ISO/TR 9274 does not imply
    any obligation to apply any particular method. However, the methods specified
    may be referred to in cases of dispute.
