    This document establishes a uniform, safe and consistent approach to training and assessment of personnel to enable them to establish and maintain the required competencies in relation to maintenance, thorough examination, operational testing, overhaul and repair of lifeboats (including free-fall lifeboats) and rescue boats (including fast rescue boats), launching appliances and release gear.
    It also provides the necessary information for interested parties to grant authorization, effectively evaluate and audit training, supporting the IMO Requirements, Section 3.
    It specifies the initial training programme for personnel certified by a manufacture or by an authorized service provider to carry out maintenance, thorough examination, operational testing, overhaul and repair of lifeboats (including free-fall lifeboats) and rescue boats (including fast rescue boats), launching appliances and release gear. This document specifies the training requirements for Initial Service Technician training only.
    This document is intended to be used in conjunction with ISO/PAS 23678-1, ISO/PAS 23678-3 and ISO/PAS 23678-4.
    This document is applicable to the following types of lifeboats (including free-fall lifeboats), rescue boats (including fast rescue boats), launching appliances and release gear.
