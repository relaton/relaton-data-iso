abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 11160 is intended to facilitate users in selecting a printer which
    meets their requirements.\nISO/IEC 11160 specifies the minimum information to
    be included in the specification sheets of printers in order for users to compare
    the characteristics of different machines. The term \"Specification Sheets\" applies
    to documents which describe the performance characteristics of the printers to
    be included in instruction manuals, product brochures or on websites.\nISO/IEC
    11160 applies to printers that could be operated in an office environment. Printers
    requiring specially equipped rooms or specially instructed operators are not considered
    in ISO/IEC 11160. \nISO/IEC 11160 deals with different classes of printers. ISO/IEC
    11160-2:2013 accommodates Class 3 and Class 4 printers, as defined in Annex C.
    Detailed descriptions of Class 3 and Class 4 printers are specified in Annex A.
    Serial printers are classified as Class 1 or Class 2 printers as defined in Annex
    C and covered by ISO/IEC 11160-1."
