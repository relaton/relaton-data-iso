    ISO 19973-5:2015 provides test procedures for assessing the reliability of the following types of pneumatic valves:
    ?   non-return (check) valves;
    ?   pilot-operated non-return valves;
    ?   shuttle valves;
    ?   dual pressure valves (AND function);
    ?   one-way adjustable flow control valves;
    ?   quick-exhaust valves
    by testing and the methods of reporting the results of testing. General test conditions and the calculation method are provided in ISO 19973‑1. The methods specified in ISO 19973‑1 apply to the first failure, as obtained with the three-points moving average (3PMA) method, without repairs, but excluding outliers.
    The lifetime of these pneumatic valves is usually given as a number of cycles. Therefore, whenever the term "time" is used in this part of ISO 19973-5:2015, this variable is understood as a number of cycles.
    ISO 19973-5:2015 also specifies test equipment and threshold levels for tests to assess the reliability of these pneumatic valves.
