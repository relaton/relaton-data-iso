abstract:
- content: 'Defines test procedures for determining the mechanical performance of
    precast concrete floors made of a single piece, or made up of precast joists (reinforced
    concrete or precast concrete) completed with filler blocks and concrete poured
    in situ. The parameters measured are: the maximum load, which does not result
    in collapse, the instantaneous and deferred deformations under imposed load, and
    the maximum load which the floor or its constituent precast element can support
    without collapse during its construction. Applies to floors designed to support
    loads of less than 5000 N m^-2 and having spans of less than 12 m.'
