abstract:
- content: ISO 17282:2004 gives guidelines for the acquisition and presentation of
    data that can be used for design with plastics. Emphasis is given to the acquisition
    of data needed by computerised methods for design. It includes data needed for
    the analysis of the flow of polymer melts during the manufacture of a component
    as well as data needed for the prediction of mechanical performance of the component
    in service. The data requirements cover design with unfilled plastics as well
    as filled, short-fibre reinforced and continuous-fibre reinforced materials.
