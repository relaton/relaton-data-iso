abstract:
- content: "This document defines requirements for collision warning systems (CWS)
    and collision avoidance systems (CAS) that address swing/rotation motion for:\n—\tearth
    moving machinery as defined in ISO 6165;\n—\tmobile underground mining machinery
    as defined in ISO 19296; and\n—\troad construction machinery as defined in ISO
    22242.\nThis document covers intended object between the ground plane of the machine
    and the top of the machine operator cabin. Thus this document does not cover the
    risk of collision with parts of the intended objects that are higher than the
    top of the machine operator cabin. This document does not consider machine height
    of working tool (e.g. hight of boom and arm).\nThis document covers collision
    avoidance by motion inhibition prior to initiation of rotational motion; it does
    not cover avoidance by automatic application of the braking or inhibit or automatic
    manoeuvring (e.g. raise bucket) away from the intended object. It also covers
    collision warning and avoidance for machine movement caused by the swing/rotation
    of a machine or parts of a machine. \nThere are two factors that increase the
    collision risk level (CRL) of a stationary rotation machine and this document
    deals with those cases:\n—\twhen there is a risk of collision due to the presence
    of a stationary intended object before the start of machine rotation, and/or\n—\twhen
    the intended object itself moves and comes towards the machine before the start
    of the motion and increases the risk of collision.\nTherefore, this document describes
    two types of collision risk levels (CRL): \"rotation angle with stationary intended
    object\" and \"distance between the stationary machine and the moving intended
    object\".\nThe system described in this standard is intended to assist the operator
    of the machine.   The responsibility for safe operation of the machine remains
    with the machine operator. \nThis document is not applicable to collision warning
    and collision avoidance systems installed/manufactured before the date of its
    publication."
