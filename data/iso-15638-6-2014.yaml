    ISO 15638-6:2014 specifies the common roles and responsibilities of actors providing regulated application systems which use TARV to provide regulated application services for regulated commercial freight vehicles and the interoperability of key operational steps and actions required to support all TARV regulated application service systems.
    ISO 15638-6:2014 specifies the general conditions for data exchanges between an application service provider and vehicle IVS, and from other ITS-stations to the IVS of the regulated commercial freight vehicle, and specifies generic data concepts for identified services, but it does not define the detailed aspects of the application services or their implementation (application specific aspects being defined in ISO 15638-8 to ISO 15638-19 for each identified application service).
    ISO 15638-6 addresses the general and common requirements for the provision of regulated application services that require data in addition to, or instead of, basic vehicle data and core application data (application specific aspects being defined in ISO 15638-8 to ISO 15638-19 for each identified application service).
    ISO 15638-6:2014 provides common aspects of specifications for communications and data exchange aspects of identified application services (as defined in ISO 15638-8 to ISO 15638-19) that a regulator may elect to require or support as an option, including
    a)    high-level definition of the service that a service provider has to provide [the service definition describes common service elements; but does not define the detail of how such an application service is instantiated, not the acceptable value ranges of the data concepts defined],
    b)    means to realize the service, and
    c)    application data common to all parts as defined in ISO 15638-8 to ISO 15638-19, naming content and quality that an IVS has to deliver.
    ISO 15638-6:2014 has been developed for use in the context of regulated commercial freight vehicles (hereinafter referred to as regulated vehicles). There is nothing however to prevent a jurisdiction extending or adapting the scope to include other types of regulated vehicles, as it deems appropriate.
