- content: |-
    This document addresses the physical security of data centres based upon the criteria and classifications for "availability", "security" and "energy efficiency enablement" within ISO/IEC TS 22237‑1.
    This document provides designations for the data centre spaces defined in ISO/IEC TS 22237‑1.
    This document specifies requirements and recommendations for those data centre spaces, and the systems employed within those spaces, in relation to protection against:
    a)    unauthorized access addressing constructional, organizational and technological solutions;
    b)    fire events igniting within data centre spaces;
    c)    other events within or outside the data centre spaces, which would affect the defined level of protection.
    Safety and electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) requirements are outside the scope of this document and are covered by other standards and regulations. However, information given in this document may be of assistance in meeting these standards and regulations.
