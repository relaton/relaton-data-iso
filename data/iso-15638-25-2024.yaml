    This document specifies a freight vehicle safety information provisioning service application or function. It is intended for use within non-enforcement applications and potentially for regulated application services (RAS), for the road transport safety management purposes of regulated commercial freight vehicle movements.
    This document reinforces vehicle safety for non-enforcement purposes and other purposes by providing safety advisory information concerning overhead clearance provisions to freight vehicle drivers or operators transporting heavy goods on freight vehicles.
    This document specifies the framework for remote vehicle safety information provision for non-enforcement and for the conceptual operation of other management purpose applications.
    This document is intended to be beneficial to entities whose purpose is vehicle safety management. It provides additional use cases for TARV (telematics applications for regulated vehicles) service applications.
