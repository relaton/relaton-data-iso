abstract:
- content: Care should be taken that any test portion is representative of the sample
    with respect to the property or constituent to be determined. In case of compositions
    of the original mix any surface bloom should be incorporated, but for final bulk
    bloom should be removed. If test pieces are taken from manufacturer's products,
    vulcanized rubber has to be separated from other possible components which should
    be done by mechanical means to avoid heat generation.
