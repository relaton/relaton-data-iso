  content: This document specifies a method using photostimulated luminescence (PSL)
    to detect the radiation status of natural products. It can be used to identify
    whether raw and traditionally processed Chinese medicinal materials and solid
    forms of manufactured product made from these materials have been irradiated by
    ionizing radiation (gamma, X-ray or beam). It is not applicable for use in testing
    liquid dosage forms or partially solid extracted dosage forms that do not contain
    directly crushed medicinal materials.
