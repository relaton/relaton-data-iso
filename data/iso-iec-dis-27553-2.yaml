abstract:
- content: "This document provides high level security and privacy requirements for
    authentication using biometrics on mobile devices, including security and privacy
    requirements for functional components, for communication, for storage and for
    remote processing. \nThis document is applicable to remote modes, i.e., the cases
    that:\n-\tthe biometric sample is captured through mobile devices; \n-\tthe biometric
    data or derived biometric data are transmitted between the mobile devices and
    the remote services in either or both directions.\nThe cases that the biometric
    data or derived biometric data never leave the mobile devices (i.e., local modes)
    are out of scope for this document. \nThe preliminary steps for biometric enrolment
    before authentication procedure are out of scope for this document.\nThe use of
    biometric identification as part of the authentication procedure is out of scope
    for this document."
