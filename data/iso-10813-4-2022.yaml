    This document gives guidance for the selection of vibration generating equipment for multi-axial environmental testing, depending on the test requirements.
    Multi-axial environmental test equipment dealt with in this document refers to a vibration test system having controlled vibration of more than one degree of freedom, including linear vibration and angular vibration. In this document, one or more exciter per desired degree of freedom is supposed.
    The guidance covers such aspects of selection as
    —    number, type and models of exciters,
    —    number, type and models of connectors,
    —    system configuration, and
    —    some components.
