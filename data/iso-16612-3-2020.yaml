abstract:
- content: |-
    This document defines the PDF/VT-3 document format and methods to enable reliable document exchange for variable data and transactional (VT) printing. It uses the Portable Document Format (PDF) Version 2.0, as restricted by PDF/X-6, for the representation of such documents. It allows the specification of document structure and layout, content data, and interaction of graphics objects in a graphics model that supports transparency and both device-dependent and device-independent colour spaces. All elements are either included or provision is made for unique identification of externally supplied ICC profiles.
    PDF/VT-3 is designed to enable variable data and transactional printing in a variety of environments from desktop printers to digital production presses. This includes hybrid workflows involving both conventional and digital printing.
