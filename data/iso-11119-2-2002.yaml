abstract:
- content: "ISO 11119-2 specifies requirements for composite gas cylinders up to and
    including 450 litres water capacity, for the storage and conveyance of compressed
    or liquefied gases with test pressures up to and including 650 bar. The cylinders
    are constructed in the form of a seamless metallic liner over-wrapped with carbon
    fibre or aramid fibre or glass fibre (or a mixture thereof) in a resin matrix,
    or steel wire, to provide circumferential reinforcement. \nThis part of ISO 11119
    refers to fully wrapped composite cylinders with a load-sharing liner (i.e. a
    liner that shares the load of the overall cylinder design) and a design life from
    10 a to non-limited life. For cylinders with design life in excess of 15 a, and
    in order for these cylinders to remain in service beyond 15 a, re-qualification
    of these cylinders is recommended.\nThis part of ISO 11119 does not address the
    design, fitting and performance of removable protective sleeves. Where these are
    fitted they should be considered separately."
