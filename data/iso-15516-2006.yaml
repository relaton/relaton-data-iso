    This International Standard specifies the requirements of performances, design, construction, safety,
    maintenance and test of launching appliances for davit-launched lifeboats.
    This International Standard is applicable to launching appliances for davit-launched lifeboats as well as
    launching appliances for davit-launched rescue boats on every kind of sea-going ship, including launching
    appliances for fast rescue boats on ro-ro passenger ships, but is not applicable to launching appliances for
    free-fall lifeboats. This International Standard is also a reference for similar appliances on inland ships.
