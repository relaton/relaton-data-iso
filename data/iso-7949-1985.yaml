abstract:
- content: Specifies both geometrical and practical tests for edge shears for general
    purpose use and normal accuracy, gives the corresponding permissible deviations
    and furthermore the nomenclature appropriate to each part of the machine in English
    and French as well as the equivalent terms in German, Spanish Italian and Swedish.
    It deals only with verification of the accuracy of the machine. It does not apply
    to the testing of the running of the machine or to its characteristics which should
    generally be checked before the accuracy is tested.
