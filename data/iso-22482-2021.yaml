- content: |-
    This document specifies the requirements for factory-made aerogel blankets, which are used for the thermal insulation of building applications. This document specifies insulation that exhibits thermal insulating performance through high porosity and nano-sized pores by compounding aerogel with net-like fibrous material, e.g. polyester, glass fibre, ceramic fibre. The products are delivered as a blanket type.
    This document describes product characteristics and includes procedures for testing, evaluation of conformity and marking and labelling.
    This document does not specify the required level of a given property to be achieved by a product to demonstrate fitness for purpose in a particular application.
