    This document describes necessary but not sufficient safety requirements for the use of SbW systems in passenger cars and light commercial vehicles for series application. This document does not replace the full application of the ISO 26262 series of standards and their implementation in safety-related measures. This document defines requirements for manual driving where the driver holds the steering wheel.
    Note: Misuse of hands-free driving is not considered.
    The document does not contain requirements for the use of automated lateral vehicle control functions. The requirements consider systems consisting of a road wheel actuator, hand wheel actuator and a steering wheel for driver input. Deviating concepts need to be analyzed by the user for transferability.
