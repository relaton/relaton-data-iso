    This document provides the framework guidelines on technologies related to the network-based precise positioning infrastructure for land transportation (NETPPI-LT) that allows land transportation users or objects carrying nomadic devices, equipped with low-cost global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) receivers and wireless communication transceivers, to perform lane-level positioning and integrity monitoring. These technologies will unlock enhanced intelligent transport systems (ITS) services and applications and will increase traffic operation/management efficiencies and traffic safety by reducing economic and social costs from traffic jams, traffic accidents, and environmental pollution.
    The framework described in this document includes:
    —          reference architecture for the NETPPI-LT enabling lane-level positioning and integrity monitoring on personal ITS devices;
    —          guidelines for providing a real-time lane-level positioning service based on GNSS with the aid of the NETPPI-LT;
    —          guidelines to facilitate the practical implementation of the NETPPI-LT for engineers including related use cases.
