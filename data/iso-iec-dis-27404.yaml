abstract:
- content: "This document defines a Universal Cybersecurity Labelling Framework for
    the development and implementation of cybersecurity labelling programmes for consumer
    IoT products and includes guidance on the following topics:\n•\tRisks and threats
    associated with consumer IoT products;\n•\tStakeholders, roles and responsibilities;
    \n•\tRelevant standards and guidance documents;\n•\tConformity assessment options;
    \n•\tLabelling issuance and maintenance requirements; and \n•\tMutual recognition
    considerations.\nThe scope of this document is limited to consumer IoT products,
    such as IoT gateways, base stations and hubs to which multiple devices connect;
    smart cameras, televisions, and speakers; wearable health trackers; connected
    smoke detectors, door locks and window sensors; connected home automation and
    alarm systems, especially their gateways and hubs; connected appliances, such
    as washing machines and fridges; smart home assistants; and connected children's
    toys and baby monitors. \nThe Universal Cybersecurity Labelling Framework addresses
    the expected and intended use of IoT devices and systems by consumers, that is,
    the general public and non-technical users. These devices and systems are used
    with the understanding that the label and criteria are designed for consumer use
    and consumer security concerns. Safety is not addressed in this Universal Cybersecurity
    Labelling Framework even though it is an important aspect to consider. Consumer
    IoT devices used in an enterprise context may not be classified as consumer IoT
    devices due to potentially more serious implications if compromised, which then
    entails more stringent cybersecurity provisions. Furthermore, in threat models
    of consumer IoT, there is no IT/system administrator as a pre-condition.\nProducts
    that are not intended for consumer use are excluded from this standard. Examples
    of excluded devices are those that are primarily intended for manufacturing, healthcare
    and other industrial purposes.\nThe Universal Cybersecurity Labelling Framework
    is based on requirements from international standards, with objectives to facilitate
    mutual recognition of labelling schemes for consumer IoT (regardless if they are
    binary or multi-level), avoid fragmentation of standards, eradicate duplicated
    testing (across countries), reduce the cost of compliance and facilitate market
    access for developers. \nThis document is applicable to consumers, developers,
    issuing bodies of cybersecurity labels and independent test laboratories."
