abstract:
- content: "This document gives general requirements for interpretation and reports
    of multiplex molecular tests using IVD medical devices and laboratory developed
    tests (LDTs), including qualitative/quantitative detection of nucleic acid targets.
    \nThis document is applicable to all the methods that are used for IVD medical
    devices and LDTs that measure two or more nucleic acid targets of interest.   This
    document is intended for multiplex assays that evaluate human nucleic acid targets,
    and detection of microbial pathogens in the background of human genome directly
    from clinical specimens."
