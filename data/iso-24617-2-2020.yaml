abstract:
- content: This document provides a set of empirically and theoretically well-motivated
    concepts for dialogue annotation, a formal language for expressing dialogue annotations
    (the Dialogue Act Markup Language, DiAML), and a method for segmenting a dialogue
    into semantic units. This allows the manual or automatic annotation of dialogue
    segments with information about the communicative actions which the participants
    perform by their contributions to the dialogue. The annotation scheme specified
    in this document supports multidimensional annotation of spoken, written, and
    multimodal dialogues involving two or more participants. Dialogue units are viewed
    as having multiple communicative functions in different dimensions. The markup
    language DiAML has an XML-based representation format and a formal semantics which
    makes it possible to perform inferences with DiAML representations. This document
    also specifies data categories for dimensions of dialogue analysis, for communicative
    functions, for dialogue act qualifiers, and for relations between dialogue acts.
    Additionally, it provides mechanisms for customizing these sets of concepts, extending
    them with application-specific or domain-specific concepts and descriptions of
    semantic content, or selecting relevant coherent subsets of them. These mechanisms
    make the dialogue act concepts specified in this document useful not only for
    annotation but also for the recognition and generation of dialogue acts in interactive
    systems.
