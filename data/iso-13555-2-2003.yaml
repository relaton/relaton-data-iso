abstract:
- content: ISO 13555-2:2002 specifies a test method for referencing the pressure rise
    in the high-pressure pipe of a diesel fuel injection system consisting of fuel
    injection pump, high-pressure pipe or pipes and injector or injectors, as part
    of the procedure for checking the dynamic setting of fuel injection equipment
    fitted to diesel engines (the pressure rise being related to the start of pumping
    of fuel at the fuel injection pump and the start of injection). It is not applicable
    to unit injector systems or common rail systems and, unless otherwise noted by
    the original equipment manufacturer (OEM), might not be applicable to systems
    incorporating line/cylinder disable at idle, fuel injection equipment with electronic
    controls that control timing or systems incorporating pilot or pre-injection features.
    The test method does not cover the setting of diesel fuel injection timing, for
    which reference is to be made to the vehicle, engine or fuel injection manufacturer's
    data or all these.
