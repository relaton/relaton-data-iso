  content: "This document provides an approach that support stakeholders in a supply
    chain to accomplish a chain of trust regarding properties of identifiable material
    goods along a supply chain. This document gives guidance on the identification
    of trust domains and their corresponding trustworthiness attributes, and the measures
    to achieve the targeted trustworthiness attributes.\n\nAs a supply chain comprises
    of several stakeholder and numerous distinct trust domains, this document specifies
    a systematic approach for identification of interaction points between trust domains.
    It defines criteria for ensuring that each interaction is trustworthy and aids
    the establishment of a chain of trust. \n\nThis document introduces a standardized
    data structure to exchange trustworthiness relevant information. This can be used
    to negotiate and exchange trustworthiness properties between different supply
    chain nodes. It will support several properties, such as interoperability, robustness,
    accountability, transparency while preserving privacy. \n\nThis document does
    not interfere with any known standards. Different technologies can be leveraged
    for the implementation of the approaches guided in this document. It can be used
    to support existing systems. This document is technology agnostic, and the aspects
    specified in this document can be implemented using various technologies such
    as PKI certificates, Decentralized Identifiers and Verifiable Credentials."
