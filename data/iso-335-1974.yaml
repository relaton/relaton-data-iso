abstract:
- content: The caking power of a coal is defined by the mechanical strength of the
    crucible coke obtained by carbonization under standard conditions of an intimate
    mixture of 1 g of coal and 5 g of standard anthrazite. The crucible coke obtained
    is then submitted to a drum test in a strictly prescribed manner and the Roga
    Index is calculated from the results.
