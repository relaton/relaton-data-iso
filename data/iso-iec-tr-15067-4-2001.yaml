    Residential security systems are among the most popular applications in a home automation
    system. This model is intended to be generic. It is applicable to a wide variety of security
    functions that extend well-beyond traditional intrusion detection. Potential applications of home
    security as represented in this model include activity monitoring, duress monitoring, and safety
    monitoring of personal well-being.
    The intrusion and safety applications of a security system are similar for commercial buildings.
    This generic model can therefore be extended to commercial building security functions.
