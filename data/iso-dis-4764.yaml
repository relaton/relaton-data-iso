abstract:
- content: This international standard specifies a method for quantifying the total
    unsaturation using an addition reaction of the interhalogen compound ICl (iodine
    monochloride) using glacial acetic acid as a solvent as a method for measuring
    the total unsaturation of a polyether polyol for polyurethanes. It is not applicable
    to unsaturated compounds that are conjugated with a carbonyl group, a carboxyl
    group, or a nitrile group
