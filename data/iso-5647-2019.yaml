    This document specifies a method for determining titanium dioxide content in all kinds of paper and board, in particular coated or filled products. It comprises two procedures for the final determination of titanium, one of them relying on spectrophotometry and the other on flame atomic absorption spectrophotometry. The limits of the determination depend on the amount of sample taken (8.1).
    NOTE       The method is designed for the determination of titanium dioxide. Titanium present in other forms, for example as a constituent of clay, will not interfere in the determination.
