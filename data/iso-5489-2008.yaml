abstract:
- content: ISO 5489:2007 specifies requirements for a ship's embarkation ladder that
    is provided to enable safe embarkation of waterborne survival craft along a vertical
    portion of the ship's hull. It is applicable to merchant ships required to carry
    embarkation ladders under Chapter III of the 1974 International Convention for
    the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS), as amended. National maritime safety administrations
    are urged to accept ladders complying with this International Standard on their
    ships, as complying fully with the requirements of SOLAS.
