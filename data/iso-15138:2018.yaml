abstract:
- content: |-
    This document specifies requirements and provides guidance for the design, testing, installation and commissioning of heating, ventilation, air-conditioning and pressurization systems, and equipment on all offshore production installations for the petroleum and natural gas industries that are
    —          new or existing,
    —          normally occupied by personnel or not normally occupied by personnel, and
    —          fixed or floating but registered as an offshore production installation.
    This document is normally applicable to the overall facilities. For installations that can be subject to "Class" or "IMO/MODU Codes & Resolutions", the user is referred to HVAC requirements under these rules and resolutions. When these requirements are less stringent than those being considered for a fixed installation, then it is necessary that this document, i.e. requirements for fixed installations, be utilized.
