abstract:
- content: "This document establishes requirements for adventure tourism involving
    cyclotourism (e.g. road bike, mountain bike or fatbike), relating to the safety
    of participants, leaders and assistants.\nIn cases of cycle tourism operations
    that involve overnight stays, additional requirements are required, which are
    described in Section 11 of this Document.\nThis document also establishes criteria
    relating to characteristics and difficulty level for cyclotourism route classification.\nThis
    document applies to cyclotourism that are offered as tourism products. Tourism
    product design involves a product planning and development phase that is not subject
    to this document. Some tourism products include cyclotourism together with other
    tourism services (e.g. transfers, meals, lodging), but this document applies only
    to cyclotourism, the additional tourism services being excluded from the scope.
    \nThis document is applicable to any kind of adventure tourism activity provider
    that offers tourism products consisting of cyclotourism.\nThis document is not
    applicable to bicycle rental with no adventure tourism purposes, which attend
    urban or rural mobility needs."
