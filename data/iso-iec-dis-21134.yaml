    This document identifies the reference framework for the benchmarking of integrated indoor localization and tracking methods using dead reckoning in areas of; (1) Datasets and test environments, (2) Benchmark metrics, (3) Benchmarking process and (4) Conformance.
    The main target of the benchmarking framework is integrated indoor localization methods using dead-reckoning, which is assumed to be running on the mobile devices such as smartphones for mixed and augmented reality (MAR).
