abstract:
- content: This document defines a technical solution for encrypting resources in
    digital publications (especially EPUB), effectively registering a device certificate
    to providers and securely delivering decryption keys to reading systems included
    in licenses tailored to specific devices. This technical solution uses the passphrase-based
    authentication method defined in ISO/IEC 23078-2 for reading systems to receive
    the license and access the encrypted resources of such digital publications.
