abstract:
- content: This document specifies the test methods for measurement and determination
    of the compressive strength of sprayed concrete at different age, from young hardened
    to long term hardened sprayed concrete. Initial and early compressive strength
    development of sprayed concrete up to 24h are measured using indirect methods,
    namely needle penetration and pin driving methods. Both methods correlate the
    impact of the compressive strength on the penetration of a needle. The test methods
    could be applied to measure compressive strength of sprayed concrete in the range
    of 0.5MPa to 100MPa. The specimens of hardened sprayed concrete are extracted
    from either an in situ element or a test panel.
