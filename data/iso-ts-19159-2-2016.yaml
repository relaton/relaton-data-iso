    ISO/TS 19159-2:2016 defines the data capture method, the relationships between the coordinate reference systems and their parameters, as well as the calibration of airborne lidar (light detection and ranging) sensors.
    ISO/TS 19159-2:2016 also standardizes the service metadata for the data capture method, the relationships between the coordinate reference systems and their parameters and the calibration procedures of airborne lidar systems as well as the associated data types and code lists that have not been defined in other ISO geographic information international standards.
