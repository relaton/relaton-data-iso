    This document specifies an acceptable security framework for the issuance and management of digital currencies using cryptographic mechanisms standardized by ISO/TC 68/SC 2 and other references.
    This document proposes a framework approach based on standards for mitigating vulnerabilities for digital currency systems. The objective is that security aspects are integrated by design and not added afterwards as an extra processing layer that needs to accommodate legacy infrastructures.
