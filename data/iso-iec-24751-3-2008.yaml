  content: "ISO/IEC 24751-3:2008 provides a common language for describing digital
    learning resources to facilitate matching of those resources to learners' accessibility
    needs and preferences (as defined in  ISO/IEC 24751-2). This description is one
    side of a pair of descriptions used in matching user needs and preferences with
    education delivery (as described in  ISO/IEC 24751-1).\nISO/IEC 24751-3:2008 discusses
    the basic principles adhered to in developing this model for describing digital
    learning resources. It explains: the assumptions made in developing ISO/IEC 24751-3:2008,
    the notion of an original and adapted resource, the major categories of metadata
    for original and adapted resources, the notion of an access mode for a resource,
    what is meant by adaptability, and the importance of interoperability and the
    role played by consistent implementation in interoperability. \nIt contains the
    information model for ISO/IEC 24751-3, including the attribute, allowed occurrence
    and datatype of each element. \nIt defines and describes how the terms in the
    information model should be used, and explains how ISO/IEC 24751-3:2008 can be
    extended. \nIt discusses conformance to ISO/IEC 24751-3. Conformance is dependent
    on the role played by the conformant technology. Conformance requirements for
    both education delivery applications, resources and metadata authoring tools are
    explained. \nISO/IEC 24751-3:2008 provides\n- a consolidated list of all the terms
    defined in ISO/IEC 24751-3:2008, sorted in French alphabetical order, \n- the
    ISO French language equivalent terms and definitions, and\n- the codes representing
    the gender of the French terms. \nThe vocabulary codes, values and associated
    rules of application are defined. An informative list of recommended default values
    for the learner preferences and needs is provided.\nIt lists existing bindings
    of the IMS Access for All Metadata Specification Version 1 (ACCMD) that serves
    as the reference specification for ISO/IEC 24751-3:2008.\nIt describes information
    scenarios for applying ISO/IEC 24751-3:2008 and gives informative implementation
    examples. \nUse of ISO/IEC 24751-3:2008 will assist in matching individual learner
    needs in a computer-mediated learning environment with the necessary user interface
    and resources needed to meet those needs. "
