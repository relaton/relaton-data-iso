  content: "ISO/TR 11583:2012 describes the measurement of wet gas with differential
    pressure meters. It applies to two-phase flows of gas and liquid in which the
    flowing fluid mixture consist of gas in the region of 95 % volume fraction or
    more. ISO/TR 11583:2012 is an extension of ISO 5167. The ranges of gases and liquids
    from which the equations in ISO/TR 11583:2012 were derived are given. It is possible
    that the equations do not apply to liquids significantly different from those
    tested, particularly to highly viscous liquids.\nAlthough the over-reading equations
    presented in ISO/TR 11583:2012 apply for a wide range of gases and liquids at
    appropriate gas-liquid density ratios, evaluating gas flow rates depends on information
    in addition to that required in single-phase flow: a measurement of the pressure
    loss can be sufficient; measurement of the liquid flow using tracers can be possible;
    the total mass flow rate may be known (this is more likely in a wet-steam flow
    than in a natural gas/liquid flow); in a wet-steam flow a throttling calorimeter
    can be used. \nWet-gas measurement using Venturi tubes or orifice plates is covered
    in ISO/TR 11583:2012."
