    This document provides guidelines for the planning, design and construction of a cylindrical tank constructed on the ground with prestressed concrete (PC) for use with potable water tank.
    This document is applicable to PC tanks for potable water with a capacity of 30 000 m3 or less and the diameter-to-height ratio (D/H) from 1,0 to 3,0.
    NOTE       When designing and constructing a tank not covered by this document (reinforced concrete tanks, underground tanks, elevated tanks, etc.), a designer can refer to this document for common elements where possible.
