    This document specifies the requirements for testing the performances of coal density separators using density tracers and provides a method for the presentation of test results.
    This document is partly based on AS 5213.
    This document is applicable to dense medium cyclones (DMCs) and dense medium baths, as follows:
    a)    for a single separator;
    b)    for a group of separators where the feed is distributed between them at a point downstream of density tracer insertion;
    c)    for density tracers of any size; but rarely used for particles with maximum dimension less than 2 mm.
    This document also provides guidance for testing the performances of other types of density separators with density tracers.
