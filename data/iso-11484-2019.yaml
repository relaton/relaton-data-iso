    This document specifies an employer's qualification system for non-destructive testing (NDT) personnel performing the testing of the following steel products under the employer's responsibility:
    a)    tubes/pipes (seamless or welded);
    b)    flat products, long products, rails, bars, sections, rods and wires.
    This document specifies qualification requirements for the competence of Level 1 and Level 2 NDT personnel to execute specific tasks in the NDT of steel products. The qualification is issued by the employer for a specific steel product and a specific test method.
    This document is applicable to NDT personnel performing predominantly the automated testing of steel products, using any of the following NDT methods:
    a)    eddy current testing (ET);
    b)    leak testing (LT);
    c)    liquid penetrant testing (PT);
    d)    magnetic testing (MT);
    e)    radiographic testing (RT);
    f)     ultrasonic testing (UT);
    g)    visual testing (VT).
