  content: "The ISO/IEC 30105 series specifies the lifecycle process requirements
    performed by the IT enabled business process outsourcing service provider for
    the outsourced business processes. It defines the processes to plan, establish,
    implement, operate, monitor, review, maintain and improve its services. \nThis
    document specifies the process reference model (PRM). It contains process definitions
    across the lifecycle described in terms of process context, purpose and outcomes,
    together with a framework defining relationships between the processes.\nThe process
    purpose details the high-level objective of performing the process such that implementation
    of the process leads to tangible benefits for stakeholders. The process outcomes
    are clearly defined by observable results and aligned to the business benefits
    derived by the customer and service provider.\nThis document:\n—     covers IT
    enabled business processes that are outsourced;\n—     is not intended to address
    IT processes, but includes references to them at key touchpoints for completeness;\n—    
    is applicable to the service provider, not to the customer;\n—     is applicable
    to all lifecycle processes of ITES-BPO;\n—     serves as a PRM for organizations
    providing ITES-BPO services."
