    ISO/IEC 15459-1:2014 specifies a unique string of characters for the identification of individual transport units. The character string is intended to be represented in a bar code label or other AIDC media attached to the entity to meet management needs. To address management needs, different types of entities are recognized in the various parts of ISO/IEC 15459, which allows different requirements to be met by the identities associated with each type.
    The rules for the unique identification for individual transport units, to identify physical logistical transfers, with the identity relevant for the duration of one or more items in the load being held or transported as part of that load, are defined and supported by example.
