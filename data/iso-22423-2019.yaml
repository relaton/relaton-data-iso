abstract:
- content: This document specifies the method for comparing performance evaluation
    results for a foil thrust bearing that supports load with aerodynamic force generated
    by the rotation of a driving shaft and lubricates using air, not lubricating oil.
    The test procedure explained in this document measures and evaluates the static
    load capacity, bearing torque, friction coefficient and lifetime of the foil thrust
    bearing and compares the test results to those for different test conditions.
    The measured static load capacity can be varied depending on the capabilities
    of the test device used.
