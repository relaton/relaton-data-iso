abstract:
- content: |-
    This document defines quality measures for quantitatively evaluating cloud services quality in terms of characteristics and sub-characteristics defined in ISO/IEC TS 25052-1 and is intended to be used together with ISO/IEC TS 25052-1.
    This document contains the following:
    —     a basic set of quality measures for each characteristic and sub-characteristics;
    —     an explanation of how to apply quality measures to cloud services.
    Since the quality model defined in ISO/IEC TS 25052-1 is the extension to the existing quality models defined in ISO/IEC 25010 to ISO/IEC 25019, it can be used with the product quality model, IT service quality model, data quality model, and quality-in-use model according to evaluation purposes. For the same reason, the quality measures defined in this document can also be used with the quality measures for software ICT products, IT services, data, and quality-in-use.
    As there are several cloud service categories, this document focuses on the quality model of SaaS (software as a service). This document does not address PaaS (platform as a service) and IaaS (infrastructure as a service).
