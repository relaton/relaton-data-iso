    This document specifies the application module for AP239 product life cycle support.
    The following are within the scope of this document:
    - information for defining a complex product and its support solution;
    - information required to maintain a complex product;
    - information required for through life configuration change management of a product and its support solution;
    - the representation of product structures, assemblies and breakdowns including:

    the identification and representation of parts, their versions, definitions, and documentation and management information, such as dates and approvals assigned to parts;
    the representation of multiple product structure views;
    the representation of functional, physical, system and zonal breakdown of the product structure, from system via subsystems or components to end items;
    the representation of the shape of an assembly as the composition of the shape representation of its components;
    the identification of positions within an assembly of parts to which component parts may be attached;
    the association of valued properties to a part or to an assembly;
    the representation of interfaces between products;
    the classification of parts, documents and assemblies.


    - the representation of a product through life including:

    the representation of product requirements and their fulfilment;
    the representation of existing or potential future products;
    the identification of the configuration of a product for a given role;
    the specification of effectivity constraints applied to configuration of a product;
    the representation of predicted and observed states of products.


    - the specification and planning of activities for a product including:

    the specification of tasks to be performed on a product;
    the representation of conditions for performing the tasks, including the resources required and the location of the resources and product;
    the representation of the type of person and skills required for performing a task;
    the representation of planning and scheduling of the tasks and the management and authorization of the subsequent work.


    - the representation of the activity history of a product including:

    the recording of the usage of a product and the resource usage;
    the recording of the activities performed on a product and the resource usage.


    - the representation of the product history including:

    a historical record of the states of a product;
    a historical record of the configuration status of the product;
    the location of product data;
    the observation of product data.
