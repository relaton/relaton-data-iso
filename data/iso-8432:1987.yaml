abstract:
- content: Liquid chromatography is a method of separation based on the phenomena
    of adsorption, partition, ion exchange and/or exclusion. It enables a small quantity
    of aromatic essential oil or other raw materials for the perfume industry to be
    analysed on a chromatographic column with an appropriate packing and under appropriate
    conditions, the possible identification of the different constituent and the quantitative
    determination of specific compounds by measuring the area or height of their peaks.
    Details of the method are described.
