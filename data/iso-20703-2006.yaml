    ISO 20703:2006 specifies minimum requirements for the material, design, construction and workmanship, manufacturing processes and tests at manufacture of refillable, transportable, welded aluminium-alloy gas cylinders of water capacities from 0,5 l up to and including 150 l, and of a test pressure not greater than 60 bar (6 MPa) for compressed, liquefied and dissolved gases.
    It includes requirements for spherical receptacles and cylinders made from seamless bodies with welded non-pressure-bearing attachments such as shrouds and foot-rings.
