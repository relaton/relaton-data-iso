- content: |-
    ISO 16311-2:2014 describes general requirements and procedures for the assessment of concrete structures.
    The assessment can be initiated under the following circumstances, but not limited to: a) an anticipated change in use or extension of design service life; b) structural deterioration due to time-dependent actions such as corrosion of reinforcement, fatigue, etc.; c) safety and/or serviceability check (e.g. for earthquake and increased traffic actions) as required by authorities, insurance companies, owners, etc.; d) structural damage by accidental actions. (See ISO 2394.)
    This part of ISO 16311 does not cover      qualification of personnel, contractual matters, and health and safety requirements for the protection of workers during the investigation and testing.
