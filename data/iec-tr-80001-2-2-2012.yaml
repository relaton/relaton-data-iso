abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: IEC/TR 80001-2-2:2012(E), which is a technical report, creates a framework
    for the disclosure of security-related capabilities and risks necessary for managing
    the risk in connecting medical devices to IT-networks and for the security dialog
    that surrounds the IEC 80001-1 risk management of IT-network connection. This
    security report presents an informative set of common, high-level security-related
    capabilities useful in understanding the user needs, the type of security controls
    to be considered and the risks that lead to the controls. Intended use and local
    factors determine which exact capabilities will be useful in the dialog about
    risk. The capability descriptions in this report are intended to supply health
    delivery organizations (HDOs), medical device manufacturers (MDMs), and IT vendors
    with a basis for discussing risk and their respective roles and responsibilities
    toward its management. This discussion among the risk partners serves as the basis
    for one or more responsibility agreements as specified in IEC 80001-1.
