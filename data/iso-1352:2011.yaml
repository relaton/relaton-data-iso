abstract:
- content: "ISO 1352:2011 specifies the conditions for performing torsional, constant-amplitude,
    nominally elastic stress fatigue tests on metallic specimens without deliberately
    introducing stress concentrations. The tests are carried out at ambient temperature
    (ideally at between 10 °C and 35 °C) in air by applying a pure couple to the specimen
    about its longitudinal axis. \nWhile the form, preparation and testing of specimens
    of circular cross-section and tubular cross-section are described in ISO 1352:2011,
    component and other specialized types of testing are not included. Similarly,
    low-cycle torsional fatigue tests carried out under constant-amplitude angular
    displacement control, which lead to failure in a few thousand cycles, are also
    excluded."
