    ISO 1953:2015 specifies reference methods for the size analysis of coal by manual sieving (wet or dry), using test sieves of aperture sizes between 125 mm and 45 μm. A guide to sampling is given in Annex A.
    This International Standard is applicable to all hard coals. It is not applicable to coke or other manufactured fuels.
    In the case of pulverized coal which has been ground so that a high proportion passes through the test sieve of smallest aperture size, the methods described in this International Standard will determine only the percentage oversize.
