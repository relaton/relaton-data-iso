    ISO 16699:2015 focuses on disposal of launch vehicle stages used during launch of spacecraft to be operated in space where the orbital launch stages are left in orbit after the spacecraft are released.
    End-of-mission disposal of launch vehicle orbital stages broadly means removing the stages from the protected regions of space (see ISO 24113) so as not to collide or otherwise interfere with the other users of those protected regions in the future. ISO 24113 also requires that "During the disposal phase, a spacecraft or launch vehicle orbital stage shall permanently deplete or make safe all remaining on-board sources of stored energy in a controlled sequence." These "passivation" actions are typically either accomplished in the course of disposal, or immediately follow the disposal operations. In this document, the term "disposal actions" refers to both disposal manoeuvres and to passivation actions (note: passivation actions are not required after the final manoeuvre leading to a controlled re-entry).
    ISO 24113 provides six options for spacecraft or orbital launch stage disposal. This International Standard specifies techniques for planning and executing disposal of orbital launch stages that are consistent with ISO 24113 requirements, reflect current internationally accepted guidelines, and consider current operational procedures and best practices.
