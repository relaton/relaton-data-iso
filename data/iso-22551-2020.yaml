    This document establishes a test method for determining the antibacterial activity of materials containing an indoor-light-active photocatalytic material on the surface. The antibacterial reduction rate is determined by measuring the survival of bacteria after illumination with indoor light. This test assumes a surface with high potential of possible person contact with bacteria. This test is designed to evaluate the suppression of contact infection of bacteria using an indoor-light-active photocatalytic material under indoor lighting environment.
    It is intended for use with different kinds of indoor-light-active photocatalytic materials used in construction, for example, flat sheets, board or plate shapes, which are the basic forms of materials for various applications. It is not applicable to powder, granular, or porous indoor-light-active photocatalytic materials, as well as cloths or textiles.
    It is applicable to indoor-light-active photocatalytic materials produced for antibacterial application. Other types of indoor-light-active photocatalytic materials applications, i.e. decomposition of water contaminants, self-cleaning, antifogging, and air purification, are non-applicable by this method.
