    A Private Integrated Service Network (PISN) is a network comprising either one PINX or more than
    one PINX interconnected by Inter-PINX connections. This Technical Report is concerned with inter-
    PINX connections (IPC) that are provided by Intervening Networks (IVN), and the way in which these
    are handled by PINXs to provide a platform for inter-PINX communication. Different types of IVNs
    can be used to provide IPCs, in accordance with the scenarios indicated in ISO/IEC 11579-1. These
    are Overlay Scenarios in that they enable the services of the PISN to operate transparently across
    an IVN.
    Connected PINXs need to co-ordinate their use of IVNs, and appropriate standardisation is needed
    to allow networks to be created employing PINXs and IVNs from multiple vendors. The following
    points need to be considered:
    _ In general but depending on the type of IVN, procedures and signalling protocols between the
    PINXs are needed for the establishment, maintenance and release of IPCs. Appropriate
    standardisation of these procedures and signalling protocols is necessary.
    _ At the Q reference point (a conceptual point within a PINX) channels and PISN call control
    signalling (QSIG) are defined independently of the type of IVN. However, at the C reference
    point (where the PINX is connected to the IVN), the representation of the channels and of
    signalling is dependent on the type of IVN, and on how the PINXs use the IPCs. Appropriate
    standardisation of these aspects at the C reference point is necessary.
    _ In general the relationship between a channel at the Q reference point and its representation at
    the C reference point is not static, and procedures and signalling between the PINXs are needed
    for the co-ordination of these relationships. Appropriate standardisation of these procedures and
    signalling is necessary.
    _ Appropriate mechanisms need to be standardised for conveying inter-PINX signalling through
    the IVN. These will depend on the characteristics of the IPC used.
    The aim of this Technical Report is to identify:
    1. In addition to PISN call control signalling (QSIG), what needs to be standardised, in order to be
    able to inter-connect PINXs;
    2. General techniques, procedures, protocols etc., that apply to of all (or at least very many) types
    of IVNs.
