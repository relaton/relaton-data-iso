    This document provides a uniform basis for determining the exposure times for all types of shutters used in still cameras and contains suitable definitions of the terms used.
    It specifies the exposure-time markings for all types of shutters and their tolerances.
    The characteristics of all types of mechanical shutters, which are mounted in still cameras and affect the control of exposure, motion-stopping ability and synchronization with a photoflash light source are also defined.
    The tolerances specified are the target values for the shutter performance that can be expected to give good results. They are not intended for application as a general inspection standard in controlling the performance of mechanical shutters, since tolerances may vary with the feature and price class of camera tested.
    Test methods are described for routine manufacturing testing and quality control. These test methods require access to the focal plane of the camera and can therefore not be applied to assembled digital still cameras.
