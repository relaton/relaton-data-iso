abstract:
- content: "This standard defines a methodology to evaluate the test scenarios and
    provides a procedure extending test scenarios to test cases for a given function
    in a traceable way based on the testability. This standard also defines necessary
    characteristics of a test case that include but not limited to test initialization,
    test stimulation, test steps, pass/fail-criteria and expected results etc. \nThis
    standard describes evaluation methods and criteria that include but not limited
    to the relation between the test case, real world as well as databases/information-sources,
    e.g. frequency, criticality, complexity, and the relation between the test scenario
    and the tested function, e.g. coverage of ODD.  \nThe contents are intended to
    be applied to Level 3 and higher ADS defined in ISO/SAE 22736."
