abstract:
- content: "ISO 21217:2010 specifies the architectural communications framework of
    “Intelligent Transport Systems” (ITS) for the family of CALM-related International
    Standards. The architecture is described in an abstract way with several graphical
    views and examples. The graphical representations partly follow the ISO Open Systems
    Interconnection (OSI) principles. In addition to the requirements specified within
    ISO 21217:2010 a number of notes and examples are provided to illustrate the CALM
    concept. \nWherever practicable, ISO 21217:2010 has been developed by reference
    to suitable extant International Standards, adopted by selection. The architecture
    provides for regional variations where regulations differ in different countries
    and regions."
