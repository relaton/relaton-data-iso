    ISO/TS 18344:2016 defines test methods and minimum requirements for paper deacidification processes regarding their effectiveness and consistency.
    It is applicable for all large scale processes which offer deacidification of acid documents made of printed or hand-written paper.
    Possible negative side effects of deacidification processes on the treated objects are not the subject of this Technical Specification. However, some general recommendations for how to cope with these side effects are given in Annex A.
    It is not specified either, which types of paper objects can be treated by large scale deacidification methods. Whatever currently available deacidification method is used, some objects might be excluded from treatment to avoid mechanical damage to paper and bindings or other unwanted side effects. The provider of the deacidification treatment should inform the customer about the limitations of the chosen method.
