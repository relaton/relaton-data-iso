    This document specifies principles, requirements and methods for the installation of public information guidance systems. It also provides guidelines on the assessments of the outcomes of public information guidance systems.
    It is intended for use by organizations providing design and installation services in the field of public information guidance systems and organizations selecting, using or developing relative assessments.
    This document is applicable to the installation and assessment of public information guidance systems used in public places, such as bus and railway stations, airports, shopping centres, shops, hospitals, exhibition halls, sports and entertainment complexes, urban areas, parks, gardens and countryside, public attractions, museums and commercial office buildings.
    This document is not applicable to:
    —     variable message signs (e.g. dynamic message signs, matrix signs and electronic traffic displays);
    —     sectors (e.g. traffic signs on a public highway) which are subject to specific regulations or specified installation principles; however, in a given public environment or within a wayfinding and signing design brief, public information sometimes needs to be associated with other messaging, so many of the principles contained in this document can be relevant in the planning of a coordinated scheme.
