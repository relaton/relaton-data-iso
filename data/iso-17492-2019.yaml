    This document specifies a test method for measuring the heat transferred through horizontally mounted flame-resistant textile materials when exposed to a combination of convective and radiant heat. The exposure conditions are adjusted to be approximately a 50/50 mixture of pure convective heat and pure radiant heat. The total exposure heat flux is 84 kW/m2.
    This test method is applicable to any type of sheet material used either as a single layer or in a multilayer construction when all structures or sub-assemblies are made of flame-resistant materials. It does not apply to materials that are not flame resistant.
    This test method does not apply to the evaluation of materials exposed to any other type of thermal energy sources, such as radiant heat only or flame contact only. ISO 6942 is applicable when evaluating materials for exposure to radiant heat only. ISO 9151 is applicable when evaluating materials due to flame contact only.
    NOTE       Some, but not all, textiles materials can ignite and continue to burn after exposure to the convective and radiant heat produced by this test method.
