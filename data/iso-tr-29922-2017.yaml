    ISO/TR 29922:2017 acts as a repository for those manifold technical details which justify and explain the methods presented in the third edition of ISO 6976 but which are not directly needed in the everyday routine implementation of the standard.
    Each main clause addresses a specific aspect of the calculational method described in ISO 6976:2016, and is intended to be self-sufficient and essentially independent of each other clause. For this reason, the user should not expect the whole to be accessible to study as a sequentially coherent narrative.
