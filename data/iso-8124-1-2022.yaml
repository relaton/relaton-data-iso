    The requirements in this document apply to all toys, i.e. any product designed or clearly intended for use in play by children under 14 years of age. They are applicable to a toy as it is initially received by the consumer and, in addition, they apply after a toy is subjected to reasonably foreseeable conditions of normal use and abuse unless specifically noted otherwise.
    The requirements of this document specify acceptable criteria for structural characteristics of toys, such as shape, size, contour, spacing (e.g. rattles, small parts, sharp points and edges, and hinge-line clearances) as well as acceptable criteria for properties peculiar to certain categories of toy (e.g. maximum kinetic energy values for non-resilient-tipped projectiles and minimum tip angles for certain ride-on toys).
    This document specifies requirements and test methods for toys intended for use by children in various age groups from birth to 14 years. The requirements vary according to the age group for which a particular toy is intended. The requirements for a particular age group reflect the nature of the hazards and the expected mental and/or physical abilities of a child to cope with them.
    This document also requires that appropriate warnings and/or instructions for use be given on certain toys or their packaging. Due to linguistic problems which may occur in different countries, the wording of these warnings and instructions is not specified but given as general information in Annex B. It should be noted that different legal requirements exist in many countries with regard to such marking.
    This document does not purport to cover or include every conceivable potential hazard of a particular toy or toy category. Except for labelling requirements indicating the functional hazards and the age range for which the toy is intended, this document has no requirements for those characteristics of toys which represent an inherent and recognized hazard which is integral to the function of the toy.
    EXAMPLE 1   An example of such a hazard is the sharp point necessary for the proper function of a needle. The needle is a hazard which is well understood by the purchaser of a toy sewing kit, and the functional sharp-point hazard is communicated to the user as part of the normal educational process of learning to sew as well as at the point of purchase by means of cautionary labelling on the product's packaging.
    EXAMPLE 2   As a further example, a two-wheeled toy scooter has inherent and recognized hazards associated with its use (e.g. instability during use, especially while learning). The potential hazards associated with its structural characteristics (e.g. sharp edges, pinch hazards) will be minimized by conformity to the requirements of this document.
    Products not included within the scope of this document are:
    a) bicycles, except for those considered to be toys, i.e. those having a maximum saddle height of 435 mm (see 1);
    b) slingshots;
    NOTE 1   “Slingshots” are also known as “catapults” and are usually held in the hand; examples are given in Figure 1. Toy versions of medieval catapults and trebuchets are not exempt from this document; an example is given in Figure 2.
    c) darts with metal points;
    d) public playground equipment;
    e) compressed air- and gas-operated guns and pistols (see 1);
    f) kites (except for the electric resistance of their strings, which is included);
    g) model kits, hobby and craft items, in which the finished item is not primarily of play value;
    h) sporting goods and equipment, camping goods, athletic equipment, musical instruments and furniture; however, toys which are their counterparts are included;
    NOTE 2   It is recognized that there is often a fine distinction between, for example, a musical instrument or a sporting item and its toy counterpart. The intention of the manufacturer or distributor, as well as normal use and reasonably foreseeable abuse, determines whether the item is a toy counterpart or not.
    i) models of aircraft, rockets, boats and land vehicles powered by combustion engines; however, toys which are their counterparts are included (see 1);
    j) collectible products not intended for children under 14 years of age;
    k) holiday decorations that are primarily intended for ornamental purposes;
    l) aquatic equipment intended to be used in deep water;
    m) swimming-learning devices and flotation aids for children, such as swim-seats and swim-aids;
    n) toys installed in public places (e.g. arcades and shopping centres);
    o) puzzles for specialists, for example those with more than 500 pieces and those without a picture;
    p) fireworks, including percussion caps, except percussion caps specifically designed for toys;
    q) products containing heating elements intended for use under the supervision of an adult in a teaching context;
    r) steam engines;
    s) video toys that can be connected to a video screen and operated at a nominal voltage greater than 24 V;
    t) babies' pacifiers (dummies);
    u) faithful reproductions of firearms;
    v) electric ovens, irons or other functional products operated at a nominal voltage greater than 24 V;
    w) bows for archery with an overall relaxed length exceeding 120 cm;
    x) fashion jewellery for children (see 1).
