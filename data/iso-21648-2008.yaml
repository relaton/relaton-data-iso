    ISO 21648:2008 establishes the design, analysis, material selection and characterization, fabrication, test and inspection of the flywheel module (FM) in a flywheel used for energy storage in space systems. These requirements, when implemented on a flywheel module, will ensure a high level of confidence in achieving safe operation and mission success. With appropriate modifications, ISO 21648:2008 can also be applied to similar devices, such as momentum and reaction wheels and control-moment gyroscopes.
    The requirements set forth in ISO 21648:2008 are the minimum requirements for flywheel modules in flywheels used in space flight applications. They are specifically applicable to the parts in the flywheel rotor assembly (FRA), including rim, hub and/or shaft and other associated rotating parts, such as the bearings and the motor generator rotor. The requirements are also relevant to the non-rotating parts, such as module housing, main suspension assembly (magnetic or rolling element bearings, superconductor bearings, etc.), motor stator, caging mechanism and sensors within the module housing, and backup bearings, if applicable. However, control and interface electronics are not covered in ISO 21648:2008.
