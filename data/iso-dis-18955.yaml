- content: "This international standard applies to suspension diaphragms designed
    to be fitted on railway vehicles and similar vehicles running on dedicated tracks
    with permanent guide systems, whatever the type of rail and the running surface.
    \nThis international standard does not detail other components of pneumatic suspension
    assemblies or control systems such as air reservoirs, frames, stiffeners, emergency
    suspension systems or elastic supports (such as series springs), etc., which will
    affect the diaphragm performance. \nThe international standard specifies terms
    and definitions,symbols and abbreviated terms, conditions of use, definition of
    the product, inspection and test methods, marking, definition documents, traceability,
    qualification and quality surveillance, inspection and quality surveillance."
