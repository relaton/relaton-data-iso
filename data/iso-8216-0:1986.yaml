  content: Establishes the general classification system which applies to fuels designated
    by the prefix letter F. Within this class 5 families of products are defined according
    to the type of fuel. The detailed classification of a family taking into account
    complementary elements according to the uses, type and properties will define
    particular products in each category and will be given in subsequent parts of
    ISO 8216 as the need arises.
