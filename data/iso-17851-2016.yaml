  content: "ISO 17851:2016 provides a general description of the whole set of space
    environment components which affect spacecrafts in various outer space regions,
    and the physical and chemical processes causing material degradation in a space
    environment, including synergistic effects. This International Standard defines
    the most important general principles and criteria of space environment simulation
    during material tests, and formulates the general requirements to laboratory test
    facilities and to physical and mathematical models that are applied to the research
    of the space environment impact on materials. The basic purpose of this International
    Standard is to\n-      provide a general description of the methodology in selecting
    a set of space environment components and their characteristics during spacecraft
    material tests, and \n-      determine general principles and criteria for the
    tests.\nAdditionally, such methodology will help in the understanding of the degree
    of coverage of space materials tests with existing International Standards on
    the specific test types, and help define the actual directions in developing new
    International Standards.\nISO 17851:2016 can be applied as a reference document
    in designing spacecrafts, forecasting spacecraft lifetime, conducting ground-based
    tests, and analyzing changes in material properties during operation."
