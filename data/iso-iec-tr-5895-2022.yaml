    This document clarifies and increases the application and implementation of ISO/IEC 30111 and ISO/IEC 29147 in multi-party coordinated vulnerability disclosure (MPCVD) settings, including the evolving commonly adopted practices in this area, by articulating:
    —    The MPCVD life cycle and application of coordinated vulnerability disclosure (CVD) stages (preparation, receipt, verification, remediation[1] development, release, post-release) in MPCVD settings.
    —    Stakeholders involved in MPCVD include users, vendors (coordinating, mitigating, and dependent vendors), reporters, and non-vendor coordinators (entities defined in ISO/IEC 29147 and ISO/IEC 30111).
    —    The exchange of information between stakeholders during the vulnerability handling and disclosure process in a MPCVD settings.
    Clarifying the application of ISO/IEC 30111 and ISO/IEC 29147 in MPCVD settings illustrates the benefits of vulnerability disclosure processes.
     
    [1] Remediation is a defined term used in ISO/IEC 30111 and ISO/IEC 29147. This document uses the term "remediation" and verb “remediate” in the context of this definition.
