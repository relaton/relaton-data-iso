  content: The specified dimensions are confined to those which derive from anthropometric
    data; compliance with them ensures that the furniture permits good seating postures.

    given in tables 1 and 2, and the references to the dimensions are shown in figures
    1 and 2. This standard does not include special requirements applicable to "special
    schools" and adjustable furniture.
