    This document specifies the characteristics of synchronous endless belts and their related pulleys for use in automotive applications such as engine camshaft drives.
    The characteristics include:
    —          belt pitch spacing;
    —          belt nominal tooth dimensions;
    —          belt width and width tolerance;
    —          belt pitch length and pitch length tolerance;
    —          pulley groove dimensions and tolerances;
    —          pulley tolerances and quality specifications.
    Test methods for measuring belt pitch length and lateral runout are also included.
