    This document specifies general requirements, the installation and the activation of the gas supply system of inflatable buoyancy support systems, which serve residual buoyancy for damaged ships not to sink or capsize, and which can be installed in machinery spaces and/or cargo holds.
    It is intended to ensure the functions of the gas supply system, which uses a gas media, such as an asphyxiant, to inflate the buoyancy chamber of the inflatable buoyancy support systems.
