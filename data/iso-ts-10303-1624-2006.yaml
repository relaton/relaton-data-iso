  content: "ISO/TS 10303-1624:2006 specifies the application module for AP210 package
    functional and physical characterization. \nISO/TS 10303-1624:2006 deals with
    the representation of functional and physical characterization data for items
    used as containers or encapsulant for electrical components. ISO/TS 10303-1624:2006
    includes the following information:\n- lead form classification support,\n- predefined
    feature classification,\n- material identification,\n- environmental constraints,\n-
    performance data, and\n- simulation models. \nFormal encapsulation of external
    data type definitions is made for parametric data and analysis models. Terminal
    identification is provided to ensure consistency between 2D and 3D geometric models.
    Package body material is included. Terminals may have core and surface materials.
    Terminals may be separate from or integral to the package body surface. \nShape,
    material, technology, tolerance on shape and on parameters, and units are included.
    \nExtensive support for orientation synchronization between enterprises and between
    2D and 3D representations is provided. \nShapes included may be categorized according
    to discipline (e.g, thermal analysis, vibration analysis), and analysis environment
    (e.g., assembly, end-user). Geometric dimensioning and tolerancing is included.
    \nComplex packages may be treated by the design owner as an interconnect product
    while publishing the information in package as the customer view as in an interface
    control document but as a model. Formal reference information to a defining document
    is provided. \nConfiguration management information and design change management
    information is provided. \nThis data includes at least one geometric representation.
    \nThe following are within the scope of ISO/TS 10303-1624:2006: \n- package physical
    characterization; \n- package geometric functional characterization; \n- package
    terminal functional characterization; \n- package body geometrical characterization;
    \n- package body material characterization; \n- package terminal material characterization;
    \n- mapping to package simulation model for mechanical analysis."
