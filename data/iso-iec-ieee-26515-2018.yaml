    This document supports the interest of information developers and associated roles responsible for producing information for users of software and systems developed within an agile environment. This document takes a process standard approach to specify the way in which information for users can be developed in agile development projects.
    This document provides requirements of information management and information development processes appropriate for software projects that are using agile development methods.
    Clause 5 covers the overall requirements for information in agile software development.
    Clause 6 covers requirements for the information development lead or project manager to plan an agile information development project and manage the information development activities in an agile environment.
    Clause 7 covers requirements for designing, developing, and providing information for users in an agile environment.
    Annex A describes agile development practices and methods.
    This document is intended neither to encourage nor to discourage the use of any particular agile development tools or methods.
    This document provides guidance on processes appropriate for information developers of information for users in software and systems projects that are using agile development methodologies. It is not limited to the development phase of the life cycle of information for users, but includes activities throughout the whole life cycle.
    This document is intended for use in all organizations that are using agile development or are considering implementing their projects using these techniques. It is assumed that users of this document have experience or general knowledge of information for users (traditionally called "user documentation") and agile processes.
