abstract:
- content: 'ISO 16781:2013 provides guidance to control system engineers on what to
    simulate and how to use simulation to support their system engineering tasks.
    ISO 16781:2013 provides simulation requirements of control system for different
    phases in the process of designing a control system. Control system engineers
    can carry out various types of simulation experiments during various phases, according
    to ISO 16781:2013. ISO 16781:2013 establishes a minimum set of requirements for
    simulation of control system. The requirements are generic in nature because of
    their broad applicability to all types of simulations. '
