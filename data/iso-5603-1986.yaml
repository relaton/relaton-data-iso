abstract:
- content: Two methods are given which are applicable primarily to test pieces prepared
    in the laboratory under standard conditions, such as may be used for the development
    and control of materials and processes used in the manufacture of products reinforced
    with wire cord. Test pieces of cord and rubber are prepared together by vulcanizing
    them under pressure. In method 1 the exterior surface of the rubber is suitably
    reinforced. In method 2 such reinforcement is not employed.
