  content: This document establishes common terms, definitions and symbols associated
    with geometrical product specifications (GPS) for use in rolling bearing documents.
    This document gives requirements and recommendations to transform GPS specifications
    into figures and tables in standards published under the direct responsibility
    of ISO/TC 4. The common uniform representation of GPS is essential to avoid different
    interpretations amongst ISO/TC 4 standards. This document includes basic rules
    for the uniform representation of ISO/TC 4 symbols, tolerance values, limits of
    size, deviation limits and limit values derived from GPS indications according
    to e.g. ISO 1101, ISO 1302 and ISO 14405 1, i.e. as indicated on technical drawings.
