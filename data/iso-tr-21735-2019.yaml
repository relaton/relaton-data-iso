    This document defines framework architecture for plug and play (PnP) vehicles and identifies the issues related to exchanging information between occupants (users) and PnP vehicles with nomadic devices. The purpose of architecture is to enhance PnP vehicles and the occupants' safety state by exchanging the information/availability from PnP vehicles and occupants' information/status.
    The function of frame architecture is to define message follows and its effect on safety state between a PnP vehicle and the occupants. This document specifies the framework of safety state representation between the PnP vehicle and the occupants. The state of the PnP vehicle depending on the PnP vehicle's equipment informs the occupants, and the status of the occupants is also transmitted to the PnP vehicle where status information is delivered by nomadic devices.
