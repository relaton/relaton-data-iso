abstract:
- content: "This document provides guidelines to organizations for establishing the
    general and specific strategies for preventing and reducing crime and the fear
    of crime at a new or existing residential facilities, in single or multiple units.
    \n\nIt recommends the establishment of countermeasures and actions to treat crime
    and security risks against people and property in dwellings and their immediate
    environment (surroundings) through CPTED strategies in an effective and efficient
    manner.\n\nWithin this document, the term “security” is used in a broad manner
    to include all crime, safety and security-specific applications, so it is applicable
    to public and private organizations, regardless of type, size or nature.\nWhile
    this document provides general examples of implementation strategies and best
    practices, it is not intended to provide an exhaustive listing of detailed design,
    architectural or physical security CPTED implementation strategies or restrict
    the potential applications to only those examples provided in this document"
