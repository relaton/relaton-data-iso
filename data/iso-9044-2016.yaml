    ISO 9044:2016 defines terms regarding industrial woven wire cloth for screening purposes and specifies maximum permissible error, requirements, and test methods.
    It applies to industrial woven wire cloth with square apertures, made of steel, stainless steel, or non-ferrous metals (see ISO 4783‑2). It does not apply to woven wire cloth coated after weaving nor does it apply to pre-crimped and welded wire screens which are covered in ISO 4783‑3 and ISO 14315.
    It is of limited application to woven wire cloth used for purposes other than screening which may necessitate other requirements. The alternative requirements may be agreed between the purchaser and the supplier at the time of placing the order.
