    This Recommendation | Technical Report provides:
    a) the description of a means to permit a protocol to be identified;
    b) a record of the structure and allowable ranges of protocol identifier(s) which can be assigned by ITU-T,
    ISO/IEC and other authorities;
    c) a record of the values of protocol identifiers used by OSI Network layer protocols and non-OSI protocols
    occupying a similar position: in particular, protocols with protocol control information commencing in
    octet 1 of the protocol data unit (header-oriented protocols), and protocols with protocol control
    information commencing in the final octet of the protocol data unit (trailer-oriented protocols), are
    covered; and
    d) a record of the values that are in use as protocol control information in non-Network layer protocols
    where they impact on Network layer protocol identification.
    The application of this Recommendation | Technical Report is:
    a) in the identification of internationally standardized Network layer protocols operating directly above the
    Data Link service;
    b) in the identification of protocols used in conjunction with internationally standardized Network layer
    protocols that operate directly above the Data Link service; and
    c) to distinguish between Internationally standardized Network layer protocols, and other internationally
    standardized protocols used in conjunction with internationally standardized Network layer protocols.
    This Recommendation | Technical Report is for use by ITU-T Study Groups, ISO/IEC Technical Committees and other
    authorities in applying the principles contained in clause 4, and in selecting an unused value or values from the range of
    values permitted in clauses 5 or 6, as appropriate. When a new value is selected, that value and its usage should be
    brought to the attention of ITU-T Study Group 7 or ISO/IEC JTC 1 SC6 so that this Recommendation | Technical Report
    can be amended.
