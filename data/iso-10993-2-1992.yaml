abstract:
- content: Specifies minimum requirements for the use of animals in biological testing.
    Is also intended to establish guidelines which allow the scientist to respect
    life in general, to reduce the number of animal experiments and the number of
    animals used in experiments, to minimize suffering and maintain the quality of
    life of the animals used in the experiments. Applies to the experimentation performed
    on vertebrates.
