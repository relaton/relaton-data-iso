abstract:
- content: Applicable to the determination of contents exceeding 1 mg/kg. The principle
    bases on evaporation of the test portion, dissolution in hydrochloric acid and
    reduction by hydroxylammonium chloride. Formation of complexes of interferring
    elements with ammonium citrate and potassium cyanide. Extraction of the lead at
    a pH of between 8.5 and 10 by a solution of dithizone in chloroform. Elimination
    of excess dithizone by an ammoniacal solution of potassium cyanide. Photometric
    measurement in chloroform solution at a wavelength of about 520 nm. Has also been
    approved by the IUPAC.
