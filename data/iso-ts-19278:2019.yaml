    This document specifies a hardness test method for plastics using instrumented indentation in the micro scale with one clearly defined test condition to ensure reproducibility and comparability of test results.
    The test method is selectively suitable for use with the following materials:
    —          moulding, extrusion and cast thermoplastic materials; rigid and semi-rigid thermoplastics sheets;
    —          rigid and semi-rigid thermosetting moulding materials; thermosetting sheets.
    This test method could also be utilized for nanometric filled system, considering the fillers are distributed uniformly in the polymer matrix.
    This test method allows dumbbell type specimen, strip type specimen, platens and specimen cut from any finished parts or products.
    This test method is useful for quality control, material selection, and screening of new formulations.
    NOTE       This document does not aim to describe all scientific or technical aspects of microhardness testing on plastics in general.
