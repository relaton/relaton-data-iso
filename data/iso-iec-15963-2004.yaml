abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 15963:2004 describes numbering systems that are available for
    the identification of RF tags. \nA unique ID is required as part of the write
    operation to RFID tags. The unique ID guarantees that the information written
    to a tag is unambiguously written to the correct data carrier (tag). A unique
    ID is also required in many read situations where the contents of the tag are
    tied to a specific item and that item needs to be unambiguously identified.\nThe
    unique ID may also be used\n- for the traceability of the integrated circuit itself
    for quality control in their manufacturing process;\n- for the traceability of
    the RF tag during its manufacturing process and along its lifetime;\n- for the
    completion of the reading in a multi-antenna configuration; \n- by the anti-collision
    mechanism, to inventory multiple tags in the reader's field of view;\n- for the
    traceability of the item to which the RF tag is attached."
