    This document specifies a metadata structure to store, present and exchange online learning facilitator (OLF) information by specifying the data elements and their attributes to describe facilitator’s information on various kinds of online education platforms.
    This document provides a generic information model of OLF to describe relevant information that applies to the facilitation and training services provided online, and includes information about the person offering facilitation, the affiliation of the person, facilitation ability, facilitation practices, the facilitation service offered, learners’ reviews and testimonies, and related social network information. The conceptual data model allows the linguistic diversity of OLF information attributes and offers a flexible metadata schema to describe them.
    NOTE 1    Although this document provides suggestions on how to designate metadata elements that require privacy protection, it does not provide detailed methods or techniques for how to implement privacy protection measures.
    NOTE 2    For metadata with privacy, the application profile in ISO/IEC 19788-1 can be used to tag data elements concerning privacy and define them with conditions. OLF information privacy protection methods and techniques, such as privacy-by-design, can be selected and applied as needed by implementers.
