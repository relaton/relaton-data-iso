abstract:
- content: From premixes containing different amounts of water and relatively constant
    amounts of the detergent and solvent dry cleaning solutions with the desired final
    concentration of detergent are prepared. The water solubilizing power of the detergent
    is determined by visula assesment of the optical density of the solutions, and,
    after adding water to those solutions that are still clear, the solubilized water
    content for a given concentration of detergent is determined. The water emulsifying
    power of the detergent is determined by observation of phase separation in the
    solutions, and, after adding water to those solutions in which the phases are
    considered not to have separated, the emulsified water content for a given concentration
    of the detergent is determined.
