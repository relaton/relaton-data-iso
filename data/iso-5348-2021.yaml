abstract:
- content: |-
    This document specifies the important technical properties of the different methods for mounting vibration transducers and describes recommended practices. It also shows examples of how accelerometer mounting can influence frequency response and gives examples of how other influences can affect the fidelity of the representation of actual motion in the structure being observed.
    This document applies to the contacting type of accelerometer which is currently in wide use. It is applicable to both uniaxial and multi-axial transducers. This document can also be applied to velocity transducers.
    This document enables the user to estimate the limitations of a mounting and consequent potential measurement deviations.
    Transducer mounting issues are not the only problem that can affect the validity of acceleration measurement. Other such problems include, amongst others: transverse movements, alignment of the transducer, base bending, cable movement, temperature changes, electric and magnetic fields, cable whip and mounting torque. Issues other than mounting and their possible effects are outside the scope of this document.
