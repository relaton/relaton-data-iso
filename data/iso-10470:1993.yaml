abstract:
- content: 'Gives a listing in chart form of the main types of defect. Each of the
    following main types of commercial green coffee is considered separately: wet-processed
    Arabica, dry-processed Arabica, dry-processed Robusta. The chart gives definitions
    and characteristics of each defect, together with its likely cause, and its effect
    on roasting and on brew flavour of the roasted bean. A qualitative assessment
    of the effects of the defects on appearance and flavour is also given in terms
    of their generally accepted significance.'
