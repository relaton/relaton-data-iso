    The standard «criterias for quality internships» will define terms and concepts related to internships, a
    quality framework for internships, quality criteria, and best practices.
    The document is intended for companies, the public sector and other host organizations, individuals
    interested in or taking part in internships (either for students or non-students), higher education
    institutions, public authorities (including quality insurance agencies) and organizations working on
    quality for internships, etc.
    This standard intends to set quality criteria and guidelines for effective and quality internships (both
    during and outside of education, and at national and transnational level), to guide the concerned parties
    in a win-win relation and to simplify the internship process for every type of structure. It presents
    recommendations, not requirements. Therefore, its character is voluntary.
