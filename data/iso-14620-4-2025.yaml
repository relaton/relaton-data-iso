    This document provides requirements for the safety management and operation of assembly, integration and test (AIT) activities related to spacecraft projects and applications including the responsibilities of the organization involved in the AIT operations for spacecraft products.
    This document provides a method to identify hazards, control and reduce safety risk to acceptable levels in the activities of spacecraft assembly, integration, testing, hoisting, logistics and handling.
    This document is applicable to space test centres and entities providing operating infrastructure and facilities for spacecraft AIT. It can serve as a reference for the AIT of the spacecraft system, its subsystems and equipment.
