    This document provides guidance on the relationship between ISO/IEC 20000–1:2018 and two commonly used frameworks, Agile and DevOps. It can be used by any organization or person wishing to understand how Agile and DevOps can be used with ISO/IEC 20000–1, including:
    a)       an organization that has demonstrated or intends to demonstrate conformity to the requirements specified in ISO/IEC 20000–1 and is seeking guidance on the use of Agile or DevOps to establish or improve the SMS and the services;
    b)       an organization that already uses Agile or DevOps and is seeking guidance on how Agile or DevOps can be used to support efforts to demonstrate conformity to the requirements specified in ISO/IEC 20000–1;
    c)        an assessor or auditor who wishes to understand the use of Agile or DevOps as a support for achieving the requirements specified in ISO/IEC 20000–1.
    Both approaches can be used independently or together. Depending on the context, an organization can deploy Agile frameworks only, DevOps frameworks only, use both Agile and DevOps frameworks in isolation, or use an integrated workflow with combined Agile and DevOps approaches. In any of these situations, this document can be used as guidance for the integration of Agile and DevOps practices in an SMS.
    The guidance in this document can assist an organization in planning and preparing for a conformity assessment against ISO/IEC 20000-1, noting that an organization can only claim conformity by fulfilling all requirements specified in ISO/IEC 20000-1.
