    Motorway chauffeur systems (MCS) perform Level 3 automated driving on limited access motorways with the presence of a fallback-ready user (FRU). MCS can be implemented in various forms capable of responding to different driving scenarios. This document describes a framework of MCS including system characteristics, system states/transition conditions and system functions.
    MCS are equipped with a basic set of functionalities to perform in-lane operation and can also be equipped with additional functionalities such as lane changing.
    This document specifies requirements of the basic set of functionalities and test procedures to verify these requirements. The requirements include vehicle operation to perform the entire dynamic driving task (DDT) within the current lane of travel, to issue a request to intervene (RTI) before disengaging, and to extend operation and temporarily continue to perform the DDT after issuing an RTI.
    This document describes one specific form of system engagement. Other forms are possible. These other system engagement forms, especially those provided in combination with other driving automation system features, are not within the scope of this document.
    Requirements and test procedures for the additional functionalities are provided in other parts of the ISO 23792 series.
    Means related to setting a destination and selecting a route to reach the destination are not within the scope of this document. This document applies to MCS installed in light vehicles.
