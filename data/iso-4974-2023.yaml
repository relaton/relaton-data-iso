    This document outlines methodologies for soil temperature measurement and provides guidance on the selection of a measurement method depending on measurement purposes.
    It also gives guidance on characteristics, performance and use of infrared (IR) thermometers which is now widely applied to obtain rapid measurements and thermistors which have been commonly used to obtain more accurate measurements.
