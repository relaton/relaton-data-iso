    Field devices are a key component in intelligent transport systems (ITS). Field devices include traffic signals, message signs, weather stations, traffic sensors, roadside equipment for connected ITS (C-ITS) environments, etc.
    Field devices often need to exchange information with central devices (managers). Field devices can be quite complex necessitating the standardization of many data concepts for exchange. As such, the ISO 22741 series is divided into several individual parts.
    This document identifies basic user needs for the management of virtually any field device and traces these needs to interoperable designs. This includes the ability to identify the device, its capabilities and its status.
    ISO 22741-1 provides additional details about how the ISO 22741 series relates to the overall ITS architecture.
