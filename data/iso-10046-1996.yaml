  content: Covers the methodology of calculating for the determination of the internal
    volumes of both the main deck and the lower deck aircraft cargo compartments.
    The minimum required clearance between the compartment envelope and the unit load
    devices (ULDs) is also stated in order to provide the maximum ULD external contour
    and the methodology to define the ULD internal volumes.
