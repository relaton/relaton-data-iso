- content: |-
    This document provides guidance for developing, implementing and maintaining seismometer systems as a part of the infrastructure for disaster risk reduction in smart communities. The seismometer systems in this document can be used for the observation of seismic activity, such as earthquakes, micro-seismic motion and volcanic tremors, especially in seismically active areas.
    This document gives examples of how different types of seismometers can fulfil the needs and expectations of users and help planners, developers and community operators to effectively use seismometers and related data for disaster risk reduction.
    This document is not applicable to the following:
    —     drop-ball type and pendulum type seismometers;
    —     how to design and develop seismometer systems (e.g. seismometers installed in railway systems).
    The features of the seismometer systems in this document are not intended for the measurement of vibrations caused by landslides.
