  content: This document specifies a laboratory test procedure to evaluate the axial
    (lateral) kerb impact collision properties of a wheel manufactured either wholly
    or partly of light alloys. It is intended for passenger car applications, and
    special vehicle applications where there is a possibility of the wheel impacting
    the kerb, with the purpose of screening and/or quality control of the wheel.
