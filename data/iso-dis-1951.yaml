    This international standard focuses on the presentation of lexicographic articles in language dictionaries, either monolingual, bilingual or multilingual, following a lexicographic lemma-oriented approach, being addressed for human end-users. Concerning the modelling of the underlying data, the ISO 1951:2007 follows the ISO 24613 series.
    The document provides recommendations to deal with the heterogeneous structures of data presentation in lexicographic articles, both in print and digital dictionaries. This document also establishes core concepts, terms and definitions related to the presentation of various components in a lexicographic article.
