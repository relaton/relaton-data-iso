    This document specifies the general and dimensional requirements for the design and performance of hose fittings with 24° cone connector ends with O-rings according to ISO 8434‑1. These hose fittings are made of carbon steel and are intended for use with hoses with nominal inside diameters from 5 mm through 38 mm (inclusive).
    NOTE      For hose fittings used in hydraulic and pneumatic braking systems on road vehicles, see ISO 4038, ISO 4039‑1 and ISO 4039‑2.
    These hose fittings are for use in hydraulic fluid power systems with hoses that meet the requirements of respective hose standards and in general applications with suitable hoses.
