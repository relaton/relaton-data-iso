  content: Specifies the details, dimensions and design of both plug (male) and receptacle
    (female) which must mate properly to permit interchangeable use of different makes
    of electrical connectors providing an auxiliary starting circuit for earth-moving
    machinery as defined in ISO 6165. Lays down a universal connecting device, with
    correct polarity, standard circuit coding and protection from electrical shorts,
    which may also be used with any other machinery, vehicle or automotive equipment
    with the same electrical system voltage range.
