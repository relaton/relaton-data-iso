- content: |-
    ISO 16759:2013 specifies the requirements for quantifying the carbon footprint of those processes, materials and technologies required to produce print media products using any form of printing technology and that are within the user's knowledge and control. It is based on a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) approach, using defined system boundaries and a specified functional unit as the basis for complete or partial carbon footprinting studies. This data can be referenced throughout supply chains for individual print media products.
    ISO 16759:2013 defines standards of completeness to be followed when communicating the results of a carbon footprint study for print media products to business and consumers.
    ISO 16759:2013 provides a framework for carbon calculators that organisations can follow, and that can be used as the structure for market or sector-specific carbon footprinting tools. Studies and tools constructed within this framework methodology provide carbon footprint quantifications of print media products that can be validated and verified.
