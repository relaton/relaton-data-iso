  content: "This document specifies the OID resolution system, including the overall
    architecture and a DNS-based resolution mechanism.\nIt specifies the means for
    inserting any application-defined information associated with an OID node into
    the DNS (see clause 6) and the means of retrieval of that information using the
    ORS (see clause 7).\nIt does not restrict the number of applications it can support.\nIt
    specifies the required operation of an ORS client (see clause 7), including the
    mapping of an OID-IRI value by the ORS client into a DNS name to produce a DNS
    query for the specified application information and the processing of any returned
    information. The ORS has no role in the allocation or registration of OID nodes.\nThe
    required behaviour of an ORS client is specified, but the interfaces to it are
    specified only in terms of the semantics of the interaction. A bit-level application
    program interface is platform and software dependent, and is not in the scope
    of this document. \nA special behaviour of an ORS client is specified to cache
    OID information in order to reduce the response time of OID resolution. This document
    also specifies a mechanism to resolve an OID node when one of its superior OID
    nodes is not ORS-supported.\nIt does not include a tutorial or complete specification
    on the management of DNS zone files (for that, see IETF RFC 1035 and IETF RFC
    3403); it specifies (only) the DNS resource records (see 6.3) that need to be
    inserted in the zone files in order to support ORS access to the information associated
    with an OID node.\nThis document specifies required DNS zone file resource records,
    and prohibits the use of other resource records of a similar form but with different
    semantics (in DNS zone files in the ORS domain) – see 6.2. It does not otherwise
    restrict the general use of DNS zone files."
