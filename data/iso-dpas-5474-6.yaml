    This document defines the requirements and operation of the on-board vehicle equipment that enables dynamic wireless power transfer (D-WPT) for electric vehicles in motion.
    This document addresses the following aspects for an EV device:
    - general requirements in D-WPT;
    - transferred power and power transfer efficiency in D-WPT;
    - interoperability requirements in D-WPT;
    - safety requirements (functional condition, electric safety and EMF/EMC safety) in D-WPT;
    - test procedures in D-WPT
    EV devices that fulfil the requirements in this document are intended to operate with supply devices that fulfil the D-WPT related requirements in the IEC 63243.
    This document is intended to be used for passenger cars and light duty vehicles.  For heavy-duty vehicles, it is under consideration.
