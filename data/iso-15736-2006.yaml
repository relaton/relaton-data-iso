- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: ISO 15736:2006 specifies production tests and inspections, conformity assessment
    procedures, and marking requirements for life-saving appliances that utilize pyrotechnic
    devices in functioning. Specifically, it applies to products which have been evaluated
    and tested in accordance with the IMO Recommendation on testing of life-saving
    appliances, and type approved by maritime administrations to the requirements
    of the IMO Life-Saving Appliance (LSA) Code for use on ships subject to the requirements
    of the 1974 Safety of Life at Sea Convention (as amended). The basic principles
    may be considered suitable for pyrotechnic life-saving appliances manufactured
    to other than the IMO requirements, however ISO 15736:2006 applies directly only
    to products for which it contains specific requirements.
