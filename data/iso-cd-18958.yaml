  content: "This document specifies the composition, tolerances and characteristics,
    i.e. mechanical, acoustic, optical and thermal properties, of folio interlayers
    for the manufacturing of laminated glass and laminated safety glass for use in
    buildings and construction works and it defines their general quality criteria.\n\nNOTE\tIn
    some countries, “film” is used instead of “folio”.\n\nThis document does not apply
    to interlayers for laminated glass which are achieved by pouring the interlayer
    material in liquid state on or between the plies of glass or plastic glazing sheet
    material generally followed by drying or chemical or ultraviolet curing."
