    ISO 22282-4:2012 establishes requirements for pumping tests as part of geotechnical investigation service in accordance with EN 1997-1 and EN 1997-2.
    ISO 22282-4:2012 applies to pumping tests performed on aquifers whose permeability is such that pumping from a well can create a lowering of the piezometric head within hours or days depending on the ground conditions and the purpose. It covers pumping tests carried out in soils and rock.
    The tests concerned by ISO 22282-4:2012 are those intended for evaluating the hydrodynamic parameters of an aquifer and well parameters.
