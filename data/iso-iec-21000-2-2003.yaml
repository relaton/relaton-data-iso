    ISO/IEC 21000 (MPEG-21) defines an open framework for multimedia delivery and consumption, with both the content creator and content consumer as focal points. The vision for MPEG-21 is to define a multimedia framework to enable transparent and augmented use of multimedia resources across a wide range of networks and devices used by different communities.
    The basic architectural concept in MPEG-21 is the Digital Item. Digital Items are structured digital objects, including a standard representation, identification and metadata. They are the basic unit of transaction in the MPEG-21 framework. More concretely, a Digital Item is a combination of resources (such as videos, audio tracks, images, etc), metadata (such as descriptors, identifiers, etc), and structure (describing the relationships between resources).
    This second part of MPEG-21 (ISO/IEC 21000-2:2003) specifies a uniform and flexible abstraction and interoperable schema for declaring the structure and makeup of Digital Items. Digital Items are declared using the Digital Item Declaration Language (DIDL) and declaring a Digital Item involves specifying its resources, metadata and their interrelationships.
    Within ISO/IEC 21000-2:2003 this Digital Item Declaration (DID) technology is described in four main sections:
    - Model: The Digital Item Declaration Model describes a set of abstract terms and concepts to form a useful model for defining Digital Items.
    - Representation: The Digital Item Declaration Language (DIDL) is based upon the terms and concepts defined in the above model. It contains the normative description of the syntax and semantics of each of the DIDL elements, as represented in XML. This section also contains some short non-normative examples for illustrative purposes.
    - Schema: The complete normative XML schema for DIDL comprising the entire grammar of the DID representation.
    - Detailed Examples: Illustrative (non-normative) examples of DIDL documents are provided to aid in understanding the use of the specification and its potential applications.
