abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 8484:2007 specifies the characteristics and location of a magnetic
    stripe on a savingsbook and the use of such savingsbooks for international interchange.
    Compatibility with international interchange systems is provided through the requirements
    of ISO/IEC 8484:2007, enabling a savingsbook with a magnetic stripe to be read
    and possibly encoded in a device that is compatible with reading identification
    cards used in international interchange. It takes into consideration both human
    and machine aspects and states minimum requirements.\nISO/IEC 8484:2007 specifies
    requirements for a magnetic stripe (including any protective overlay) on a savingsbook,
    the encoding technique and coded character sets. It also specifies the characteristics
    of the savingsbook cover such as stiffness, minimum size, surface irregularities,
    roughness and interaction between the cover material and the magnetic stripe.
    Most of the magnetic characteristics are based on ISO/IEC 7811-2. The major changes
    from ISO 8484:1987 include the following.\n- ISO/IEC 8484:2007 uses the same definitions,
    criteria and test methods as in ISO/IEC 7811-2. \n- The reference material has
    changed from SRM 3200 to RM 7811/2. \n- More complete requirements have been added
    for signal amplitude, flux transition spacing variation, magnetic stripe area
    surface profile and warpage. \n- Classifications have been added for unused and
    returned savingsbooks. \n- An optional high coercivity magnetic stripe has been
    added based on ISO/IEC 7811-6 and RM 7811/6.\nBecause savingsbooks are generally
    paper-based documents, some criteria and test methods have been taken from ISO/IEC
    15457-2.\nISO/IEC 8484:2007 specifies\n- the conditions for conformance;\n- physical
    characteristics for the savingsbook (warpage, surface distortions, and stiffness)
    and the magnetic stripe area (location, height and surface profile, roughness,
    adhesion, wear, and resistance to environment),\n- the signal amplitude performance
    characteristics of the magnetic stripe;\n- the encoding specification, including
    technique, angle of recording, bit density, flux transition spacing variation,
    and signal amplitude;\n- the data structure, including track format, coded character
    sets and use of error correction;\n- the location of the encoded track.\nISO/IEC
    8484:2007, together with a standard for test methods, provides for interchange
    between various types of savingsbook processing devices and systems."
