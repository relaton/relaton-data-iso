abstract:
- content: "ISO 8468:2007 specifies the functional requirements for bridge configuration,
    bridge arrangement, bridge workstations and bridge environment. Guidelines have
    been drawn up for the methods and solutions to meet the functional requirements.
    The requirements in ISO 8468:2007 apply to all bridge functions.\nThe purpose
    of ISO 8468:2007 is to assist the operator(s) and pilot by providing a workplace
    that is conducive to safe and effective operation. It also aims to specify bridge
    requirements, which will secure safe and efficient operation of the ship berth-to-berth
    regardless of the watchkeeping arrangement in place at a particular time. ISO
    8468:2007 should be used in support of the aims in SOLAS Chapter V Regulation
    15.\nRequirements and guidance on the human element aspects of the bridge system
    (e.g. training, procedures) are not given. \nThe main use of ISO 8468:2007 will
    be for designing ships' bridges. ISO 8468:2007 will also be useful to specifiers
    and procurers of ships and bridge equipment, operators, and owners for ensuring
    that changes made to the bridge through the life of a ship continue to conform
    to these requirements.\nISO 8468:2007 is applicable to seagoing ships. Annex A
    of ISO 8468:2007 applies to high speed craft."
