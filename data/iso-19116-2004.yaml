  content: ISO 19116:2004 specifies the data structure and content of an interface
    that permits communication between position-providing device(s) and position-using
    device(s) so that the position-using device(s) can obtain and unambiguously interpret
    position information and determine whether the results meet the requirements of
    the use. A standardized interface of geographic information with position allows
    the integration of positional information from a variety of positioning technologies
    into a variety of geographic information applications, such as surveying, navigation
    and intelligent transportation systems. ISO 19116:2004 will benefit a wide range
    of applications for which positional information is important.
