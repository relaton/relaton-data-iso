abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 24759:2008 specifies the methods to be used by testing laboratories
    to test whether a cryptographic module conforms to the requirements specified
    in ISO/IEC 19790:2006. The methods are developed to provide a high degree of objectivity
    during the testing process and to ensure consistency across the testing laboratories.
    Within each subclause of the security requirements clause of ISO/IEC 24759:2008,
    the corresponding security requirements from ISO/IEC 19790:2006 are divided into
    a set of assertions (i.e. statements that have to be true for the module to satisfy
    the requirement of a given area at a given level). All of the assertions are direct
    quotations from ISO/IEC 19790:2006.\nFollowing each assertion is a set of requirements
    levied on the vendor. These specify the types of documentation or explicit information
    that the vendor is required to provide in order for the tester to verify conformance
    to the given assertion. \nAlso following each assertion and the requirements levied
    on the vendor is a set of requirements levied on the tester of the cryptographic
    module. These specify what the tester needs to do in order to test the cryptographic
    module with respect to the given assertion.\nVendors can use ISO/IEC 24759:2008
    as guidance in trying to verify whether their cryptographic modules satisfy the
    requirements specified in ISO/IEC 19790:2006 before they apply to the testing
    laboratory for testing."
