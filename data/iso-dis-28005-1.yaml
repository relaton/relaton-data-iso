    1 Scope
    This part of ISO 28005 specifies necessary guidance information related to electronic port clearance (EPC), such as message transmission requirements, business scenarios, message structures and software requirements. Within the context of this part of ISO 28005, EPC incudes the activities that a user, such as a ship's master, a shipping agency or a ship owner undertakes to submit electronic data to appropriate organizations that approve or reject the clearance for the ship to enter or leave port.
    Annex A provides implementation advice for a single window (SW). Annex B suggests a methodology for the development of a SW.
    This part of ISO 28005 defines XML message structures for the transmission of information between a ship or its representatives and certain organizations responsible for the processing of the ship's port clearance request. The information intended to be transferred is that which is defined by the FAL Convention and other related international instruments as identified by ISO 28005-2. These message structures are primary intended for machine -to- machine data transfers.
    This part of ISO 28005 allows different configurations of the SW, from a minimum solution to support basic clearance requirements to a more complex system to facilitate more extensive cooperation between ship and shore organizations.
