    This document specifies the characteristic values for selected two-, three- and four-lobe bearings.
    The functions plotted and listed in table form below are required for the operationally safe design of hydrodynamic multi-lobed journal bearings according to ISO/TS 31657-1. They are based on the presumptions and boundary conditions indicated there and only apply to stationary operating states. The symbols used are explained in ISO/TS 31657-1; calculation examples are also included there.
