abstract:
- content: "ISO 16609:2004 specifies procedures, independent of the transmission process,
    for protecting the integrity of transmitted banking messages and for verifying
    that a message has originated from an authorized source. It also specifies a method
    by which block ciphers can be approved for use in the authentication of banking
    messages. In addition, because of the necessity for both members in a communicating
    pair to use the same means for data representation, it defines some methods for
    data representation. A list of block ciphers approved for the calculation of a
    message authentication code (MAC), as well as the method to be used to approve
    additional block ciphers, is also provided. The authentication methods it defines
    are applicable to messages formatted and transmitted both as coded character sets
    and as binary data.\nISO 16609:2004 is designed for use with symmetric algorithms
    where both sender and receiver use the same key. It does not specify methods for
    establishing the shared key, nor does it provide for encipherment for the protection
    of messages against unauthorized disclosure. Its application will not protect
    the user against internal fraud by sender or receiver, or forgery of a MAC by
    the receiver. "
