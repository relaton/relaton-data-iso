    ISO/IEC TR 15443-2:2012 builds on the concepts presented in ISO/IEC TR 15443-1.

    ISO/IEC TR 15443-2:2012 proposes criteria for comparing and analysing different SACA methods. The reader is cautioned that the methods used as examples in ISO/IEC TR 15443-2:2012 are considered to represent popularly used methods at the time of its writing. New methods may appear, and modification or withdrawal of the methods cited may occur. It is intended that the criteria can be used to describe and compare any SACA method whatever its provenance.
