  content: This document specifies broadcast authentication protocols, which are protocols
    that provide data integrity and entity authentication in a broadcast setting,
    i.e. a setting with one sender transmitting messages to many receivers. To provide
    entity authentication, there needs to be a pre-existing infrastructure which links
    the sender to a cryptographic secret. The establishment of such an infrastructure
    is beyond the scope of this document.
