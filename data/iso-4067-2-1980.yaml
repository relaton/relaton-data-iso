  content: 'The representations are primarily intended for use on plans and diagrams
    at a scale 1 : 50. For smaller scale drawings more simplified and for larger scale
    drawings more detailed representations may be used. For diagrams the representation
    in column "Elevation" will normally be apparopriate. For making the drawing clearer
    the views may be combined with symbols and/or abbreviated component references,
    which are explained in the drawing or elsewhere.'
