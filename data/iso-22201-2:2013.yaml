    ISO 22201-2:2013 is applicable to the product family of escalators and moving walks used in residential buildings, offices, hospitals, hotels, industrial plants, etc. It covers those aspects that need to be addressed when programmable electronic systems are used to carry out electric safety functions for escalators and moving walks (PESSRAE). It is applicable for escalator and moving walk safety functions that are identified in escalator and moving walk codes, standards, or laws that reference ISO 22201-2:2013 for PESSRAE application. The safety integrity levels (SILs) specified in ISO 22201-2:2013 are understood to be valid for PESSRAE application in the context of the referenced escalator and moving walk codes, standards, and laws in Annex B.
    ISO 22201-2:2013 is also applicable for the application of PESSRAE that are new or deviate from those described in ISO 22201-2:2013.
    The requirements of ISO 22201-2:2013 regarding electrical safety/protective devices are such that the possibility of a failure of an electric safety/protective device complying with all the requirements of the standard needs not to be taken into consideration.
    In particular, ISO 22201-2:2013:
