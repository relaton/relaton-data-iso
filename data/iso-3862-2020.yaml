    This document specifies requirements for five types of spiral-wire-reinforced hydraulic hoses and hose assemblies of nominal size from 6,3 to 51.
    They are suitable for use with:
    —     oil-based hydraulic fluids HH, HL, HM, HR and HV as defined in ISO 6743-4 at temperatures ranging from −40 °C to +100 °C for types 4SP and 4SH hoses and from −40 °C to +120 °C for types R12, R13 and R15 hoses;
    —     water-based fluids HFC, HFAE, HFAS and HFB as defined in ISO 6743-4 at temperatures ranging from −40 °C to +70 °C;
    —     water at temperatures ranging from 0 °C to +70 °C.
    This document does not include requirements for end fittings. It is limited to requirements for hoses and hose assemblies.
    NOTE    It is the responsibility of the user, in consultation with the hose manufacturer, to establish the compatibility of the hose with the fluid to be used.
