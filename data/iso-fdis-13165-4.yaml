abstract:
- content: "This document specifies methods to determine 226Ra in all types of waters
    by alpha spectrometry.\n\nThe methods are applicable to test samples of supply/drinking
    water, rainwater, surface and ground water, marine water, as well as cooling water,
    industrial water, domestic, and industrial wastewater after proper sampling and
    handling, and test sample preparation. \n\nThe detection limit depends on the
    sample volume, the instrument used, the background count rate, the detection efficiency,
    the counting time, and the chemical yield. The detection limit of the methods
    described in this document, using currently available alpha spectrometry apparatus,
    is ≤ 1 mBq·l-1 (or mBq·kg-1), which is lower than the WHO criteria for safe consumption
    of drinking water (1 Bq·l-1). This value can typically be achieved with a counting
    time of 48 h for a test sample volume of 1 l. \n\nThe method described in this
    document is applicable in the event of an emergency situation. For an emergency
    situation, it is preferable to reduce the counting time rather than the sample
    volume. \n\nFiltration of the test sample is necessary. The analysis of 226Ra
    adsorbed to suspended matter is not covered by this method. If suspended material
    has to be removed or analysed, filtration using a 0,45 μm filter is recommended.
    The analysis of the insoluble fraction requires a mineralization step that is
    not covered by this document. In this case, the measurement is made on the different
    phases obtained. The final activity is the sum of all the measured activity concentrations."
