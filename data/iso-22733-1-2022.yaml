- content: |-
    This document specifies a method to evaluate the behaviour of a vehicle equipped with an autonomous emergency braking system (AEBS), or dynamic brake support (DBS) during several accident scenarios. Those accidents occur during a straight-line driving when the vehicle under test (VUT) approaches another vehicle in the same lane. Both vehicles are aligned in longitudinal axis to each other.
    The most important part of the vehicle behaviour during these accidents scenarios is the capacity to avoid or mitigate the collision.
    Systems requiring driver intervention are not in the scope of this document.
    NOTE      Depending on accidentology, only a part of the scenarios can be used for an evaluation of performance. AEB system evaluation based upon this document is limited to longitudinal accident scenarios.
