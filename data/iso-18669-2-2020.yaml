    This document defines the measuring principles used for measuring piston pins; it applies to piston pins with a nominal outer diameter from 8 mm up to and including 100 mm, for reciprocating internal combustion engines for road vehicles and other applications.
    In certain applications, except road vehicles, and provided that mutual agreement is made between the purchaser and the manufacturer, this document can be used with suitable modifications.
