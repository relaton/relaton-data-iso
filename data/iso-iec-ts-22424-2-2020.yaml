    The ISO/IEC TS 22424 series supports long-term preservation of EPUB publications via a dual strategy. This document makes EPUB compliant with current practices of Open Archival Information Systems (OAIS) archives and technical requirements of repository systems. The former tend to rely on OAIS in their operations; the latter prefer to ingest electronic documents only in containers conforming to standards such as METS (Metadata Encoding and Transmission Standard).
    ISO/IEC TS 22424-1 considers EPUB features from a long-term preservation point of view.
