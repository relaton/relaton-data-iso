    ISO/TS 27469:2010 specifies a method for determining the following:
    ISO/TS 27469:2010 applies to different start-up operations for different types of furnace and, therefore, tolerances in test conditions at the beginning of the test are not described in detail. The fire test enables only a limited assessment of the actuating mechanism being carried out and additional tests can be necessary to fully evaluate its operational reliability.
