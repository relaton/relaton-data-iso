    ISO 6517:2013 covers the minimum design and operational testing requirements for general purpose base-restrained containers exclusively intended for the lower deck compartments of main line civil transport aircraft, capable of being used by either airlines or shippers and requiring airworthiness authority approval (certification).
    ISO 6517:2013 does not cover the performance requirements and ultimate load testing parameters for approval by airworthiness authorities (certification), which are covered in ISO 21100 or, for units approved prior to 2012, ISO 8097:2001. The design and operational testing requirements of ISO 6517:2013 are additional to those of these standards.
