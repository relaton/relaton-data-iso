abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010:2011 addresses the creation, analysis and sustainment
    of architectures of systems through the use of architecture descriptions. A conceptual
    model of architecture description is established. The required contents of an
    architecture description are specified. Architecture viewpoints, architecture
    frameworks and architecture description languages are introduced for codifying
    conventions and common practices of architecture description. The required content
    of architecture viewpoints, architecture frameworks and architecture description
    languages is specified. Annexes provide the motivation and background for key
    concepts and terminology and examples of applying ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010:2011.
