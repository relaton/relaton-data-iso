    The purpose of ISO 29584:2015 is to evaluate, by means of soft body impactors, safe breakage characteristics of glazing products intended to reduce cutting and piercing injuries to persons through accidental impact.
    ISO 29584:2015 examines test methods currently employed to determine the pendulum impact performance of safety glass. Use of the methodologies in this International Standard improves the reproducibility of test results and gives a common basis of classification. The aim is for the performance of glass products manufactured and tested in various countries to be better understood and more consistent.
    Two types of soft body impactors are defined. The traditional shot bag impactor is detailed both in terms of manufacture and maintenance in an attempt to overcome problems associated with such impactors becoming misshapen. The twin tyre impactor is also detailed.
    The test equipment, excluding the impactor, is also described. A method of calibrating the test frame is given. The benefit of calibrating the test equipment is the increased reproducibility of the test results.
    Classification of glass products is also detailed. The classification system allows information on the following to be given:
    a)    the maximum drop height at which the glass either did not break or broke safely, i.e. in a manner similar to laminated glass or toughened glass;
    b)    the manner in which the glass would break, i.e. as toughened glass, laminated glass, annealed glass, irrespective of whether or not the glass was broken during the test;
    c)    the maximum drop height at which the glass either did not break or broke safely, i.e. in a manner similar to laminated glass.
    ISO 29584:2015 does not specify the intended use of the products, but provides a method of classification in terms of the performance of the materials being tested. The impact energy used for the various levels of classification are designed to provide the intended user or the legislator with the information to assist in defining the level of safety and protection required relative to the intended location at which the selected safety glass is to be used.
