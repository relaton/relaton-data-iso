    ISO 13655:2017 specifies procedures for the measurements and colorimetric computations appropriate to objects that reflect, transmit and emit light, such as flat-panel displays. It also specifies procedures for computation of colorimetric parameters for graphic arts images. Graphic arts include, but are not limited to, the preparation of material for, and volume production by, production printing processes that include offset lithography, letterpress, flexography, gravure, screen and digital printing.
    ISO 13655:2017 does not address spectral measurements appropriate to other specific application needs, such as those used during the production of materials, for example, printing paper and proofing media.
