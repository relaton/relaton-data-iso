    ISO 10384:2008 applies to continuously hot-rolled carbon steel sheet as defined by chemical composition. The product is generally used in the heat-treated condition after hot or cold working, press forming or cutting by the customer. For example, the product is used for general machinery such as sprocket wheels, chain links, washers, knife blades and agricultural implements.
    Steel sheet that is to be subjected to subsequent rerolling is not covered by ISO 10384:2008.
