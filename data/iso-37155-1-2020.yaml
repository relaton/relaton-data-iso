    This document describes a framework (a set of processes and methodologies) for smart community infrastructure interactions (interactions between multiple infrastructures, between infrastructures and stakeholders, and between infrastructures and the external environment) to ensure that such interactions are well identified and managed.
    There are two potential use cases for this document. The first is for green field sites, where all the smart community infrastructures can be designed and developed at the same time. This is of value to planners and investors of major new infrastructure developments.
    The second builds on the first and will support efficient management of an existing urban area by taking into account the increasing interdependencies of the infrastructures on each other and the way they should be managed as a system of systems. This document will also take into account accelerating technological and environmental changes.
    Since this framework is concerned with ensuring the consistency of different systems consisting of smart community infrastructures, the scope does not overlap with any existing work or deliverables that have been or are being developed by existing TCs addressing issues at individual infrastructure level.
    NOTE    This document describes a management case (not a management system), i.e. specific processes that an organization needs to follow in order to meet specific objectives of this document.
