    This document describes processes, methods and procedures for the establishment within an organization of a procurement system for goods, services, and construction works or disposals, or any combination thereof that is fair, equitable, transparent, competitive and cost-effective. This document
    a)   describes generic procurement processes around which an employer can develop its procurement system,
    b)   establishes basic requirements for the conduct of an employer's employees, agents, board members and office bearers when engaging in procurement,
    c)   establishes the framework for the development of an employer's procurement policy, including any secondary procurement policy, and
    d)   establishes generic methods and procedures for procurements, including those pertaining to disposals.
    This document provides a generic and standard set of processes, procedures and methods for a procurement system which can be applied by both the public and private sector organizations in the development of their procurement system. The principles contained in this document can also be applied down the supply chain.
    This document enables organizations to develop in the first instance a generic procurement system and then to identify the methods and procedures best suited to particular categories of procurement.
