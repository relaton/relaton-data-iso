    This international standard defines the mechanical, electrical, timing, and protocol requirements of the
    SCSI parallel interface to allow conforming devices to interoperate. The SCSI parallel interface is a local
    I/O bus that may be operated over a wide range of transfer rates. The objectives of the SCSI parallel
    interface are
    a) To provide host computers with device independence within a class of devices. Thus, different disk
    drives, tape drives, printers, optical media drives, and other devices may be added to the host
    computers without requiring modifications to generic system hardware. Provision is made for the
    addition of special features and functions through the use of vendor-specific options. Reserved areas
    are provided for future standardization.
    b) To provide compatibility such that properly conforming SCSI-2 devices may interoperate with
    SCSI-3 devices given that the systems engineering is correctly done. Properly conforming SCSI-2
    devices should respond in an acceptable manner to reject SCSI-3 protocol extensions. SCSI-3
    protocol extensions are designed to be permissive of such rejections and thus allow the SCSI-2
    devices to continue operation without requiring the use of the extension.
    The interface protocol includes provision for the connection of multiple initiators (SCSI devices capable of
    initiating an I/O process) and multiple targets (SCSI devices capable of responding to a request to perform
    an I/O process). Distributed arbitration (i.e., bus-contention logic) is built into the architecture of SCSI. A
    default priority system awards interface control to the highest priority SCSI device that is contending for
    use of the bus and an optional fairness algorithm is defined.
    This standard defines the physical attributes of an input/output bus for interconnecting computers and
    peripheral devices.
    Figure 1 is intended to show the general structure of SCSI standards. The figure is not intended to imply a
    relationship such as a hierarchy, protocol stack, or system architecture.

    This international standard is intended as an alternate to the SCSI-3 Parallel Interface Standard. This
    international standard, in addition to containing all the information in the SCSI-3 Parallel Interface Standard
    contains information and specifications for LVD and fast-40 along with many other improvements.
