  content: "ISO 21213:2008 determines the air interface options applicable to CALM
    using third generation (3G) cellular networks. In particular, it specifies protocols
    and parameters that 3G systems shall include to support prolonged, long-range,
    high data rate wireless communication links in ITS environments where heterogeneous
    handovers or media independent handovers (MIH) are either necessary to maintain
    the link, or desirable, as determined by media selection policies.\nISO 21213:2008
    provides protocols and parameters for long range, medium speed wireless communications
    in the ITS sector using third generation cellular communications.\nWherever practicable,
    ISO 21213:2008 has been developed by reference to suitable extant Standards, adopted
    by selection. Required regional variations are provided.  \nSpecifically, for
    ISO 21213:2008, extant 3G systems, as defined by various international and national
    standards, are adopted by reference.\nApplication specific upper layers are not
    included in ISO 21213:2008, but will be driven by application standards (which
    may not be technology specific)."
