    This document gives the definitions and specifies the minimum requirements for injection moulded, extruded, compression moulded and thermoformed thermoplastics cuboid shaped boxes, including integral components, used in underground systems for retention, detention, storage and transportation of non-potable water (e.g. storm water) and manufactured from polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP) or unplasticized polyvinylchloride (PVC-U).
    The boxes are intended for buried underground use, e.g. in landscape, pedestrian or vehicular traffic areas.
    In the case of retention and detention systems, the main purpose of the boxes is to retain water, for later infiltration in the ground or for later use in non-potable applications (irrigation, cleaning, sanitary facilities, etc.) or to retain water during a storm, transferring it in a controlled way to the public storm water network.
    Applications include commercial, residential, agricultural and highway drainage, including installation under parking lots and roadways.
    Product performance is determined by a combination of material specification, product design and manufacturing process.
    A box can either be factory-assembled or site-assembled from different components.
    The boxes are intended to be used as elements in a modular system where the manufacturer has provided a clearly documented method specifying how the components are assembled to create a complete retention, detention, storage and transportation system. The boxes are installed as one or more horizontal layers on a firm foundation and embedded with fill around and above the complete system.
    NOTE       Non-load bearing component(s) can be manufactured by various methods (e.g. extrusion, injection moulding, rotational moulding, compression moulded, thermoforming and low-pressure injection moulding) and are not within the scope of this document.
