abstract:
- content: This Technical Report applies to primary batteries known as "button cells"
    and "small batteries" and used as the energy source of watches. Applications of
    such batteries in general are covered within IEC/TC 35, e.g. in IEC 86. However,
    specific requirements for applications in watches are not sufficiently covered
    by IEC 86. Therefore, ISO/TC 114 laid down this Report taking care of the justified
    wish of both manufacturers of watches and consumers to provide more detailed specifications
    and requirements for leakage conditions and testing.
