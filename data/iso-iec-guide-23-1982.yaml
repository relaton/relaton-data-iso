abstract:
- content: This Guide lays down methods of indicating conformity with standards and
    reference thereto in standards. Whilst it is directed specifically to conformity
    with standards, it is recognized that it may be equally applicable to conformity
    with other technical specifications. It applies to indications of conformity made
    under the authority of a certification body. This Guide is primarily intended
    for International Standards but may be used for national standards or other purposes,
    too.
