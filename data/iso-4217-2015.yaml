    ISO 4217:2015 specifies the structure for a three-letter alphabetic code and an equivalent three-digit numeric code for the representation of currencies. For those currencies having minor units, it also shows the decimal relationship between such units and the currency itself.
    The scope of this International Standard also includes funds and precious metals.
    ISO 4217:2015 also includes basic guidelines for its maintenance.
    ISO 4217:2015 is intended for use in any application of trade, commerce and banking, where currencies and, where appropriate, funds are required to be described. It is designed to be equally suitable for manual users and for those employing automated systems.
