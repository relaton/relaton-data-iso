abstract:
- content: "ISO/TR 13184-1:2013 specifies guidance information protocol to provide
    real-time decision support system to drivers or pedestrians using personal ITS
    stations:\na) Reference architecture for real-time decision support systems      This
    reference architecture provides a general structure for real-time decision support
    systems and the method of message exchange between the personal ITS station and
    the roadside ITS station. This reference architecture is used to build the interconnections
    between personal ITS stations and roadside ITS stations. \nb) Design method of
    application protocols for light-weighted devices           This method is a flexible
    application protocol for safety warning and parking guidance services. Unlike
    many other application protocols in the ITS and Telematics domains, this protocol
    makes the client part independent of use cases for supporting light-weighted devices.
    \ \nc) Use cases at the road and parking bays for warning and parking guide    ISO/TR
    13184-1:2013 describes the use cases applicable to the communication services
    between personal ITS stations and roadside ITS stations for the purposes of providing
    safety warning and parking guidance. "
