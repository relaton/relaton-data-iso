  script: Latn
  content: ISO/IEC 18328-1:2015 describes the general architecture of an ICC with
    ICC-managed devices. ISO/IEC 18328-1:2015 is one of a series of International
    Standards which outlines the content and the boundaries covered and standardised
    by the other parts of ISO/IEC 18328. The general principle of this part of ISO/IEC
    18328 is that all activities regarding the ICC-managed devices are controlled
    by the card-IC. This principle also applies when ICC-managed devices are outside
    the card. ISO/IEC 18328-1:2015 is applicable for all kind of cards independent
    from interface technology for communication.
