    ISO 21930:2007 provides the principles and requirements for type III environmental declarations (EPD) of building products.
    ISO 21930:2007 contains specifications and requirements for the EPD of building products. Where this International Standard contains more specific requirements, it complements ISO 14025 for the EPD of building products.
    ISO 21930:2007 provides a framework for and the basic requirements for product category rules as defined in ISO 14025 for type III environmental declarations of building products. Type III environmental declarations for building products, as described in ISO 21930:2007, are primarily intended for use in business-to-business communication, but their use in business-to-consumer communication under certain conditions is not precluded.
    ISO 21930:2007 does not define requirements for developing type III environmental declaration programmes. Requirements for type III environmental declaration programmes are found in ISO 14025.
    The working environment is not included in ISO 21930:2007 because it is normally a subject for national legislation.
