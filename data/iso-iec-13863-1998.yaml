    This International Standard specifies the Path Replacement additional network feature (ANF-PR), which is applicable to
    various basic services supported by Private Integrated Services Networks (PISN). Basic services are specified in
    ISO/IEC 11574.
    ANF-PR is a feature which applies to an established call, allowing that call's connection between Private Integrated Services
    Network Exchanges (PINXs) to be replaced by a new connection. If the new connection is required to satisfy certain criteria,
    ANF-PR should be used in conjunction with other supplementary services and/or ANFs. Annex A gives examples of the
    circumstances under which ANF-PR can be used and criteria which can govern the selection of the new connection.
    Additional network feature specifications are produced in three stages, according to the method described in CCITT
    Recommendation I.130 for supplementary services. This International Standard contains the stage 1 and stage 2 specifications
    of ANF-PR. The stage 1 specification (clause 6) specifies the feature as seen by an entity which initiates path replacement, the
    ANF-PR user. The stage 2 specification (clauses 7, 8 and 9) identifies the functional entities involved in the feature and the
    information flows between them. Clause 7 contains the stage 2 specification for basic operation of the feature. Clause 8
    contains the stage 2 specification for an enhanced mode of working which can be employed when supported by all the
    equipment involved. It allows some of the elements of the old connection to be re-used. Clause 9 contains the stage 2
    specification for an optional enhancement of the basic operation of the feature. It allows the ANF-PR user to be located in any
    PINX in the old connection and to decide the direction of the new connection.
