abstract:
- content: "ISO 17664:2004 specifies the information to be provided by the medical
    device manufacturer on the processing of medical devices claimed to be resterilizable,
    and medical devices intended to be sterilized by the processor. ISO 17664:2004
    specifies requirements for the information to be provided by the medical device
    manufacturer, so that the medical device can be processed safely and will continue
    to meet its performance specification.\nRequirements are specified for processing
    that consists of all or some of the following activities: \na) preparation at
    the point of use;\nb) preparation, cleaning, disinfection;\nc) drying;\nd) inspection,
    maintenance and testing;\ne) packaging;\nf) sterilization;\ng) storage.\nWhen
    providing instructions for these activities, medical device manufacturers are
    expected to be aware of the training and knowledge of procedures, and of the processing
    equipment available to the persons likely to be responsible for processing. It
    is likely that some processing procedures will be generic and well known and will
    use equipment and consumables conforming to recognized standards. In this case,
    a reference in the instructions is all that is required. For those medical devices
    where instructions for use are not required to accompany the medical device, other
    means of communicating the information can be used, e.g. user manuals, symbols
    or wall charts supplied separately.\nThe principles of ISO 17664:2004 may be applied
    when considering the information to be supplied with medical devices which only
    require disinfection prior to re-use. \nISO 17664:2004 is not applicable to textile
    devices used in patient-draping systems or surgical clothing."
