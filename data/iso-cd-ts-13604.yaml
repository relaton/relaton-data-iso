abstract:
- content: The methodology for the standard-target calibration of active sonar systems
    used for imaging and for measuring scattering will be elaborated for eventual
    standardization in measurement protocols for individual sonars.  This applies
    to echo sounders, multibeam sonars, sidescan sonars, parametric sonars, and other
    active sonar systems.  The nominal span of sonar operating frequencies is from
    1 kHz to several megahertz, including both narrowband and broadband signals.  Excluded
    from the standard are active sonars whose output cannot be calibrated because
    of uncontrolled processes.
