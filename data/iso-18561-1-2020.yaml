    This document gives guidelines for providing mobility information according to user preference on demand, utilizing a variety of existing applications on nomadic devices related to different means of transport. This document defines an integrated mobility information platform as a service methodology to be integrated with a variety of mobile apps with respect to different transport modes.
    This document defines the following urban mobility applications:
    —     guidance documents to facilitate the practical implementation of identified standards in the transportation planning process, including related use cases;
    —     provision of urban mobility information integrated with a variety of mobile apps on nomadic devices by multiple transport modes for collecting trip production and attraction data;
    —     modal choice data based on time effectiveness, cost effectiveness, and eco-effectiveness in the trip distribution from origins to destinations.
