    The scope of ISO/TR 17427-10:2015 is, as an informative document, to identify potential critical driver distraction (2.4) and information display issues that C-ITS service provision may introduce, to consider strategies for how to identify, control, limit or mitigate such issues. The objective of this Technical Report is to raise awareness of and consideration of such issues and to give pointers, where appropriate, to existing standards deliverables that provide specifications for all or some of these aspects. This Technical Report does not provide specifications for solutions of these issues.
    Existing rules (2.12) govern the use of technology inside vehicles to reduce driver distraction.
