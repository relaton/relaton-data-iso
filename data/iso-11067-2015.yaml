- content: |-
    ISO 11067:2015 contains the basic warning strategy, minimum functionality requirements, basic driver interface elements, minimum requirements for diagnostics and reaction to failure, and performance test procedures for Curve Speed Warning Systems (CSWS). CSWS warns the driver against the danger caused by maintaining excessive speed to negotiate the upcoming curved roads, so that the driver may reduce the speed. The system does not include the means to control the vehicle to meet the desired speed. The responsibility for safe operation of the vehicle always remains with the driver.
    It applies to vehicles with four or more wheels.
