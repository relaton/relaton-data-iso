  content: "ISO 23551-2:2006 specifies safety, constructional and performance requirements
    for pressure regulators intended for use with gas burners and gas burning appliances.
    It also describes the test procedures for checking compliance with these requirements
    and provides information necessary for the purchaser and user. \nISO 23551-2:2006
    applies to pressure regulators for gas burners and gas burning appliances of nominal
    connection size up to and including DN 250 that can be used and tested independently
    of these appliances. These regulators are suitable for fuel gases, such as natural
    gas, manufactured gas or liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) at inlet pressures up to
    and including 50 kPa.\nISO 23551-2:2006 covers type testing only.\nISO 23551-2:2006
