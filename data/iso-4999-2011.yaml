    ISO 4999:2011 is applicable to cold-reduced carbon steel sheet of commercial, drawing and structural qualities coated by a continuous hot‑dip terne (lead alloy) coating process. It includes the group of products commonly known as terne plate or terne sheets (or in the USA as terne coated).
    Terne sheets are used where ease of solderability, a degree of corrosion resistance, or amenability to stamping, pressing or deep-drawing would be advantageous.
    Terne (lead alloy) coated steel sheet can be ordered in one of two ordering conditions:
