    This document specifies the design criteria and testing methods adequate to guarantee the ultimate strength and operational dependability of cargo restraint sling assemblies made of steel wire rope, with a 22,25 kN (5 000 lbf) rated ultimate load capability, as can be used by the airline industry in order to restrain on board civil transport aircraft during flight, including the following:
    —    cargo loaded and tied down onto airworthiness approved air cargo pallets, themselves restrained into aircraft lower deck, main deck or upper deck cargo systems and meeting the requirements of ISO 8097 (NAS 3610) or ISO 21100, or
    —    non-unitized individual pieces of cargo, or pieces of cargo placed onto an unrestrained ("floating") pallet into either lower deck, main deck or upper deck containerized cargo compartments of an aircraft, to be restrained onto aircraft structure attachment (tie-down) points.
    Two types of wire rope restraint slings are defined:
    a) type A: adjustable length restraint sling assemblies, including a tension retaining device and termination fittings attached to the wire rope end eyes;
    b) type B: fixed length restraint sling extensions, to be used in conjunction with a type A cable; extensions are usually terminated at both ends by eyes, without additional fittings, and can be attached through hooks or shackles.
    The cables specified in this document are intended exclusively for restraint purposes on board aircraft, and not for use as lifting slings.
