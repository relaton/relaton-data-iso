- content: |-
    This document describes an extended test method determining the resistance to jet fires of passive fire protection materials and systems or critical process control equipment. It gives an indication of how PFP materials or equipment behaves in a severe jet fire and provides performance data under the specified conditions.
    It does not include an assessment of other properties of the passive fire protection material such as weathering, ageing, shock resistance, impact or explosion resistance, or smoke production.
    This document is intended to be complementary to part one of ISO 22899 for situations when the required fire conditions or limitations on test specimen size/type preclude application of part one.
