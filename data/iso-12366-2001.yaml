    This International Standard specifies tests and measurement methods for solo mopeds (defined in ISO 3833)
    equipped with one or more antilock, and one or more independent, braking systems. Its purpose is to establish
    uniform worldwide test procedures for such systems.
    This International Standard sets out procedures for the following types of straight-line braking tests:
     utilization-of-adhesion test;
     wheel-lock check test;
     tests with ABS failed;
     complementary tests that could assist in the assessment and development of braking systems.
    NOTE Reference is made in this International Standard to L-category vehicles, generally referring to solo mopeds (L1),
    drawn from Regulation No. 78 and the Consolidated Resolution on the Construction of Vehicles (R.E.3) of the United Nations
    Economic Commission for Europe (UN-ECE). The values given in this International Standard enclosed by square brackets are from
    the same regulation (02 series of amendments), and are included for information.
