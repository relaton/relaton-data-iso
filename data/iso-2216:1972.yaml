  content: The principle of the method consists in determination of the Na2O content
    by treatment of an aqueous extract with an excess of hydrochloric acid solution,
    followed by back-titration with standard volumetric sodium hydroxide solution
    in the presence of methyl red as indicator. Subsequent titration of the boric
    oxide with standard volumetric sodium hydroxide solution in the presence of mannitol
    or sorbitol (the solution turns red; on titration with sodium hydroxide solution
    the colour of the solution changes to yellow and turns pink at the end point)
    and phenolphthalein as indicator to a distinct pink colour.
