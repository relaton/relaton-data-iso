  content: ISO/TS 16479:2012 determines the slow cracking resistance of pipes and
    fittings using the Notched Ring Test (NRT) which is a method for determining the
    slow crack resistance of thermoplastics resins and compounds in pipe form and/or
    finished products (e.g. pipes and fittings) from which a ring specimen can be
    cut and notched. The test is performed under sustained constant loading in a test
    medium at a specified temperature and the time to the on-set of slow cracking
    is measured. This method applies to the rings from pipes or fittings having a
    wall thickness greater than 5 mm. ISO/TS 16479:2012 specifies the method of testing
    using notched ring specimens directly obtained from pipes or fittings.
