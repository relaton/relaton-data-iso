  content: A series of solvent mixtures of gradually increasing surface tension are
    applied to the surface of the plastic form until a mixture is obtained that just
    wets the film surface. The wetting tension of the surface under test is approximated
    by the surface tension of this particular mixture. Any contamination of the film
    surface and any trace of surface active impurities may affect the wetting tension.
    Examples of test mixtures for the determination of the wetting tension are given
    in a table.
