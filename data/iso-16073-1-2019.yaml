    This document specifies the minimum performance requirements and methods of test for personal protective equipment (PPE) covering the torso, neck, arms, hands, legs, feet, head, eyes and hearing that is used for wildland firefighting.
    This document covers the general design of the PPE, the minimum levels of performance for the materials employed and the methods of test used. The PPE is not intended to provide protection during fire entrapment.
    This document does not cover PPE for structural firefighting (see ISO 11999 series), for use against chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear hazards, or for use where a reflective outer surface is required (see ISO 15538).
    Activities in support of wildland firefighting, such as the cutting of trees and the use of a chainsaw can require additional protection to that provided in this document. Users are directed to those relevant standards for the requirements associated with such protection.
    To assist with selection of the right PPE, a risk assessment (see Annex A) can be conducted to determine the type of PPE, and performance levels, for different categories of protection are required.
    This document describes performance requirements for PPE and includes requirements for marking and manufacturer's instructions.
