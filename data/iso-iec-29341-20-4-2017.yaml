  content: "ISO/IEC 29341-20-4:2017 defines the layout of the AV Datastructure Template
    (AVDT) XML document. An AVDT document describes the format requirements and restrictions
    of various data structures used within the UPnP AV specifications. Although these
    data structures are defined very precisely in the appropriate service specification,
    in most cases, each data structure definition allows for a certain degree of variation
    in order to accommodate differences between individual devices. \nThe purpose
    of an AVDT document is to enable each device to describe (at run-time) its particular
    variation of these AV data structures. AVDT documents allow users of AV data structures
    (e.g. UPnP control points) to reduce the number of instances of those data structures
    that comply with the service specification but are not compatible with the device's
    particular capabilities. The ultimate goal of an AVDT document is to reduce those
    error conditions that are caused by control points creating instances of a data
    structure that exceed the static (known) capabilities of the device. Unfortunately,
    the AVDT mechanism will never eliminate all preventable error conditions, but
    it will help to reduce them by giving the client more information about the device's
    particular capabilities. \nAs described above, an AVDT document is a machine readable,
    implementation-specific variant of an AV data structure defined by one of the
    UPnP AV specifications. For a given device, each instance of that data structure
    shall conform to both the specification definition and the device's AVDT definition
    of that data structure. \nIronically, an AVDT document is both a more-restrictive
    and more-permissive variant of the specification definition. AVDT documents are
    more restrictive because they limit certain aspects of the data structure (e.g.
    such as the allowed values for each field) that are otherwise permitted by the
    specification definition. However, due to limitations of the AVDT constructs,
    it is simply not possible to express some of the more intricate requirements defined
    by the specification (e.g. subtle interdependencies between data structure fields).
    Consequently, instances of a data structure that comply with a given AVDT description
    may not fully comply with all of the requirements defined in the specification.
    \nThe types of data structures that can be described by an AVDT document represent
    a (non-hierarchitical) set of named property values. The set of allowed property
    names and their allowed values for a given data structure are defined by one of
    the UPnP AV specifications. Individual instances of these data structures are
    manifested via an XML document whose elements and attributes correspond to the
    set of named properties. In other words, within the XML document that corresponds
    to a given instance of a certain data structure, each XML element and attribute
    contains the value of a specific named property. \nAn AVDT document is conceptually
    similar to an XML schema in that both entities identify the XML elements and attributes
    that appear in any given document instance. Additionally, both AVDT documents
    and XML schemas identify the allowed values that are permitted for each element
    and/or attribute which corresponds to a specific property. However, unlike an
    XML schema, an AVDT document can also identify certain dependencies between two
    or more properties. For example, the set of allowed values of one property may
    depend on the actual value of another property. This type of interrelationship
    is difficult to represent using an XML schema. Hence, the AVDTdocument structure
    is needed. \nIn the various AV Architecture scenarios, sometimes there is a need
    to exchange device capabilities to ensure high level interoperability. In order
    to express the parameterized capability, an AV specification defines various templates
    for each purpose. A device uses the template and populates it with values to reflect
    its capabilities at run-time. \nThe AV Datastructure Template (AVDT) is a common
    structure to define various templates, which are called \"Datastructure\". This
    is written in XML and each data structure uses a subset of the AVDT to meet the
    necessary requirement."
