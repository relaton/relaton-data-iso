    This International Standard specifies the supplementary service Simple Dialog (SS-SD), which is applicable to various basic
    services supported by Private Integrated Services Networks (PISNs). Basic services are specified in ISO/IEC 11574.
    Supplementary service SD enables a user to communicate with another user or application by the exchange of keypad and
    display information transparently over a PISN.
    Service specifications are produced in three stages, according to the method described in ETS 300 387. This International
    Standard contains the stage 1 and stage 2 specifications of SS-SD. The stage 1 specification (clause 6) specifies the
    supplementary service as seen by users of PISNs. The stage 2 specification (clause 7) specifies the functional entities involved
    in the supplementary service and the information flows between them.
