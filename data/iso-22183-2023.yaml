    This document specifies procedures for validation of high-speed tensile test data. It specifies a method to determine the spectrum of the natural oscillation frequencies of the force transducer and grip configuration of the high-speed tensile test equipment.
    The lowest significant frequency is used for the validation. This validation procedure only applies to force measurement systems used in high-speed tensile testing machines showing a level of resonance influence that could be critical to the obtained result. Once the relevant frequencies of the system and the anticipated strain for the given material are known, this method allows to calculate the theoretical maximum allowed test speed too.
