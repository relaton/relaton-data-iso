abstract:
- content: ISO 14620:2011 specifies requirements for the safety liabilities of countries
    undertaking space activities or allowing operators to perform space activities
    on or from their territory under outer space treaties adopted by the United Nations.
    It defines the safety responsibilities for the operators involved in commercial
    or non-commercial space launch activities. ISO 14620:2011 establishes the overall
    safety requirements to be observed on a launch site for prelaunch (integration,
    test, checking, preparation, etc.) and launch operations of a space object. It
    provides the basic principles to enable any operator to implement its own safety
    methods, tools, and procedures, to ensure the safety of people and personnel,
    public and private property, and the environment, in a consistent and uniform
    manner.
