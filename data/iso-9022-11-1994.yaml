  content: Specifies methods for the testing of optical instruments, instruments containing
    optical components, and materials for optical instruments, under equivalent conditions,
    for their ability to resist mould growth. The purpose of testing is to investigate
    to what extent the optical, chemical, mechanical and electrical performance characteristics
    are affected by mould growth. The tests described are designed for the selection
    of materials and components for the instruments. Complete instruments or assemblies
    are only tested in exceptional cases.
