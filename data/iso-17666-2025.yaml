    This document defines, extending the requirements of ISO 14300-1, the principles and requirements for integrated risk management on a space project. It explains what is needed to implement a project-integrated risk management policy by any project actor, at any level (i.e. customer, first-level supplier or lower-level suppliers).
    This document contains a summary of the general risk management process, which is subdivided into four basic steps and nine tasks. This document is applicable to all the space project phases, as defined in ISO 14300-1.
