  content: "ISO 19092-1:2006 describes the security framework for using biometrics
    for authentication of individuals in financial services. It introduces the types
    of biometric technologies and addresses issues concerning their application. ISO
    19092-1:2006 also describes the architectures for implementation, specifies the
    minimum security requirements for effective management, and provides control objectives
    and recommendations suitable for use by a professional practitioner. \nThe following
    are within the scope of ISO 19092-1:2006:\n- usage of biometrics for the authentication
    of employees and persons seeking financial services by:verification of a claimed
    identity;identification of an individual;\n- validation of credentials presented
    at enrolment to support authentication as required by risk management;\n- management
    of biometric information across its life cycle comprised of the enrolment, transmission
    and storage, verification, identification and termination processes;\n- security
    of biometric information during its life cycle, encompassing data integrity, origin
    authentication and confidentiality;\n- application of biometrics for logical and
    physical access control;\n- surveillance to protect the financial institution
    and its customers;\n- security of the physical hardware used throughout the biometric
    information life cycle.\nISO 19092-1:2006 provides the mandatory means whereby
    biometric information may be encrypted for data confidentiality or other reasons."
