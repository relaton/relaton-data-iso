    ISO/TR 10300-30:2017 provides sample calculations for different bevel gear designs, how the load capacity is numerically determined according to the methods and formulae of the ISO 10300 series. The initial geometric gear data necessary for these calculations in accordance with ISO 23509.
    The term "bevel gear" is used to mean straight, helical (skew), spiral bevel, zerol and hypoid gear designs. Where this document pertains to one or more, but not all, the specific forms are identified.
    The manufacturing process of forming the desired tooth form is not intended to imply any specific process, but rather to be general in nature and applicable to all calculation methods of the ISO 10300 series. The fact that there are bevel gear designs with tapered teeth and others where the tooth depth remains constant along the face width (uniform depth) does not demand to apply Method B2 for the first and Method B1 for the second tooth configuration.
    The rating system of the ISO 10300 series is based on virtual cylindrical gears and restricted to bevel gears whose virtual cylindrical gears have transverse contact ratios of εvα < 2. Additionally, the given relations are valid for bevel gears of which the sum of profile shift coefficients of pinion and wheel is zero (see ISO 23509).
