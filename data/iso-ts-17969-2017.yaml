    The purpose of ISO/TS 17969:2017 is to help members of the oil and gas industry develop, implement, maintain and improve their own competency management systems (CMS) for well operations personnel. ISO/TS 17969:2017 supports competency management general principles which can be applied to any operation within the industry.
    The annexes to ISO/TS 17969:2017 list example competence profiles for personnel responsible for well integrity. Annex A includes an example worksheet which can be used in performing a competency assessment, to help record the assessment results versus expectation, as well as the resulting action plan to address any gaps identified.
    ISO/TS 17969:2017 is applicable to all operators, service companies and drilling contractors working on wells and well operations.
