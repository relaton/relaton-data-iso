  content: "ISO/TR 14873:2013 defines statistics, terms and quality criteria for Web
    archiving. It considers the needs and practices across a wide range of organisations
    such as libraries, archives, museums, research centres and heritage foundations.
    \nISO/TR 14873:2013 is intended for professionals directly involved in Web archiving.
    It is also useful for Web archiving institutions' funding authorities and external
    stakeholders. The terminology used in ISO/TR 14873:2013 attempts to reflect the
    wide range of interests and expertise of the audiences, striking a balance between
    computer science, management and librarianship.\nISO/TR 14873:2013 essentially
    focuses on Web archiving principles and methods and does not encompass alternative
    ways of collecting Internet resources."
