- content: |-
    This document specifies an implementation architecture (IA) of CPSMT for implementing functional architecture (FA) given in ISO 23704-2 including
    - Implementation architecture for CPCM,
    - Implementation architecture for CSSM and
    - Interface architecture of CPSMT.
    This document provides an implementation guideline (IG) of CPSMT including
    - Information model of CPSMT for CPCM and CSSM,
    - Communication model of CPSMT for CPCM and CSSM,
    - Integration model of CPSMT and
    - Digitalization model of CPSMT.
    This document also includes use cases for CPCM, CSSM, UIS (Unified Interface System), SFDS (Shop Floor Device System), SFCS (Shop Floor Control System).
