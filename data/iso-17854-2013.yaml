    ISO 17854:2013 defines an efficient and comprehensive coding and modulation solution able to support a wide range of spectral efficiency values and data rates. The main target is given by high data rate telemetry applications, i.e. Earth Exploration Satellite Service (EESS) telemetry payload, where the increase of the system throughput by means of advanced adaptive techniques is deemed essential in order to fulfil the requirements imposed by future missions.
    ISO 17854:2013 presents a turbo-like coding/modulation scheme based on one possible realization of a Serial Concatenated Convolutional Code (SCCC). This scheme makes use of a set of a large variety of modulation techniques (including QPSK, 8PSK, 16APSK, 32APSK, and 64APSK) and a wide range of coding rates. The number of different modulation schemes available, combined with a properly selected coding rate, allows the overall system to make efficient use of the available bandwidth, adapting itself to the variable conditions of the link. The proposed scheme can implement Variable Coding and Modulation (VCM) mode, which varies the transmission scheme to the channel conditions following a predetermined schedule (for example, as a function of the elevation angle). When a channel is available to provide feedback (e.g. via Telecommand), the transmission scheme can be dynamically adjusted using the Adaptive Coding and Modulation (ACM) mode. The proposed coding scheme is easily adapted to any of the available modulation formats thanks to the pragmatic approach adopted: the outputs of the binary encoders are mapped to the considered modulation scheme, after being interleaved. In other words, a bit-interleaved coded modulation scheme is proposed.
    The use of SCCC is intended mainly for high data rate applications. The Forward Error Correction (FEC) scheme is based on the concatenation of two simple four-state encoder structures. The SCCC scheme implies a Physical Layer frame of constant length, with pilots inserted in fixed positions. This architecture simplifies the synchronization procedure, thus further allowing fast and efficient acquisition at very high rates for the receiver.
    ISO 17854:2013 describes a technique incorporating multiple modulation formats paired with a flexible coding and synchronization method in a tightly integrated fashion. In particular, ISO 17854:2013 provides a series of recommended formats where each format pairs a modulation technique with a tailored implementation of the coding and synchronization method. However, where these modulations and/or codes are recommended in other CCSDS documents, ISO 17854:2013 does not limit the choice of modulations and/or codes consistent with those recommendations.
