abstract:
- content: "This document describes four methods for the adjustment of the digital
    content data that is input to a printing system to achieve consistency in the
    printed results among a number of presses printing to the same general aim conditions.
    These four methods are generally identified as:\n1)       matching of tone value
    curves (TVI and CTV), \n2)       use of near-neutral scales, \n3)       colour-optimised
    correction curve set, and\n4)       use of CMYK to CMYK multi-dimensional transforms.\nThe
    procedures for establishing the aim condition for the necessary correction curves,
    the procedures for determining the individual correction curves, and a comparison
    of the applicability of these four methods are included.\nThese adjustment procedures
    are intended for use with printing systems that use CMYK colourants. Such systems
    are not restricted to those that use traditional ink on paper printing but can
    involve other marking technologies such as those used for proofing and/or digital
    printing."
