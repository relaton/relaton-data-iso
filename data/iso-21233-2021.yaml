abstract:
- content: This document specifies a method for comparing simulation results from
    a vehicle model to measured test data for an existing vehicle according to closing-curve
    tests as specified in ISO 11026. The purpose of the validation is to demonstrate
    that the vehicle dynamics simulation, combined with an integrated electronic stability
    control (ESC) system, can predict the roll and yaw stability behaviour of a physical
    vehicle, including the ESC system interventions, during a closing-curve test.
    The simulation method can be either hardware-in-the-loop [with the original electronic
    control unit (ECU) on a HiL test stand] or software-in-the-loop, based on a software
    code generated from the same source as for the ECU in the real vehicle. This document
    applies to heavy vehicles, including commercial vehicles, commercial vehicle combinations,
    buses and articulated buses as defined in ISO 3833 (trucks and trailers with a
    maximum weight above 3,5 tonnes and buses and articulated buses with a maximum
    weight above 5 tonnes, according to ECE and EC vehicle classification, categories
    M3, N2, N3, O3 and O4).
