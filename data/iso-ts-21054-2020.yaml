abstract:
- content: "This document defines design principles of accessibility for controls
    of consumer products, so that users from a population with the widest range of
    user needs, characteristics and capabilities are able to use controls to operate
    and control consumer products in the same manner and ease as users without disabilities.\nThis
    document is applicable to all kinds and types of consumer products. This document
    is applicable to the controls for common main operations of consumer products
    such as initiation, termination, and cancellation of operation, as well as for
    specified functions necessary for more detailed operations and fine adjustment.
    \nThis document does not deal with controls for some specialized devices intended
    only for specified user populations and tasks, e.g. assistive and medical devices.
    Each design consideration in this document is based on ergonomic principles that
    are necessary for making the controls of consumer products accessible to a wider
    range of users."
