  content: Cancels and replaces the first edition (1979). Specifies a method for determining
    the dryness of a lot of pulp baled in slabs and for calculating its saleable mass.
    Applicable for most kinds of pulp, in bales of approximately 200 kg, and made
    up of four to six slabs or wads, of fairly uniform and similar thickness. Also
    be applicable to bales not composed of individual layers, but which are naturally
    delaminateable. Not applicable to pulp baled in sheet form or in unitized bales,
    and, if the drilling device becomes appreciably hot because of frictional heat
    evolved during drilling.
