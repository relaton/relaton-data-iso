    The ISO 22067 series specifies requirements and criteria for communication of environmental aspects within the print production supply chain. This document specifies requirements for environmental communication on print production, including all processes and print components used for the production of the final printed materials. This document is applicable for most printing methods but excludes, due to their unique processing requirements, printing on textiles and ceramics.
    NOTE      Recognising established environmental communication, provision is made (see Clause 4) to permit communication of environmental information for paper, board or other substrates based on requirements and guidelines provided by standards organizations or industry bodies.
