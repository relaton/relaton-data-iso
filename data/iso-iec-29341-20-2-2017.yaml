abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 29341-20-2:2017 is compliant with the Universal Plug and Play
    Device Architecture version 1.0 [14]. It defines a device type referred to herein
    as MediaRenderer. \nThe MediaRenderer specification defines a general-purpose
    device template that can be used to instantiate any Consumer Electronics (CE)
    device that is capable of rendering AV content from the home network. It exposes
    a set of rendering controls in which a control point can control how the specified
    AV content is rendered. This includes controlling various rendering features such
    as brightness, contrast, volume, etc. \nExample instances of a MediaRenderer include
    traditional devices such as TVs and stereo systems. Some more contemporary examples
    include digital devices such as MP3 players and Electronic Picture Frames (EPFs).
    Although most of these examples typically render one specific type of content
    (for example, a TV typically renders video content), a MediaRenderer is able to
    support a number of different data formats and transfer protocols. For example,
    a sophisticated implementation of a TV MediaRenderer could also support MP3 data
    so that its speakers could be used to play MP3 audio content. \nThe MediaRenderer
    device specification is very lightweight and is easy to implement on low-resource
    devices such as an MP3 player. However, it can also be used to expose the high-end
    capabilities of devices such as a PC."
