    ISO 23499:2008 provides description of a cone procedure for determining an uncompacted bulk density of crushed coal less than 37 mm in size, such as is charged into coke ovens. It focuses on the uncompacted bulk density of coal resulting from flowing the material into a measuring container (box) in the absence of compacting forces.
    ISO 23499:2008 does not cover procedures for determining a compacted coal bulk density nor to the testing of fine or powdered coal (for boiler or utility application) nor to the determination of bulk density of coal in storage piles.
