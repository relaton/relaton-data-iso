  content: "This document lists examples of and defines categories of use cases for
    machine learning in medicine for clinical practice. \nThe developments and applications
    of machine learning technologies for artificial intelligence consist of 1) data
    collection and curation, 2) pre-processing, 3) model training and validation,
    and 4) medicine depending on various kinds of specialty including radiology, pathology,
    emergency medicine, dermatology, ophthalmology, anaesthesia, surgery, etc., and
    clinical settings including repeated detection and/or diagnosis, real-time monitoring,
    and treatment prediction.\nThis document covers categories applications of medicine
    in (4). It also defines the clinical usages and necessities of the artificial
    intelligence in medicine. \n(1) to (3) are not the scope of this document\nThis
    document also excludes\n—     basic research and other scientific areas,\n—     use
    cases related to artificial intelligence methods other than machine learning (for
    example, symbolic artificial intelligence, expert systems), and\n—     non-human
    results such as veterinary medicine."
