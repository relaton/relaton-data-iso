    This document addresses power supplies to, and power distribution within, data centres based upon the criteria and classifications for “availability”, “physical security” and “energy efficiency enablement” within ISO/IEC 22237‑1.
    This document specifies requirements and recommendations for the following:
    a) power supplies to data centres;
    b) power distribution systems to all equipment within data centres;
    c) telecommunications infrastructure bonding;
    d) lightning protection;
    e) devices for the measurement of the power consumption and power quality characteristics at points along the power distribution system and their integration within management tools.
    Safety and electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) requirements are outside the scope of this document and are covered by other standards and regulations. However, information given in this document can be of assistance in meeting these standards and regulations.
    Conformance of data centres to the present document is covered in Clause 4.
    The use of the data centre stored energy or alternate sources to be used by the grid is not in the scope of this document and is for consideration in future specifications.
