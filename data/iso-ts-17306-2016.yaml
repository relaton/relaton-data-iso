    ISO/TS 17306:2016 establishes a methodology for quantitative determination of free glycerol, mono-, di-, triacylglycerols and total glycerol by gas chromatography in biodiesel produced from any raw material including coconut or palm oil and animal fat. It is not applicable for biodiesel from castor oil.
    In most actual cases, biodiesel is based on fatty acid methyl esters (FAME). These have also been used during the precision study for this test method. There is no indication that the methodology does not apply to other ester types, but the precision has not been determined nor compared.
    NOTE          For the purposes of this Technical Specification, the term "% (m/m)" is used to represent the mass fraction, µ.
