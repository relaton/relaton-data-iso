abstract:
- content: "This International Standard proposal specifies technical requirements
    and evaluation method for temperature correction on temperature measurement in
    radiosonde due to solar radiation in sounding experiment. This International Standard
    is applicable to the correction of temperature measurement traceable to SI unit
    in radiosonde boom sensors according to variations of pressure and air speed under
    the simulated conditions of upper air. \n\nThis proposed standard will mainly
    provide \nTerms and definitions\nTechnical specification for test instrumentations.\nTest
    procedure of solar correction according to pressure and air speed. \nUncertainty
    evaluation of the test procedures."
