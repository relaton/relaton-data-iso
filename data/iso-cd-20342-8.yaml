abstract:
- content: "This document characterizes the ability of an APTI to redistribute the
    pressure to support the user load during periods of lying down. This document
    applies to active and reactive products. It covers standard methods of testing,
    reporting results and the clinical relevance of these results.\n\nNOTE \tPressure
    redistribution is recognized as a critical factor in the prevention and treatment
    of pressure injuries."
