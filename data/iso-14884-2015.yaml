    ISO 14884:2015 specifies technical requirements for weathertight hinged, sliding, and pantograph doors for manual and powered operation providing access to accommodation and service areas on large yachts, taking into account the location of the appliance.
    This International Standard only considers design loads applied to the door and transmitted into the frame and the adjacent structure. Loads imparted from the yacht's structure into the door or in its associated frame are not considered in this International Standard.
    Unframed glazed doors are outside the scope of this International Standard.
    Forward facing multi-leaf doors on the weather deck are outside the scope of this International Standard.
    Large yachts are of L greater than or equal to 24 m, in use for sport or pleasure and commercial operations.
    The appliances considered in this International Standard are primarily those that are intended to achieve weathertightness as required by International Convention on Load Lines 1966 as amended by the Protocol of 1988 (ICLL), (i.e. those fitted in position 1 and position 2) as defined in this regulation.
    NOTE          This International Standard is based on the experience of ship door, window, and glass manufacturers, shipbuilders, and authorities who apply to ships the regulations of the ICLL, noting the provisions of Article 8 "equivalents", as agreed by the appropriate marine administration
