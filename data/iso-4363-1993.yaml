  script: Latn
  content: Specifies methods for detailed measurement of sediment concentration and
    also methods for routine sampling. Because sediment load is highly variable with
    stage and is also highly variable at the same stage in different floods, and because
    the bulk of sediment is carried in flood periods, accurate computation of total
    sediment flow in a period entails routine sampling at normal flows combined with
    frequent routine sampling on rise, peak and fall in floods.
