    This document provides a common approach and guidance to those undertaking assessment of the major safety hazards as part of the planning, design, and operation of LNG facilities onshore and at shoreline using risk-based methods and standards, to enable a safe design and operation of LNG facilities. The environmental risks associated with an LNG release are not addressed in this document.
    This document is applicable both to export and import terminals but can be applicable to other facilities such as satellite and peak shaving plants.
    This document is applicable to all facilities inside the perimeter of the terminal and all hazardous materials including LNG and associated products: LPG, pressurized natural gas, odorizers, and other flammable or hazardous products handled within the terminal.
    The navigation risks and LNG tanker intrinsic operation risks are recognised, but they are not in the scope of this document. Hazards arising from interfaces between port and facility and ship are addressed and requirements are normally given by port authorities. It is assumed that LNG carriers are designed according to the IGC code, and that LNG fuelled vessels receiving bunker fuel are designed according to IGF code.
    Border between port operation and LNG facility is when the ship/shore link (SSL) is established.
    This document is not intended to specify acceptable levels of risk; however, examples of tolerable levels of risk are referenced.
    See IEC 31010 and ISO 17776 with regard to general risk assessment methods, while this document focuses on the specific needs scenarios and practices within the LNG industry.
