  content: Applicable to Fe contents of equal to or more than 0.0001 % (m/m). The
    reaction bases on the reduction of iron(III) by hydroxylammonium chloride. Formation
    of the complex between iron(II) and 2,2'-dipyridyl in a buffered medium (pH value
    between 4.5 and 6). Photometric measurement of the coloured complex at a wavelength
    of about 522 nm. Has also been approved by the IUPAC.
