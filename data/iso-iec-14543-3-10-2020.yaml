abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 14543-3-10:2020(E) specifies a wireless protocol for low-powered
    devices such as energy harvesting devices in a home environment. This wireless
    protocol is specifically designed to keep the energy consumption of such sensors
    and switches extremely low.\nThe design is characterized by\n\x95 keeping the
    communications very short, infrequent and mostly unidirectional, and\n\x95 using
    communication frequencies that provide a good range even at low transmit power
    and avoid collisions from disturbers.\nThis allows the use of small and low-cost
    energy harvesting devices that can compete with similar battery-powered devices.
    The messages sent by energy harvesting devices are received and processed mainly
    by line-powered devices such as relay switch actuators, repeaters or gateways.
    Together these form part of a home automation system, which, when conforming to
    ISO/IEC 14543 (all parts), is defined as a home electronic system.\nThis document
    specifies OSI Layers 1 to 3 of the amplitude modulated wireless short-packet (AMWSP)
    protocols.\nThe AMWSP protocol system consists of two and optionally three types
    of components that are specified in this document. These are the transmitter,
    the receiver and optionally the repeater. Repeaters are needed when the transmitter
    and the receiver are located in such a way that no good direct communication between
    them can be established.\nProtection against malicious attacks is handled in the
    upper layers and thus not treated in this document."
