    This document provides insights into the essential aspects of CO2 shipping and provides basic descriptions of how the CO2 carrier and technology therein is technically integrated with the CCS value chain. It also includes a description of specific challenges of transporting CO2 as cargo, how this differs from other gases transported by ships today, and how this influences the ship design and operation. Finally, this document introduces how CO2 ships are regulated within the existing international maritime regulatory framework. This document's main focus is on the technical aspects of CO2 shipping. Commercial, liability and financial aspects are intentionally kept out of this document. However, general reference to commercial impact is made where relevant.
    This document focuses on the ship transportation of CO2 between loading and offloading facilities where the system boundaries are at the ship manifold equipment that connects the ship to the other components in the value chain. In the document, the basis for the description of ship operation is transportation between two shore-based terminals. A high-level description of other relevant interfaces is given on a conceptual level as this has impact on the ship design. However, any further description of potential solutions upstream and downstream from the CO2 carrier is outside the scope. This document also gives a high-level description of the physical properties of CO2 streams at the conditions relevant for shipping and how relevant impurities can impact the ship and ship operation.
