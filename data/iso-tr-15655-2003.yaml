abstract:
- content: "ISO/TR 15655:2003 identifies test methods already in existence and provides
    guidance on those that need to be developed to characterize the thermo-physical
    and mechanical properties of structural materials at elevated temperatures for
    use in fire safety engineering calculations. \nIt is applicable to materials used
    in load-bearing construction in which structural and thermal calculations might
    be required to assess the performance of elements or systems exposed to either
    standard fire tests, real or design fire heating conditions\nIt is recognized
    that the elevated temperature properties of materials can be determined under
    a variety of conditions. Since fire is a relatively short transient process lasting
    from a few minutes to several hours, ideally, the properties determined should
    reflect the transient thermal and loading conditions as well as the duration of
    heating that may be experienced in practice. However, it is also recognized that
    some properties are relatively insensitive to the transient conditions and therefore,
    alternative steady state test methods may be appropriate. Some properties are
    sensitive to orientation effects, for example timber, and these should be considered
    with respect to how the tests are conducted. \nIn cases where materials undergo
    either a chemical or a physical reaction during the heating process, it might
    be impossible to determine an individual property. ISO/TR 15655:2003 gives guidance
    in selecting a test method to determine an effective value representing a combination
    of properties. It is also recognized that a test specimen may comprise of a small
    construction such as that used in the testing of masonry. This often involves
    building a mini assembly to form a pyramid in order to represent the true behaviour.
    \nApart from the traditional construction materials such as metals, concrete,
    masonry and wood, the use of plastics and fibre reinforcement is becoming more
    common. Therefore these materials have also been included in ISO/TR 15655:2003
    to reflect possible future changes in design and advances in materials technology.\nIn
    the past, the behaviour of jointing systems in fire has only received a little
    interest yet their behaviour is fundamental to the performance of composite elements
    and structural frames. ISO/TR 15655:2003 also addresses jointing systems under
    individual materials, for example welds for steel, glues for timber, they are
    considered in that section. However, in many cases the end use of an adhesive
    is not clear or it covers a range of applications. For this reason a separate
    category for adhesives is included.\nFor some materials, it has not been possible
    to identify an existing standard or laboratory procedure for conducting tests
    at elevated temperatures under either steady state or, transient heating conditions.
    In these cases, standards for conducting tests at ambient temperature are identified.
    These may be considered to form the basis for development into a test method suitable
    at elevated temperatures."
