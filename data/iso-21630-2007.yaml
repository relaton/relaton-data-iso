abstract:
- content: "ISO 21630:2007 prescribes acceptance test methods for submersible mixers
    used for mixing in wastewater and other applications where at least one system
    component is a liquid. \n\"Submersible mixer\" is taken to mean a fully submersible
    aggregate consisting of a drive unit and an axial flow type impeller, and optional
    parts, such as shrouds, supporting the basic functions. \n\"Liquid\" is taken
    to mean a body without capacity to accommodate shear stresses when at rest. This
    includes suspensions and dispersions (liquid/solid, gas/liquid and gas/liquid/solid),
    and non-Newtonian liquids, provided that a possible small yield stress does not
    prevent the liquid from flowing when agitated."
