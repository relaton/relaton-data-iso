  content: "This European standard specifies a method for the measurement of effective
    focal spot dimensions above 0,1 µm of X-ray systems by means of the edge method
    applied to digital images taken from hole type or disk type gauges. The imaging
    quality and the resolution of X-ray images depend highly on the characteristics
    of the effective focal spot, in particular the size and the two-dimensional intensity
    distribution as seen from the detector plane. \nThis document provides instructions
    for determining the effective size (dimensions) of standard, mini and micro focal
    spots of industrial X-ray tubes for users in applications where the pin hole method
    of EN12543-2 is not practicable. This determination is based on the measurement
    of a profile of an image of a hole or disk type gauge.\nThe method as described
    in this document can be used for long term monitoring of focal spot sizes without
    a pin hole camera.  \nThe accuracy of this method is lower than the one of ISO
    32543-1 (EN 12543-2), ISO/NP 32543-3 (EN 12543-5) and ISO/NP 32543-4 (future EN
    12543-6), using ASTM hole plate IQIs (ASTM E 1025, E 1742), due to its manufacturer
    tolerance of 10%."
