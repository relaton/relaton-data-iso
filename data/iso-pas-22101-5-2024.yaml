    This document specifies the requirements of the fitness for purpose of pipes or fittings assemblies or both made from short glass fibre reinforced polyethylene (PE-sGF) piping systems manufactured by the spiral cross winding method used below ground for the conveyance of fluids in the following industrial and agricultural contexts:
    —     chemical plants;
    —     industrial sewerage engineering;
    —     power engineering (cooling and general-purpose water supply);
    —     agricultural production plants;
    —     water treatment;
    —     small hydraulic power plants (general-purpose water supply).
    This document also specifies the test parameters for the test methods it references.
    In conjunction with other parts of the ISO 22101 series, this document is applicable to PE-sGF pipes, fittings, their joints and joints with components of PE-sGF or other materials, intended to be used under the following conditions:
    a)       a maximum allowable operating pressure (PFA) up to and including 25 bar;1)
    b)       operating temperature of 20 °C as the reference temperature.
    NOTE            For other operating temperatures, guidance is given in ISO/PAS 22101-1:2022, Annex A.
    This document is applicable to pipes with an inside diameter of 200 mm to 1 000 mm with integrated socket and spigot fusion joint.
