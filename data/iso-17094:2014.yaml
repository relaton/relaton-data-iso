- content: |-
    ISO 17094:2014 presents a test method for determining the antibacterial activity of materials that contain an indoor-light-active photocatalytic material or have indoor-light-active photocatalytic films on the surface by measuring the survival of bacteria after illumination with indoor light.
    It is intended for use with different kinds of indoor-light-active photocatalytic materials used in construction materials in flat sheet, board or plate shape that are the basic forms of materials for various applications. It does not include powder, granular, or porous indoor-light-active photocatalytic materials, nor is it applicable to cloth or textiles.
    It is applicable to indoor-light-active photocatalytic materials produced for antibacterial application. Other types of performance of indoor-light-active photocatalytic materials, i.e. decomposition of water contaminants, self-cleaning, antifogging, and air purification, cannot be determined by this method.
