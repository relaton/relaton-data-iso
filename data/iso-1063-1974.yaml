  content: Solutions of the substance to be tested in differing concentrations are
    mixed with hard water solutions of differing known calcium hardness. After leaving
    the solutions to stand in specified conditions their appearance, i.e. clearness,
    opalescence, cloudiness or precipitation is observed. The method is applicable
    to surface active agents soluble in water at 20 °C. It can be extended to those
    which are soluble at approximately 50 °C.
