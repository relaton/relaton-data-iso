    ISO 8533:2003 specifies methods of test for cemented or wrapped joints for plastics piping systems made of glass-reinforced thermosetting plastics (GRP) for buried and non-buried pipelines. This standard is only applicable to the joint and covers methods of test to prove its design. It assumes that the joint either is or is not intended to be subject to the effects of hydrostatic end thrust.
    The tests are applicable to cemented or wrapped joints intended to be used in either buried or non-buried applications. The bending tests can be used to prove the design where joints are either intended to be used in buried applications or are intended to be used in particular above-ground situations where the tests may be considered appropriate.
    With the exception of the bending tests, these test procedures are applicable to joints between pipes and fittings of all nominal sizes. The bending tests are applicable to joints between pipes and fittings up to and including DN 600. The tests are applicable to the evaluation of joints intended for the conveyance of liquids at temperatures specified in the referring standards.
