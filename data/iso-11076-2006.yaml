    ISO 11076:2006 establishes the minimum requirements for aircraft de-icing/anti-icing methods on the ground, in accordance with the ICAO Manual of aircraft ground de-icing/anti-icing operations and relevant national regulations, to facilitate the safe operation of transport aircraft during icing conditions. This International Standard does not specify requirements for specific aircraft model types.
    Frost, ice or snow deposits, which can seriously affect the aerodynamic performance and/or controllability of an aircraft, are effectively removed by the application of the procedures specified in ISO 11076:2006.
    De-icing/anti-icing by mechanical means is not covered by this International Standard.
