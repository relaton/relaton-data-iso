    This document specifies the following elements for cooperative telematics applications for regulated commercial freight vehicles directly communicating via a secure vehicle interface:
    a)       a framework for the provision of cooperative telematics application services for regulated commercial freight vehicles;
    b)       a description of the concept of operation, regulatory aspects and options and the role models;
    c)        a conceptual architecture using an on-board platform and wireless communications to a regulator or their agent;
    d)       references for the key documents on which the architecture is based;
    e)       the architecture of the facilities layer;
    f)         a taxonomy of the organization of generic procedures.
    This document does not replace, but is complementary to ISO 15638-1. It provides an alternative communication architecture for achieving similar service provision by means of a standardized secure vehicle interface.
