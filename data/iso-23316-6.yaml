    This document specifies the communication interface, so that the transmitted parameters, signals and objects between a supply system (SS), with power converter/switch (PC/S) and high power interface – master control (HPI-MC) including the tractor implement management (TIM) server, and a consumer system (CS), with application (APP) and high power interface – control (HPI-C) including the TIM client and the task controller, can be used is in the agricultural industry. The mentioned signals are used during identification, initialization, operation, and shutdown modes of operation.
    This document does not cover the definitions of suspect parameter numbers (SPNs) for the signals, within the parameter group numbers (PGNs) for messages and the message setup. These definitions are given in ISO 11783 and SAE J1939.
    NOTE            For information on messages (PGNs) see also Annex B.
