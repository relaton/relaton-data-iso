    This document specifies the design, minimum safety requirements, and inspection and testing procedures for liquefied hydrogen (LH2) marine transfer arms intended for use at onshore LH2 terminals handling LH2 carriers. It also covers the minimum requirements for safe LH2 transfer between ship and shore.
    Although the requirements for power/control systems are covered, this document does not include all of the details for the design and fabrication of standard parts and fittings associated with transfer arms. This document is mainly focused on hard pipe type transfer systems; hose type transfer systems are not described in detail in the general description of this document. However, hose type transfer systems can also be considered as reasonable vacuum insulated technology for the design of transfer arms for liquefied hydrogen.
