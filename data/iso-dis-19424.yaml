abstract:
- content: "This standard specifies requirements for the thermal and energy performance
    of refrigerated food lockers, in given environmental conditions and intended for
    the temporary cold storage of chilled or frozen pre-ordered or pre-selected foodstuff
    until the final collection by the consumer.\nThe standard also covers construction
    characteristics relevant for the thermal and energy performance.\nThis standards
    specifies tests conditions and methods for checking the requirements to be satisfied,
