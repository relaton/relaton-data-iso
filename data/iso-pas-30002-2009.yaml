abstract:
- content: "ISO/PAS 30002:2009 provides guidance which a shipowner should follow when
    selecting a ship recycling facility.\nIn order to ensure as far as possible that
    vessels are recycled in a safe and environmentally sound manner, shipowners should
    carefully consider ship recycling facilities to which they wish to sell their
    ships, and it is therefore important that ship recycling facilities provide certain
    objective information to assist in this selection process. Ship recycling facilities
    that are unwilling to provide this information on request by the shipowner should
    therefore not be considered.\nSince the shipowner may not be able to verify the
    information given, it is the sole responsibility of the ship recycling facilities
    to ensure that it is correct. However, it is important that shipowners be critical
    in their consideration of any such information, and should not consider facilities
    that publish obviously false information, or those where other data make it apparent
    that the information supplied does not reflect reality.\nISO/PAS 30002:2009 applies
    to the process of selecting ship recycling facility and the use of pro forma contract
    only and does not consider other aspects of ship recycling. Such aspects are covered
    by other standards of the ISO 30000 series. \nISO/PAS 30002:2009 is applicable
    to any shipowner who wishes to:\nIt is intended to be used by shipowners when
    selecting a ship recycling facility as guidelines only."
