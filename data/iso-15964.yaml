  content: This standard specifies 'safety and quality' requirements for detection
    and avoidance (DAA) systems used between UAS and other objects including aircraft.
    The standard includes the requirements of radar and optical sensors used for DAA
    and was derived to meet the requirements for UAS operations involving DAA set
    out in ISO 21384-3.
