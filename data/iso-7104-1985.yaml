  content: The water present in a sample is tranformed into acetylene by reaction
    with calcium carbide. The acetylene formed is determined by gas chromatography
    using an external standard consisting of a standard gas mixture with an inert
    gas, containing a known amount of acetylene. The method is applicable to products
    having water contents between 5 mg/kg and 3000 mg/kg.
