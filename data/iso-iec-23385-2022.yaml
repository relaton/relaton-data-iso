  content: This document specifies a method for measuring single photo printing time
    of digital photo printing devices on a wide range of print technologies. This
    document is applicable to digital photo printing devices that can produce photo
    prints on either 2” × 3” (51 mm × 76 mm), L (89 mm × 127 mm), 4” × 6” (102 mm
    × 152 mm), A6 (105 mm × 148 mm), A4 (210 mm × 297 mm), 8,5” × 11” (215,9 mm ×
    279,4 mm), 11” × 17” (279,4 mm × 431,8 mm), A3 (297 mm × 420 mm) or A3+ size sheets.
    Devices can be connected to either the computer system, media card or mobile devices.
    This document includes test setup procedure, test runtime procedure and reporting
    requirements for the digital single photo printing time measurements. Instant
    photoprint systems, which do not complete image formation at the time of paper
    ejection from device, are out of the scope of this document.
