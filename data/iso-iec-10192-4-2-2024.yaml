abstract:
- content: This document specifies a control architecture, user interface, and service
    objects in the HES gateway to enable interworking among home cluster systems and
    interoperability among the applications supported by these cluster systems. The
    ISO/IEC 10192 series specifies a common user interface to these cluster-system
    applications. This common user interface provides input and output methods for
    user information exchange to access, monitor, control and coordinate applications
    running on home cluster systems. This document specifies the application object,
    service and interface modules from the interoperability standard (ISO/IEC 18012
    series) necessary for interworking and incorporation of these modules in the HES
    gateway (ISO/IEC 15045 series).
