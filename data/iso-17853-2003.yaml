abstract:
- content: "ISO 17853:2003 specifies methods for sampling wear debris generated by
    total joint prostheses in humans and in joint simulators. It specifies the apparatus,
    reagents and test methods to isolate, characterize and quantify both polymer and
    metal wear debris from samples of tissue excised from around the joint prosthesis,
    obtained at revision surgery or post mortem, and from samples of joint-simulator
    test fluids.\nThe method given in ISO 17853:2003 does not quantify the level of
    wear the implant produces, nor does it determine the amount of wear from any particular
    surface. ISO 17853:2003 does not cover the biological effect of wear debris or
    provide a method for evaluation of biological safety. \nThe method given in ISO
    17853:2003 is not applicable to the measurement of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA)
    debris."
