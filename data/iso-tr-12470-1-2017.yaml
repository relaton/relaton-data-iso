    This document explains a methodology to determine the applicability of the results of fire resistance tests to actual applications.
    It is applicable to those loadbearing and simple vertical and horizontal separating elements for which there is an ISO standard test procedure based upon the ISO 834 series for determining the fire resistance of a representative sample of the construction proposed for use in a specific building or just for general use. These elements are:
    —    loadbearing elements;
    —    non-loadbearing elements:
    —    partitions:
    —    stud construction partitions;
    —    composite panel/SIPS partitions;
    —    ceiling membranes (horizontal partitions):
    —    jointed ceilings;
    —    composite panel ceilings.
    Direct and extended applications of test results are the two possible ways to ensure that a modified element has an acceptable probability of obtaining the same fire rating as that of the original tested specimen. In both cases, these applications generally refer only to the fire rating that the building element can expect to reach if it, or a representative sample of it, were to be tested in a furnace according to the standard fire test conditions used in the reference test.
    One of the most common variations is in respect of the size of the element in use. Fire resistance testing furnaces have size restrictions and as a consequence, there is little confidence that the result obtained on an element of construction tested in accordance with the standard methods will behave in a similar manner when installed in the final building.
    This document does not provide guidance on the application and extension of results arising from testing carried out on door and window assemblies, linear gaps or service penetration seals, which is covered in ISO/TR 12470-2.
    For some, but not all of the critical parameters, a summary of the possible influences is incorporated in the given examples.
