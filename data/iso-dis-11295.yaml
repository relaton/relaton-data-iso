abstract:
- content: "This document specifies the steps of the overall process of pipeline rehabilitation,
    comprising:\n—\tinformation on strategic and tactical activities:\na)\tinvestigation
    and condition assessment of the existing pipeline;\nb)\tpipeline rehabilitation
    planning.\n—\tinformation on and requirements for operational activities:\nc)\tproject
    specification;\nd)\tapplications of techniques;\ne)\tdocumentation of the design
    and application process.\nDefinitions and classification of families of renovation
    and trenchless replacement techniques are provided, and their respective features
    described. Areas of application covered include underground drainage and sewerage
    networks and underground water and gas supply networks.\nThe following aspects
    are not covered by the scope of this document:\n—\tnew construction provided as
    network extensions;\n—\tcalculation methods to determine, for each viable technique,
    the characteristics of lining or replacement pipe material needed to secure the
    desired performance of the rehabilitated pipeline;\n—\ttechniques providing non-structural
    pressure pipe liners;\n—\ttechniques for local repair.\nIt is the responsibility
    of the designer to choose and design the renovation or trenchless replacement
    pipeline system."
