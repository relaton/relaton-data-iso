    This part of ISO 26622 specifies the dimensions for modular taper interface with ball track system:
    tapered shanks for automatic and manual tool exchange to be applied on machine tools (e.g. lathe machines,
    drilling machines, milling machines and turn/milling machine centres). A range of shank sizes is specified, with
    details of the coolant-sealing O-ring being given in Annex A. The shank incorporates a flange with a groove to enable automatic tool exchange. The tools can also be exchanged manually. The clamping of the shank can be realized by the use of locking balls of a standard size and by a variety of mechanisms.
