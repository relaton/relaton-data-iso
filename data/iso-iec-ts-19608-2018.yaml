    This document provides guidance for:
    —          selecting and specifying security functional requirements (SFRs) from ISO/IEC 15408-2 to protect Personally Identifiable Information (PII);
    —          the procedure to define both privacy and security functional requirements in a coordinated manner; and
    —          developing privacy functional requirements as extended components based on the privacy principles defined in ISO/IEC 29100 through the paradigm described in ISO/IEC 15408-2.
    The intended audience for this document are:
    —          developers who implement products or systems that deal with PII and want to undergo a security evaluation of those products using ISO/IEC 15408. They will get guidance how to select security functional requirements for the Security Target of their product or system that map to the privacy principles defined in ISO/IEC 29100;
    —          authors of Protection Profiles that address the protection of PII; and
    —          evaluators that use ISO/IEC 15408 and ISO/IEC 18045 for a security evaluation.
    This document is intended to be fully consistent with ISO/IEC 15408; however, in the event of any inconsistency between this document and ISO/IEC 15408, the latter, as a normative standard, takes precedence.
