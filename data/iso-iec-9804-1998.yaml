    This Recommendation | International Standard is intended for reference by other specifications when the functionality of
    commitment, concurrency and recovery is required. It can be referenced whenever the processing of two or more
    application-entity invocations in a distributed application needs to be organized into an atomic action.
    This Recommendation | International Standard defines services that are used on a single association to coordinate two
    application-entity invocations involved in an atomic action. The determination of which application-entity invocations
    are involved in an atomic action is not within the scope of this Recommendation | International Standard.
    This Recommendation | International Standard establishes the general principles for the coordinated use of the CCR
    services when more than two application-entity invocations are involved in a single atomic action, or when recovery is
    required after failure. The coordination of multiple associations and the related application-entity invocations that
    constitute an atomic action is achieved by a referencing specification in conjunction with this Recommendation |
    International Standard.
    This Recommendation | International Standard is only applicable to a distributed application whose specification
    references this Recommendation | International Standard.
    This Recommendation | International Standard does not specify individual implementations or products. It does not
    constrain the implementation of entities and interfaces within a computer system.
    No requirement is made for conformance to this Recommendation | International Standard.
    This Recommendation | International Standard includes requirements for compliance that apply to a referencing
    specification.
    The CCR service defined in this Recommendation | International Standard requires that CCR Protocol Version 2 (or a
    later version) is being used.
