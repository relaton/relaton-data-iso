abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 19792:2009 specifies the subjects to be addressed during a security
    evaluation of a biometric system.\nIt covers the biometric-specific aspects and
    principles to be considered during the security evaluation of a biometric system.
    It does not address the non-biometric aspects which might form part of the overall
    security evaluation of a system using biometric technology (e.g. requirements
    on databases or communication channels). \nISO/IEC 19792:2009 does not aim to
    define any concrete methodology for the security evaluation of biometric systems
    but instead focuses on the principal requirements. As such, the requirements in
    ISO/IEC 19792:2009 are independent of any evaluation or certification scheme and
    will need to be incorporated into and adapted before being used in the context
    of a concrete scheme.\nISO/IEC 19792:2009 defines various areas that are important
    to be considered during a security evaluation of a biometric system.\nISO/IEC
    19792:2009 is relevant to both evaluator and developer communities.\n- It specifies
    requirements for evaluators and provides guidance on performing a security evaluation
    of a biometric system.\n- It serves to inform developers of the requirements for
    biometric security evaluations to help them prepare for security evaluations.\nAlthough
    ISO/IEC 19792:2009 is independent of any specific evaluation scheme it could serve
    as a framework for the development of concrete evaluation and testing methodologies
    to integrate the requirements for biometric evaluations into existing evaluation
    and certification schemes. "
