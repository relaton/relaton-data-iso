abstract:
- content: The aim of ISO 24617-4:2014 is to propose a consensual annotation scheme
    for semantic roles; that is to say, a scheme that indicates the role that a participant
    plays in an event or state, as described mostly by a verb, and typically providing
    answers to questions such as "?who' did ?what' to ?whom'", and ?when', ?where',
    ?why', and ?how'. This includes not only the semantic relations between a verb
    and its arguments but also those relations that are relevant for other predicative
    elements such as nominalizations, nouns, adjectives, and predicate modifiers;
    the predicating role of adverbs and the use of coercion fall outside the scope
    of ISO 24617-4:2014.
