    This document specifies the test method to determine the open-hole compressive strength of laminated fibre-reinforced plastic composites. The laminate is intended to be a balanced and symmetrical lay-up or be otherwise homogeneous through the thickness. This document applies to all textile diameter fibre types (carbon, glass, aramids, etc.) and matrices (e.g. thermoset, thermoplastic) that meet the requirements of this document.
    This document includes three methods:
    —     method 1 (short specimen with support fixture);
    —     method 2 (short specimen without support fixture);
    —     method 3 (long specimen with support fixture as in ASTM D6484/D6484M-09, methods A and B).
    Method 1 employs an L-shaped base fixture and two end fixtures. These end fixtures are compressed between the platens of the test machine.
    Method 2 employs end supports similar to the fixtures given in ISO 14126:2023, D.1. This method is useful for cyclic loading conditions test, including under fully or partly reversed loading conditions when the specimen is clamped by hydraulic grips without support fixtures
    Method 3 has two types of loading methods, i.e. 3A and 3B. In method 3A, the specimen is placed within a stabilization fixture, which is then clamped by hydraulic grips. In method 3B, the specimen is placed within a stabilization fixture and then end-loaded by platens. Full details of test methods 3A and 3B are given in ASTM D6484/D6484M-09, procedure A and procedure B, respectively.
    NOTE            Specimen configurations and force introduction varies for the three methods covered within this document. Results obtained using methods 1, 2 and 3 might not be equivalent for all laminates in all environments.
