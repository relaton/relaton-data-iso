abstract:
- content: "ISO/TS 23081-2:2007 establishes a framework for defining metadata elements
    consistent with the principles and implementation considerations outlined in ISO
    23081-1:2006. The purpose of this framework is to:\n- enable standardized description
    of records and critical contextual entities for records,\n- provide common understanding
    of fixed points of aggregation to enable interoperability of records, and information
    relevant to records, between organizational systems,\n- enable re-use and standardization
    of metadata for managing records over time, space and applications.\nIt further
    identifies some of the critical decision points that need to be addressed and
    documented to enable implementation of metadata for managing records. It aims
    to:\n- identify the issues that need to be addressed in implementing metadata
    for managing records, \n- identify and explain the various options for addressing
    the issues, and\n- identify various paths for making decisions and choosing options
    in implementing metadata for managing records. "
