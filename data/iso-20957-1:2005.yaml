    ISO 20957-1:2005 specifies general safety requirements for stationary training equipment during its use, unless modified in other parts of ISO 20957. It also specifies a classification system.
    ISO 20957-1:2005 is applicable to stationary training equipment including equipment for use in training areas of organizations such as sport associations, educational establishments, hotels, sport halls, clubs, rehabilitation centres and studios (classes S and I) where access and control are specifically regulated by the owner (person who has the legal responsibility), equipment for domestic use (class H) and other types of equipment including motor driven equipment as defined in 3.1.
    The specific requirements of another part of ISO 20957 take priority over the corresponding requirements of ISO 20957-1:2005.
    ISO 20957-1:2005 does not apply to stationary training equipment intended for use by children.
