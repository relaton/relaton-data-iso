abstract:
- content: "ISO TR 8550-1:2007 gives general guidance on the selection of an acceptance
    sampling system, scheme or plan. It does this principally in the context of standards
    that either already exist or are presently under development. \nThe guidance is
    confined to acceptance sampling of products that are supplied in lots and that
    can be classified as consisting of discrete items (i.e. discrete articles of product).
    It is assumed that each item in a lot can be identified and segregated from the
    other items in the lot and has an equal chance of being included in the sample.
    Each item of product is countable and has specific characteristics that are measurable
    or classifiable as being conforming or nonconforming (to a given product specification).\nStandards
    on acceptance sampling are typically generic, as a result of which they can be
    applied to a wide variety of inspection situations. These include, but are not
    limited to, the following: end items, such as complete products or sub-assemblies;
    components and raw materials; services; materials in process; supplies in storage;
    maintenance operations; data or records; and administrative procedures.\nAlthough
    ISO TR 8550-1:2007 is written principally in terms of manufacture and production,
    this should be interpreted liberally, as it is applicable to the selection of
    sampling systems, schemes and plans for all types of products and processes as
    defined in ISO 9000."
