  content: "ISO/IEC 17998:2012 describes a framework that provides context and definitions
    to enable organizations to understand and deploy service-oriented architecture
    (SOA) governance. \nISO/IEC 17998:2012 defines: \n- SOA Governance, including
    its relationship between Business, IT, and EA governance; this assists organizations
    in understanding the impact that the introduction of SOA into an organization
    has on governance; \n- an SOA Governance Reference Model (SGRM) and its constituent
    parts, which assists organizations in specifying their appropriate governance
    regimes; and capturing best practice as a basis for a common approach; \n- the
    SOA Governance Vitality Method (SGVM) which assists organizations in customizing
    the SGRM and realizing their SOA Governance Regimen.\nISO/IEC 17998:2012 is not
    intended to be used as provided; it is intended to be customized to create appropriate
    SOA governance for the organization. Many of the lists are non-normative and exemplary
    and intended to be filtered and as input to the customization process. \nISO/IEC
    17998:2012 does not include an explanation of the fundamentals and value of SOA,
    which is important for being able to understand and apply SOA governance. It lists
    some of the many other specifications and books that are available on SOA basics. "
