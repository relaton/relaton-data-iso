abstract:
- content: |-
    This document specifies how to design and operate allocation systems for gas production facilities.
    It describes the most common types, principles and methods used for the allocation of gas and associated liquids. The objective is to provide an approach to current best practice in the oil and gas industry.
    It applies to gas and liquid allocations to be performed in production, processing, transportation, storage and terminal installations dealing with natural gas and associated liquids as well as end products like sales gas, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), liquefied natural gas (LNG), condensate and to some extend non-hydrocarbon gases like CO2, H2.
    This document provides the minimum information needed to develop and implement allocation procedures and systems both for internal purposes (well allocation) and fiscal or commercial applications with different owners and stakeholders.
    This document can be used to develop gas and liquid processing and transportation agreements and regulatory documents as well as to conduct audit of measurement and allocation systems.
    It also introduces the areas of competence needed and the terminology used in the industry.
