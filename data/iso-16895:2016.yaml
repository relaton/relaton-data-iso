    ISO 16895:2016 specifies a classification matrix, related mandatory tests and thickness ranges for ultra-low-, low-, medium- and high-density dry process wood-based fibreboard. It then provides the manufacturing property requirements for these types of uncoated fibreboard.
    The values listed in this International Standard relate to product properties used to classify fibreboards into one of four types (UDF, LDF, MDF and HDF, see Clause 3), one of four grades (GP, FN, BL and LB), for use in one of four service conditions (REG, MR1, MR2, and HMR). The values are not characteristic values to be used for design purposes.
    NOTE          Fibreboards are broadly divided into two groups based on the manufacturing process, namely the dry process group and the wet process group (see Clause 3). Wet process fibreboards lie outside the scope of this International Standard.
