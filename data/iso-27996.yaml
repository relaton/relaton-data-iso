    ISO 27996:2009 is applicable to the general requirements for data recording procedures, packaging, and storing of elastomeric seals and seal assemblies which include an elastomeric element prior to the seal being assembled into hardware components.
    The requirements for packaging are an integral part of the controlled storage procedure and provide a means of positive product identity from the time of manufacture to the time of assembly into a component.
    ISO 27996:2009 does not establish limitations or storage times for assembled components nor the operating life of these components.
    The information contained in ISO 27996:2009 is intended for use by those organizations that do not have specific requirements or recommendations already in place for the control of elastomeric seals and seal assemblies.
    ISO 27996:2009 can be specified in control, storage and procurement documents. However, when the requirements of ISO 27996:2009 are in conflict with the customer's requirements or specifications, the requirements of the customer's detailed specifications take precedence.
