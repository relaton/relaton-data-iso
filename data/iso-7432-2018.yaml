    This document specifies methods of test for joints with a locked socket and spigot, including double-socket joints, and with elastomeric seals, for buried and above ground glass-reinforced thermosetting plastics (GRP) piping systems. It covers methods of test for leaktightness and resistance to damage of the joint only, when subjected to specified combinations of angular movement, compression (deformation) perpendicular to the pipe axis and internal pressure. It assumes that the joint will be exposed to the effects of hydrostatic end thrust.
    This document is applicable to joints for either pressure or non-pressure applications. The tests are suitable for the evaluation of joints intended for applications in which the liquids are conveyed at temperatures specified in the referring standards.
    The joints tested in accordance with this document are subjected to conditions which measure their ability to function and thereby prove the design of the joint, especially for type test purposes. The joint is only qualified according to the test sequences and configurations detailed in this document.
    With the exception of the bending test (see 9.5), the test procedures are applicable to joints for pipes and fittings of all nominal sizes. If not otherwise agreed between the manufacturer and the customer, the bending test detailed in 9.5 is applicable to joints with pipes and fittings up to and including DN 600.
    The test procedures in this document are damaging to the test piece, which will not be suitable for reuse after these tests. The test procedure is intended to be applied for type testing purposes.
    This document is applicable only to the joint and specifies methods of test to prove its design.
