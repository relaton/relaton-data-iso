    This document provides a design process for daylight openings in order to ensure the principle of sustainability in the indoor visual environment. The design process for daylight openings includes the consideration of:
    —          sunshine duration in the building interiors;
    —          daylight opening ratio to the wall area of a habitable room;
    —          daylight opening ratio to the floor area of a habitable room;
    —          appropriate levels of indoor daylight based on human visual needs and the extent of sunlight;
    —          daylight control systems in the building;
    —          thermal comfort, thermal gains and energy efficiency.
    This document is applicable to building environment design for new buildings and the retrofit of existing buildings.
