abstract:
- content: "ISO 16840-3:2006 specifies test methods for the determination of static,
    impact and repetitive load strengths as well as disclosure requirements for postural
    support devices (PSD) with associated attachment hardware intended for use with
    wheelchairs. \nISO 16840-3:2006 does not test the transportability and the use
    of the PSD in a motor vehicle. \nNOTE At the present time there are no minimum
    or maximum strength requirements specified in the test procedures for testing
    for PSDs. In the future, minimum or maximum loads for testing might be specified
    for testing on a pass/fail basis. The maximum displacement, the maximum force
    achieved before failure and the type of failure that occurs is disclosed for comparison
    purposes."
