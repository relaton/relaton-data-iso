abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 15444-5:2015 defines a set of lossless and lossy compression methods
    for coding continuous-tone, bi-level, greyscale or colour digital still images.
    This Recommendation | International Standard provides three independently created
    software reference implementations of Rec. ITU-T T.800 | ISO/IEC 15444-1, in order
    to assist implementers of Rec. ITU-T T.800 | ISO/IEC 15444-1 in testing and understanding
    its content. The packages are JASPER, JJ2000 and OPENJPEG.\nThe reference software
    packages are informative only. This Recommendation | International Standard does
    not define any additional part of the JPEG 2000 image coding system.\nEach version
    of the reference software contains source code, which may be compiled to provide
    the following functionality: \n- transcoding from selected, widely available image
    formats into a JPEG 2000 codestream; \n- transcoding from selected, widely available
    image formats into the JP2 file format; \n- selection of a wide range of JPEG
    2000 encoding options (as documented in each reference software); \n- decoding
    from a JPEG 2000 codestream to a range of selected widely available image formats;
    \n- Processing of a JP2 file to extract a JPEG 2000 codestream for decoding and
    conversion to a range of selected widely available image formats. \n- The ability
    to extract metadata from a JP2 file, including the contents of the Image Header
    box and the colour space. \n- The decoding of JP2 files that use the Three-Component
    Matrix-Based form of the Restricted ICC method for the specification of colour
    space and the conversion of the decoded image data to the sRGB colour space for
    display, including limited upsampling of all decoded components to the same resolution.
    \n- The decoding of JP2 files that use the Monochrome form of the Restricted ICC
    method for the specification of colour space and the conversion of the decoded
    image data to the sRGB based greyscale space as defined within the JP2 file format.
    \n- The decoding of JP2 files that use the sYCC colour space and the conversion
    of the decoded image data to the sRGB colour space for display, including upsampling
    of all decoded components to the same resolution. \n- some additional tools to
    help with evaluation and testing.\nThe reference software is intended for use
    as a testing and validation tool for other implementations of JPEG 2000, and to
    help in the understanding of Rec. ITU-T T.800 | ISO/IEC 15444-1. Although components
    of the reference software may find application in software intended for product
    development, this was not an objective of the development of this software, and
    prospective implementers are cautioned against making any estimations of performance
    or resource usage based on the reference software."
