abstract:
- content: This Technical Specification advises users on how to decide if laser diffraction
    is the most appropriate method for analysis of their samples, to prepare samples
    appropriately, to verify proper functioning of their instrument, to interpret
    their data, and to assess data quality. This Technical Specification focuses on
    the practical steps required to obtain results of good quality, rather than on
    theoretical considerations, and covers not only the measurement of solid particles,
    but also emulsions and bubbles. Result variation expectations of real samples
    will also be considered.
