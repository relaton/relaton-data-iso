  content: Threads are removed from a strip of fabric of known length, straightened
    by a tension which is varied according to the nature and linear density of the
    yarn, and measured in the straightened state. The difference between the straightened
    length of the thread and the distance between the ends while in fabric is expressed
    as a percentage of the latter.
