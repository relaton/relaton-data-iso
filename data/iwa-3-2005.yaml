    IWA 3:2005 establishes the concept of image safety for all categories of image providers as well as for those who view moving images, such as computer/video games, movies, videos and video pictures on websites. It also defines the following undesirable biomedical effects caused by moving images:
    - photosensitive seizures;
    - visually-induced motion sickness;
    - visual fatigue.
    IWA 3:2005 supplies viewers as well as image providers with recommendations as to how to reduce the biomedical risks to which they may be susceptible.
    IWA 3:2005 does not have any contents intended for regulatory use.
