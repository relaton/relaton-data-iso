- content: |-
    ISO 15463:2003 specifies requirements and gives recommendations for field inspection and testing of oil country tubular goods (OCTG). ISO 15463:2003 covers the practices and technology commonly used in field inspection; however, certain practices may also be suitable for mill inspections.
    ISO 15463:2003 covers the qualification of inspection personnel, a description of inspection methods and apparatus calibration and standardization procedures for various inspection methods. The evaluation of imperfections and marking of inspected OCTG are included.
    ISO 15463:2003 is applicable to field inspection of OCTG and is not applicable for use as a basis for acceptance or rejection (for which the applicable purchasing specification is applicable, see 5.4.2)
