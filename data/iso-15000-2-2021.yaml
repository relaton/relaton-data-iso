  content: "This document describes the AS4 Profile, which provides a subset of the
    functionality of ISO 15000‑1:2021, along with implementation guidelines based
    on the \"just-enough\" design principles and electronic data interchange functional
    requirements to trim down ISO 15000-1:2021 into a more simplified specification
    for web services business-to-business messaging.\nIt specifies:\n-       three
    conformance profiles of ISO 15000-1:2021 (see Clause 4);\n-       a number of
    AS4 additional features (see Clause 5);\n-       complementary requirements for
    the AS4 multi-hop profile (see Clause 6);\n-       AS4 usage profile of ISO 15000-1:2021
    (see Clause 7);\n-       definitions of conformance (see Clause 8).\nAnnex A provides
    some sample messages to support implementation.\nAnnex B provides a sample XSLT
    stylesheet to generate an AS4 receipt.\nThis document is applicable to all types
    of organizations (e.g., commercial enterprises, government agencies, not-for-profit
    organizations) that exchange documents or data electronically using messaging. "
