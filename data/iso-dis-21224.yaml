    This document is applicable for steel cast slabs for pipe production manufactured in continuous casting process. These steels have a typical chemical composition as follows (mass percentages):

    C ≤ 0,12 %
    Mn ≤ 2,0 %
    Si ≤ 0,5 %
    Ti + Nb + V ≤ 0,2 %

    The common dimensions of these slabs are in the following ranges:
    Slab width: 800 mm to 2 600 mm
    Slab thickness: 150 mm to 450 mm
