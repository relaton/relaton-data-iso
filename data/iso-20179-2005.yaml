  script: Latn
  content: ISO 20179:2005 specifies a method for the determination and quantification
    of microcystins in raw water (containing biomass) and treated water, such as tap
    water. The method described is validated for MCYST-RR, MCYST-YR, and MCYST-LR.
    It is also applicable for the determination of several structure variants of these
    microcystins, but an unambiguous identification cannot be made due to the lack
    of commercially available standards and due to co-elution.
