abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: ISO 17862:2014 specifies a method for determining the maximum count rate
    for an acceptable limit of divergence from linearity of the intensity scale in
    single ion counting time-of-flight (TOF) secondary ion mass spectrometers using
    a test based on isotopic ratios in spectra from poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE).
    It also includes a method to correct for intensity nonlinearity arising from intensity
    lost from a microchannel plate (MCP) or scintillator and photomultiplier followed
    by a time-to-digital converter (TDC) detection system caused by secondary ions
    arriving during its dead-time. The correction can increase the intensity range
    for 95 % linearity by a factor of up to more than 50 so that a higher maximum
    count rate can be employed for those spectrometers for which the relevant correction
    formulae have been shown to be valid. ISO 17862:2014 can also be used to confirm
    the validity of instruments in which the dead-time correction is already made
    but in which further increases can or cannot be possible.
