    For security evaluation of biometric recognition performance and presentation attack detection for biometric verification systems and biometric identification systemsthis document specifies:
    —     extended security functional components to SFR Classes in ISO/IEC 15408-2;
    —     supplementary activities to methodology specified in ISO/IEC 18045 for SAR Classes of ISO/IEC 15408-3.
    This document introduces the general framework for the security evaluation of biometric systems, including extended security functional components, and supplementary activities to methodology, which is additional evaluation activities and guidance/recommendations for an evaluator to handle those activities. The supplementary evaluation activities are developed in this document while the detailed recommendations are developed in ISO/IEC 19989-2 (for biometric recognition aspects) and in ISO/IEC 19989-3 (for presentation attack detection aspects). This document is applicable only to TOEs for single biometric characteristic type. However, the selection of a characteristic from multiple characteristics in SFRs is allowed.
