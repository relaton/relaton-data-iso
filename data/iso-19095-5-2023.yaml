    This document specifies a method of testing the adhesion in plastic-metal joints produced by several techniques: adhesive bonding, direct joining of thermoplastics by injection or compression moulding, or other methods. More specifically this testing method provides a measure of the joint resistance to fracture in the region between plastic and metal adherends.
    This method can only be used for comparing adhesives, surface treatments, bonding conditions and effects of environmental conditions. The results cannot be used for engineering design purposes.
