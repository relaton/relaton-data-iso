abstract:
- content: |-
    ISO 18440:2016 defines a protocol for transfer of SLE PDUs between an SLE user and an SLE provider system in terms of:
    a)    the procedures used to establish and release associations;
    b)    the messages exchanged on an established association;
    c)    the procedures used to monitor the status of data communication connections; and
    d)    the methods used to ensure that data are converted between different formats and representations on different platforms.
    It does not specify:
    a)    individual designs, implementations, or products;
    b)    the configuration of the data communications infrastructure, including configuration of the TCP and IP protocols;
    c) the means by which addresses (IP addresses and TCP port numbers) are agreed, assigned and communicated.
