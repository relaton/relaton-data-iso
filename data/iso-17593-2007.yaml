abstract:
- content: "ISO 17593:2007 specifies requirements for in vitro measuring systems for
    self-monitoring of vitamin-K antagonist therapy, including performance, quality
    assurance and user training and procedures for the verification and validation
    of performance by the intended users under actual and simulated conditions of
    use. \nISO 17593:2007 pertains solely to prothrombin time measuring systems used
    by individuals for monitoring their own vitamin-K antagonist therapy, and which
    report results as international normalized ratios (INR). \nISO 17593:2007 is applicable
    to manufacturers of such systems and those other organizations (e.g., regulatory
    authorities and conformity assessment bodies) having the responsibility for assessing
    the performance of these systems.\nISO 17593:2007 does not\n- pertain to in vitro
    measuring systems for coagulation quantities assessing vitamin-K antagonist therapy
    used by physicians or healthcare providers, \n- provide a comprehensive evaluation
    of all possible factors that could affect the performance of these systems, or\n-
    address the medical aspects of oral anticoagulation therapy. "
