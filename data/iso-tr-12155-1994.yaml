  content: Specifies requirements and tests for detection devices which indicate to
    the driver of a commercial road vehicle, when he is reversing, the presence of
    objects which are within the monitoring range of the device. Applies to detection
    devices with non-contact sensors which can be fitted on commercial vehicles to
    improve safety during manoeuvring at a speed of up to 5 km/h, but they do not
    relieve the driver of his special responsibility when reversing.
