    ISO 29283:2011 specifies the options appropriate for CALM using mobile wireless broadband (MWB) techniques conforming to the IEEE 802.20 air interface and protocol specification recommended by ITU-R M.1801, and specifies the management interface requirements.
    CALM links are required for quasi-continuous, prolonged and short duration communications between vehicles and the roadside, between vehicles, and between mobile equipment and fixed infrastructure points, over medium and long ranges.
    Wherever practicable, ISO 29283:2011 has been developed by reference to suitable extant standards, adopted by selection. Required regional variations are provided.
    Application specific upper layers are not included in ISO 29283:2011, but will be driven by application standards.
