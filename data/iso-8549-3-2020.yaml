    This document defines terms relating to orthoses.
    This document does not include terms for orthoses that only encompass limb segments, as these orthoses are limited mainly to use in the treatment of fractures and in sports medicine.
    NOTE 1  The types of components used in the construction of orthoses are classified and described in ISO 13404.
    NOTE 2  For the purposes of this document the abbreviated term ?orthotics' and its derivatives only apply to external orthotics.
