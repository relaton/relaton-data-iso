    ISO 24638:2008 establishes the baseline requirements for the design, fabrication and testing of space flight pressure components. It also establishes the requirements for assembly, installation, test, inspection, operation and maintenance of the pressure systems in spacecraft and launch vehicles. These requirements, when implemented on a particular space system, ensure a high level of confidence in achieving safe and reliable operation.
    ISO 24638:2008 applies to all pressure components other than pressure vessels and pressurized structures in a pressure system. It covers lines, fittings, valves, bellows, hoses and other appropriate components that are integrated to form a pressure system.
