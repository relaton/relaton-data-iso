  content: "ISO 18828-4:2018 specifies a set of key performance indicators in production
    planning, which allow comparison and monitoring of the production planning process
    in a standardized framework. \nAs a first step, the utilization of the KPIs is
    elaborated in order to organize the indicators in a multi-level system taking
    different ranges of the planning process into account. This development of a multi-level
    system represents the core of ISO 18828-4:2018. The scope of the planning processes
    discussed in ISO 18828-4:2018 is limited to production planning for products in
    series production. Only tasks carried out within the production planning process
    are considered in this approach. \nAll key indicators presented are recommendations
    and can also be used in accordance with the general validity of the reference
    process from ISO 18828‑2 and relate to the content described in ISO 18828-4:2018."
