abstract:
- content: |-
    ISO 8686-1:2012 establishes general methods for the calculating loads and principles to be used in the selection of load combinations for proofs of competence in accordance with ISO 20332 for the structural and mechanical components of cranes as defined in ISO 4306-1.
    It is based on rigid-body kinetic analysis and elastostatic analysis but expressly permits the use of more advanced methods (calculations or tests) to evaluate the effects of loads and load combinations, and the values of dynamic load factors, where it can be demonstrated that these provide at least equivalent levels of competence.
    ISO 8686-1:2012 provides for two distinct kinds of application: the general form, content and ranges of parameter values for more specific standards to be developed for individual crane types; a framework for agreement on loads and load combinations between a designer or manufacturer and a crane purchaser for those types of cranes where specific standards do not exist.
