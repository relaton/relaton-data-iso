abstract:
- content: Applies to tanks above 8 m in diameter with cylindrical courses that are
    substantially vertical. Provides a method for determining the volumetric quantity
    contained within a tank at gauged liquid levels by optical triangulation using
    theodolites and laser beams. The measurement required to determine the radius
    may be made internally or externally. The external method is applicable only to
    tanks that are free of insulation. For tilted tanks with a deviation of up to
    3 % from the vertical a correction as described in ISO 7507-1 may be applied.
