  content: This international standard intends to establish a guideline for the ground-based
    environmental tests of thermal control materials (TCMs) used on spacecraft’s surface.
    This standard describes the test methods of charged particle radiation(s), solar
    ultraviolet (UV), atomic oxygen (AO) and thermal cycling. Typical TCMs include,
    but are not limited to, coatings, optical solar reflector (OSR) and metallized
    plastic films. Other materials, for which similar requirements apply, can refer
    to this standard. This international standard is devoted to material estimation/evaluation
    tests and can be tailored according to specific applications.
