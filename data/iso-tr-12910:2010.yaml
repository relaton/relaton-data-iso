  content: "ISO/TR 12910:2010 provides an introduction and synopsis of comparisons
    among the following four national design documents on light-frame timber (wood)
    construction: \n- AS 1684-1, AS 1684-2 and AS 1684-3;\n- the Engineering guide
    for wood-frame construction; \n- NZS 3604; \n- the Wood Frame Construction Manual
    (WFCM) for One- and Two-Family Dwellings (Chapter 1: General information, Chapter
    2: Engineered design and Chapter 3: Prescriptive design).\nEach of the four light-frame
    texts compared in ISO/TR 12910:2010 is based on a national timber design standard
    that includes provisions for assemblies and systems, which go beyond single-member
    design methodology."
