  content: Applies to coal pick shanks, chisel shanks, rivet snap shanks (parallel
    or tapered), breaker and spade shanks, concrete breaker shanks and rock drill
    shanks. These types relate to the machine for which they are mainly designed,
    but this does not prevent the use of the shanks for other applications. ISO 1180
    does not apply to pneumatic hammer and their chuck bushings but those features
    of chuck bushings (dimensions and tolerances) which ensure interchangeability
    are specified.
