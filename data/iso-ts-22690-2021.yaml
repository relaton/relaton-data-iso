    This document specifies reliability assessment criteria for high-throughput gene-expression data.
    It is applicable to assessing the accuracy, reproducibility, and comparability of gene-expression data that are generated from microarray, next-generation sequencing, and other forms of high-throughput technologies.
    This document identifies the quality-related data for the process of the next-generation sequencing of RNA (RNA-seq). The sequencing platform covered by this document is limited to short-read sequencers. The use of RNA-seq for mutation detection and virus identification is outside of the scope of this document.
    This document is applicable to human health associated species such as human, cell lines, and preclinical animals. Other biological species are outside the scope of this document.
    From a biological point of view, expression profiles of all genetic sequences including genes, transcripts, isoforms, exons, and junctions are within the scope of this document
