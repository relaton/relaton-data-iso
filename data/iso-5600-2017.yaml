    ISO 5600:2017 specifies a method for the determination of the static vulcanized adhesion strength of rubber compounds to rigid materials. The test piece is composed of two conical ends of the rigid material, joined by a cylinder of rubber.
    The adhesion is obtained by a bonding system which can include not only the rigid material and the rubber compound, but other elements such as thin alloy coatings or chemical treatments of rigid parts and either a single cement or both primer and cover cements. The bonding system for preparing the test pieces should be adequately specified by the user, but provision is made in this document for the evaluation of different types of failure related to a complex bonding system.
    The method is designed primarily for test pieces prepared in the laboratory under standard conditions in order to provide data for development and control of bonding systems and their components, such as cements or special rubber compounds, and of methods of manufacture. While intended to be applied where the rubber is bonded to rigid supporting pieces, it might not cover such cases where the support, although of high-modulus material, has a low rigidity due to small transverse dimensions, as in the case of rubber bonded to metal wires, cords or thin sheets.
