abstract:
- content: Establishes the requirements for the overall dimensions of blade-type electric
    fuse-links with rated currents up to and including 30 A, used to protect on-board
    wiring harnesses and electrical equipment, with a rated voltage up to and including
    32 V, of road vehicles and similar applications from overcurrent. Interruption
    of the circuit is achieved as a result of the fuse element melting. Rated current,
    identification, test procedures and performance of blade-type electric fuse-links
    are specified in ISO 8820-1, and the test fixture in ISO 8820-3.
