    This document defines two performance levels for welded joints, namely Basic Demand and Critical Demand, for longitudinal tensile strength of weld metals, impact toughness of weld metals, and heat affected zones (HAZ) to suit the level of seismic performance required of welded steel structures.
    This document supplements provisions of applicable standards or codes for the execution of steelwork, welding procedure qualification tests performed when new steel materials or welding consumables are applied or on a welding procedure applied at complicated welded joints, and applies to destructive tests conducted for qualification when the welding parameters have been changed.
