    ISO 14055-1:2017 defines a framework for identifying good practices in land management, based on assessment of the drivers of land degradation and risks associated with current and past practices. Guidance on monitoring and reporting implementation of good practices is also provided.
    ISO 14055-1:2017 is intended for use by private and public sector organizations with responsibility for land management and will allow an organization to communicate implementation of good practices.
