  content: "ISO/IEC 15504 provides a framework for the assessment of processes. This
    framework can be used by organizations involved in planning, managing, monitoring,
    controlling, and improving the acquisition, supply, development, operation, evolution
    and support of products and services.\nISO/IEC 15504-4:2004 provides guidance
    on how to utilize a conformant process assessment within a process improvement
    programme or for process capability determination. \nWithin a process improvement
    (PI) context, process assessment provides a means of characterizing an organizational
    unit in terms of the capability of selected processes. Analysis of the output
    of a conformant process assessment against an organizational unit's business goals
    identifies strengths, weaknesses and risks related to the processes. This, in
    turn, can help determine whether the processes are effective in achieving business
    goals, and provide the drivers for making improvements.\nProcess capability determination
    (PCD) is concerned with analysing the output of one or more conformant process
    assessments to identify the strengths, weaknesses and risks involved in undertaking
    a specific project using the selected processes within a given organizational
    unit. A process capability determination can provide a fundamental input to supplier
    selection, in which case it is often termed a \"supplier capability determination\".\nISO/IEC
    15504-4:2004 describes the PI and PCD processes and how to deploy them, and provides
    guidance on\n- utilizing process assessment,\n- selecting Process Reference Model(s),\n-
    setting target capability,\n- defining the assessment input,\n- inferring process-related
    risk from assessment output,\n- steps of process improvement,\n- steps of process
    capability determination,\n- comparability of assessment output analysis."
