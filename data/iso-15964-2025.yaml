abstract:
- content: This document specifies safety and quality requirements for detection and
    avoidance (DAA) systems used between uncrewed aircraft systems (UAS) and other
    objects including aircraft. This document includes the requirements for radars
    and optical sensors used for DAA and is derived to meet the requirements for UAS
    operations involving DAA set out in ISO 21384-3.
