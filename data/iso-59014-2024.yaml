abstract:
- content: |-
    This document provides principles, requirements and guidance for organizations in fostering the sustainability and traceability of activities and processes for the recovery of secondary materials.
    This document also specifies requirements and provides guidance for organizations that engage with individuals involved in subsistence activities (SAs) as part of the organization’s activities and processes for the recovery of secondary materials, with the aim of ensuring safe and healthy working conditions and the continual improvement of the well-being, livelihoods and professional practices of those individuals.
    This document is applicable to organizations seeking to recover secondary materials systematically and responsibly using life cycle and circular economy perspectives, regardless of their size, type and location.
    This document does not provide quality criteria for specific types of secondary materials recovered. Energy recovery and disposal are outside the scope of this document.
    The collection, classification, sorting and non-destructive processes can lead to the recovery of components and products. The preparation and processing of products or components for their reuse or reprocessing (e.g. for repurposing, remanufacturing, refurbishment and repair) are outside the scope of this document.
