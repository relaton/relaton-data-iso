    ISO/TR 20172:2006 provides a European grouping system for materials for welding purposes, classified in accordance with the grouping system of ISO/TR 15608.
    It may also apply for other purposes as heat treatment, forming, non destructive testing. Types of steels in accordance with the grouping system of ISO/TR 15608:2005, Table 1.
    This Technical Report covers grouping systems for the following standardized materials:
    - steel;
    - aluminium and its alloys;
    - nickel and its alloys;
    - copper and its alloys;
    - titanium and its alloys;
    - zirconium and its alloys;
    - cast iron.
