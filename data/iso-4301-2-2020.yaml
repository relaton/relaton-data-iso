    This document establishes a general classification of mobile cranes and related crane mechanisms based on the service conditions, mainly expressed by the following:
    —     the total number of working cycles to be carried out during the specified design life of the crane;
    —     the load spectrum factor which represents the relative frequencies of loads to be handled;
    —     the average load displacements.
    This document is applicable for the work spectrum between moderate to very heavy number of work cycles as described in Table 2.
