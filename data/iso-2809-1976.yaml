    parties. The posible forms which the test requirement may take are the following:
    The test material shall be at least as ligthfast as a specified wool scale pattern
    exposed simultaneously or an agreed paint sample exposed simultaneously. It should
    show no greater change within a specified period than a previously exposed reference
    sample. Exposure to light from artificial sources under prescribed conditions.'
