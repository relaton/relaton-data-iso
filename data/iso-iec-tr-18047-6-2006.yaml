abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 18000 defines the air interfaces for radio frequency identification
    (RFID) devices used in item management applications. ISO/IEC 18000-6 defines the
    air interface for these devices operating at frequencies from 860 MHz to 960 MHz.\nThe
    purpose of ISO/IEC TR 18047 is to provide test methods for conformance with the
    various parts of ISO/IEC 18000.\nEach part of ISO/IEC TR 18047 contains all measurements
    required to be made on a product in order to establish whether it conforms to
    the corresponding part of ISO/IEC 18000. For ISO/IEC TR 18047-6:2006, each interrogator
    needs to be assessed for operation with both types A and B, while each tag is
    only required to support at least one of the types A or B.\nIt should be noted
    that measurement of tag and interrogator performance is covered by ISO/IEC TR
    18046.\nISO/IEC TR 18047-6:2006 defines test methods for determining the conformance
    of radio frequency identification devices (tags and interrogators) for item management
    with the specifications given in ISO/IEC 18000-6, but does not apply to the testing
    of conformity with regulatory or similar requirements.\nThe test methods require
    only that the mandatory functions, and any optional functions which are implemented,
    be verified. This may, in appropriate circumstances, be supplemented by further,
    application-specific functionality criteria that are not available in the general
    case.\nThe interrogator and tag conformance parameters in ISO/IEC TR 18047-6:2006
    are the following:\n- type-specific conformance parameters including nominal values
    and tolerances;\n- parameters that apply directly affecting system functionality
    and inter-operability.\nThe following are not included in ISO/IEC TR 18047-6:2006:\n-
    parameters that are already included in regulatory test requirements;\n- high-level
    data encoding conformance test parameters (these are specified in ISO/IEC 15962).
    \nUnless otherwise specified, the tests in ISO/IEC TR 18047-6:2006 are to be applied
    exclusively to RFID tags and interrogators defined in ISO/IEC 18000-6.\nISO/IEC
    TR 18047-6:2006 also describes all necessary conformance tests."
