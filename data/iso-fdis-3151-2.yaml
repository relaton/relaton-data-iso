    Scope of the proposed deliverable

    This part of the standard specifies a data model of visualization elements for 3D data exchange for error information feedback between Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) and Manufacturing Execution System (MES or MOM: Manufacturing Operations Management) in the plant industry.

    The following are within the scope of this standard.
    a) Data model of visualization elements for the plant industry with complex and long-lifespan products.
    b) Defining the properties of the data model for the visualization elements of the PLM-MES interface.
    c) Relationship with the information model of visualization elements as defined in ISO 10303-239 Product Lifecycle Support
    d) Relationship with the information model of the visualization element as defined in IEC 62264 Enterprise Control System Integration

    The following are out of the scope of this standard.
    a) Information model of visualization elements for the industry of products with simple and short-lifespan products.
    b) The definition of the method of the data model representing the visualization elements of the PLM-MES interface.
    c) Overall coverage of the PLM-MES interface. A larger outline is covered in ISO TR 3151-1.
