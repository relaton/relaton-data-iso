    This document specifies grading procedures for visually and mechanically sorting round, or pole, bamboo for structural applications using such fundamental elements. Visual sorting is based on observable characteristics of the piece(s). Mechanical sorting is based on non-destructive measurement of properties known to correlate to characteristic values defining a grade.
    The grading procedures in this document can be used in a quality acceptance regime, although this document does not define or address acceptance criteria.
    This document is applicable only for bamboo that is graded in the seasoned state.
