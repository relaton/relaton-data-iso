  content: Lays down dimensions, tolerances, measuring loads and minimum breaking
    loads, together with the tooth gap forms and rim profiles of the associated chain
    wheels for these chains suitable for the conveying of bulk materials and related
    applications. The chain is designed to operate with the closed end of each link
    forward for maximum scraping action against the material to be conveyed. Five
    types of attachments are given. The chain dimensions ensure complete interchangeability
    of individual links of chain.
