abstract:
- content: "This document specifies the minimum functionalities of a digital safe
    in order to ensure the integrity, confidentiality and availability of the documents
    archived therein.\n\nThis document is intended to define the main features of
    digital safe software:\n-\tManagement of integrity: Software must ensures that
    the documents associated metadata are correct and have not even in any manner
    been improperly changed.\n-\tManagement of confidentiality: Digital safe must
    provide the protection of users ‘data. It must ensure that users can know, decide
    and control the use of their personal data stored in a Digital Safe.\n-\tTraceability
    of actions: The use of a digital safe must make possible to identify when and
    by whom a document was filed. This type of software must provide traceability
    of all actions performed on the archive: additions, deletions, reading, etc. \n-\tDocument
    protection: A digital safe is an software designed to protect any type of file.
    It allows the user to have a security mechanism on each document or on a specific
    folder, according to his needs. Digital safe software must be able to use encryption
    algorithms to secure data.\n-\tRetrieving documents: A digital safe software must
    capable to retrieve all documents that are supposed to be integrated into it.\n-\tExport
    documents and interoperability: The ability to transfer documents and their metadata
    from one digital safe to another digital safe.\n\nIn practical terms, a digital
    safe can store documents of all kinds: invoices, contracts, diplomas, identity
    documents, etc.\n\nThis document is intended for:\n-\tDesigners or integrators
    of a solution or implementation.\n-\tService providers.\n-\tPublishers or manufacturers
    of hardware and/or software providing a solution or implementation.\n-\tConsultants
    and auditors.\n\nThis document does not address system environments that may be
    necessary for the operation of Digital safe, such as physical security (fire extinguishing
    system, armoured doors, presence detectors, etc.), power supply security (generators
    and inverters) or telecommunication lines.\nNor does the present document address
    the operating procedures for Digital Safe. These are the responsibility of the
    Digital Safe operator."
