  content: "ISO/IEC 24751-2:2008 provides a common information model for describing
    the learner or user needs and preferences when accessing digitally delivered resources
    or services. This description is one side of a pair of descriptions used in matching
    user needs and preferences with education delivery (as described in ISO/IEC 24751-1).\nISO/IEC
    24751-2:2008 discusses the basic principles adhered to in developing this model
    for describing personal needs and preferences. It explains: the rationale for
    using a functional approach to describing needs, possible methods of creating
    a personal needs and preference statement, the major groupings of needs and preferences
    within the standard, the use of different needs and preferences statements in
    different contexts, how needs and preferences can be ranked with respect to priority,
    and the use of generic and application-specific needs and preference specifications.
    \nIt contains the information model for ISO/IEC 24751-2:2008, including the attribute,
    allowed occurrence and datatype of each element. It defines and describes how
    the terms in the information model should be used. \nConformance to ISO/IEC 24751-2:2008
    is discussed. Conformance is dependent on the role played by the conformant technology.
    Conformance requirements for both education delivery applications and alternative
    access systems are explained. \nISO/IEC 24751-2:2008 provides \n- a consolidated
    list of all the terms defined in ISO/IEC 24751-2:2008, sorted in French alphabetical
    order, \n- the ISO French language equivalent terms and definitions, and\n- the
    codes representing the gender of the French terms. \nThe vocabulary codes, values
    and associated rules of application are defined. An informative list of recommended
    default values for the learner preferences and needs is provided.\nIt lists existing
    bindings of the IMS Learner Information Package Accessibility for LIP - Version
    1 [ACCLIP] that serves as the reference specification for ISO/IEC 24751-2:2008.\nIt
    describes information scenarios for applying ISO/IEC 24751-2:2008 and gives informative
    implementation examples. \nUse of ISO/IEC 24751-2:2008 will assist in matching
    individual learner needs in a computer mediated learning environment with the
    necessary user interface and resources needed to meet those needs. "
