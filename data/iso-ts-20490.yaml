  content: This technical specification is focused on measuring the Auto-Focus (AF)
    repeatability of sharpness and latency, meaning camera system’s capability to
    produce sharp images in certain time frame. Scope of this technical specification
    is limited to test autofocus sharpness and latency repeatability with stationary
    targets only as testing with moving targets is not covered.
