  content: The principle consists in the evaporation to dryness of a test portion
    and dissolution of the residue in hydrochloric acid. Reduction of iron(III) by
    means of hydroxylammonium chloride. Formation of the iron(II)- 2,2'-dipyridyl
    complex. Photometric measurement of the coloured complex at a wavelength of about
    522 nm. Specifies the use of a spectrophotometer or photoelectric absorptionmeter.
    As an alternative it is permitted to employ a visual method comparing the test
    solution with a series of reference solutions. Has also been approved by the IUPAC.
