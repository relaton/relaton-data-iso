- content: |-
    This document describes a laboratory test method, using an IGT1-type or a prüfbau2-type printability tester, for the preparation of specimens to evaluate the absorption rate of an ink on a substrate in offset lithography by setting-off the printed surface to an unprinted surface.
    This method describes testing with an amount of ink simulating either single colour or multi-colour printing. The print and the set-off print (counter print) are made with interval times, between print and set-off, common for the target process.
    This method evaluates a particular ink and substrate combination.
