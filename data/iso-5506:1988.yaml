  content: The method allows inadequate cookingof the products to be detected. It
    applies to products having a urease activity of less than 1 mg of nitrogen per
    gram of product as received. For more active products the mass of test may be
    reduced. The principle consists in mixing of a ground test portion with a buffered
    urea solution, after keeping the mixture for 30 min at 30 C, neutralization of
    the ammonia liberated, with an exess of hydrochloric acid solution, and back-titration
    with standard volumetric hydroxide solution.
