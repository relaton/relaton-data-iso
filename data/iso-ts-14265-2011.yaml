  content: "ISO/TS 14265:2011 defines a set of high-level categories of purposes for
    which personal health information can be processed. This is in order to provide
    a framework for classifying the various specific purposes that can be defined
    and used by individual policy domains (e.g. healthcare organizations, regional
    health authorities, jurisdictions, countries) as an aid to the consistent management
    of information in the delivery of health care services and for the communication
    of electronic health records across organizational and jurisdictional boundaries.
    \ \nThe scope of application of ISO/TS 14265:2011 is limited to Personal Health
    Information as defined in ISO 27799, information about an identifiable person
    that relates to the physical or mental health of the individual, or to provision
    of health services to the individual. "
