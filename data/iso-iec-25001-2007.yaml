  content: "ISO/IEC 25001:2007 provides details about the planning and management
    requirements associated with software product quality requirements and evaluation.\nWhile
    it is mainly concerned with product quality requirements and evaluation, wherever
    it is relevant the corresponding process requirements and evaluation activities
    are also discussed.\nISO/IEC 25001:2007 aims to clarify the requirements which
    should be identified by the organization in order to ensure the success of specifying
    quality requirements and executing the evaluation. \nISO/IEC 25001:2007 is intended
    to be used in conjunction with the other parts of the SQuaRE series (ISO/IEC 25000-ISO/IEC
    25051) of International Standards, and with ISO/IEC 14598 and ISO/IEC 9126-1 until
    superseded by the ISO/IEC 25000 series of International Standards.\nISO/IEC 25001:2007
    complies with the technical processes identified in ISO/IEC 15288 related to quality
    requirements definition and analysis. "
