abstract:
- content: The rating conditions are given in publications produced by various organizations
    such as CECOMAF for different practical uses. Because of many varying conditions
    in the presentation of performance data, it is not possible to make a direct comparison.
    Specified are therfore the items of performance data relating to the refrigerating
    capacity and power absorbed so that such comparisons may be made.
