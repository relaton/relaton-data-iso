    ISO/TS 29284:2012 specifies:
    1) reference architecture for event-based probe vehicles which encompasses event-based probe data and standard probe data elements (ISO 22837:2009);
    2) basic data framework of event-based probe data reporting, based on ISO 22837:2009;
    3) the definition of an initial set of event-based probe data elements. These elements will be commonly used in typical event-based probe data enabled application domains, such as traffic, weather, and safety. Standardizing these event-based probe data elements facilitates the development of probe vehicle systems and the distribution of probe data. This is not intended to be an exhaustive listing of event-based probe data probe data elements.
    ISO/TS 29284:2012 provides a common framework for defining event-based probe data messages to facilitate the specification and design of probe vehicle systems.
    It provides concrete definitions of event-based probe data elements.
    It serves as a supplement to ISO 22837:2009, and specifies additional normative data (probe data elements) that are delivered by an event-based probe data system.
