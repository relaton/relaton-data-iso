- content: |-
    Variable message signs (VMSs) are installed in areas where traffic managers identify a frequent need to convey information to the travelling public, such as upstream from interchanges to alert the public to downstream congestion in time for them to alter their routes. This allows traffic managers to improve the efficiency, safety and quality of traveller journeys.
    In order to manage the operation of a VMS and the messages displayed, information exchange between the management systems and the VMS is needed.
    This document identifies basic user needs for the management of light-emitting diode (LED) matrix VMSs and traces these needs to interoperable designs. This includes the ability to identify the device, its capabilities, and its status.
