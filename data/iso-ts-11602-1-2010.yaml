    ISO/TS 11602-1:2010 gives requirements for the selection and installation of portable and wheeled fire extinguishers. It is intended as a companion to ISO/TS 11602-2.
    It is not applicable to permanently installed systems for fire extinguishment, even though portions of such systems may be portable (such as hose and nozzles attached to a fixed supply of extinguishing media).
    Its requirements are minimum requirements. The use of larger, higher-rated or greater numbers of extinguishers will, in general, improve protection.
    Extinguishers for use on board aircraft, watercraft and vehicles are outside its scope.
