    Field devices are a key component in intelligent transport systems (ITS). Field devices include traffic signals, message signs, weather stations, traffic sensors, roadside equipment for connected ITS (C-ITS) environments, etc.
    Field devices often need to exchange information with other external entities. Field devices can be quite complex, necessitating the standardization of many data concepts for exchange. As such, the ISO 22741 series is divided into several individual Parts. This document (Part 1) introduces the ISO 22741 series and provides normative content that applies to the rest of the series.
