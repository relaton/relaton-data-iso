abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 29168-1:2011 specifies the object identifier (OID) resolution
    system (ORS), including the overall architecture and a DNS-based resolution mechanism.\nIt
    specifies the means for inserting any application-defined information associated
    with an OID node into the domain name system (DNS) and the means of retrieval
    of that information using the ORS.\nIt does not restrict the number of applications
    it can support.\nIt specifies the required operation of an ORS client, including
    the mapping of an OID-IRI (internationalized resource identifier) value by the
    ORS client into a DNS name to produce a DNS query for the specified application
    information and the processing of any returned information. The ORS has no role
    in the allocation or registration of OID nodes.\nThe required behaviour of an
    ORS client is specified, but the interfaces to it are specified only in terms
    of the semantics of the interaction. A bit-level application program interface
    is platform- and software-dependent, and is not in the scope of ISO/IEC 29168-1:2011.
    \nIt does not include a tutorial or complete specification on the management of
    DNS zone files; it specifies (only) the DNS resource records that need to be inserted
    in the zone files in order to support ORS access to the information associated
    with an OID node.\nISO/IEC 29168-1:2011 specifies required DNS zone file resource
    records, and prohibits the use of other resource records of a similar form but
    with different semantics (in DNS zone files in the .oid res.org domain). It does
    not otherwise restrict the general use of DNS zone files."
