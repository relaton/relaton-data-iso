abstract:
- content: This new proposal defines terms and definitions used in the field of seawater
    desalination. It includes more than 90 definitions for the integral seawater desalination
    process covering basic definitions, water intake, pretreatment, membrane desalination,
    thermal desalination, post-treatment and auxiliary system. It is applicable to
    all types and sizes of seawater desalination facilities and systems to all types
    of stakeholders involved in seawater desalination. Its purpose is to foster mutual
    understanding among different stakeholders in the corresponding field.
