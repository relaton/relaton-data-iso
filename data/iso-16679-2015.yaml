    ISO 16679:2015 provides relative motion analysis elements after LV/SC separation, including analysis input, analysis principle, analysis method and analysis output. It is applicable to the mission design and verification for the prediction of relative motion after LV/SC separation.
    This International Standard focuses on the relative motion between the objects involved in one launch mission. It does not cover the issues about the collision avoidance between newly launched objects and on-orbit ones.
