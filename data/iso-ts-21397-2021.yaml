  content: This document specifies a method for determining the kinetics and yields
    of gaseous emissions from a specimen exposed to radiant heat in a cone calorimeter.
    Gas yields are determined by exposing small representative specimens to an external
    heat flux with or without spark ignition. The concentrations of specific gases
    in the effluent (smoke) are measured. In combination with calculated masses of
    gases, their yields from the specimen mass, mass loss or mass loss rate can be
    determined. This document uses Fourier-Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy
    as described in ISO 19702, with additional information on the test apparatus and
    gas analyser suitable for this specific application.
