abstract:
- content: "This document describes the phased array ultrasonic testing (PAUT) of
    polyethylene butt fusion (BF) joints, including pipe-to-pipe, pipe-to-fitting
    and fitting-to-fitting joints, used for the conveyance of fluids. This document
    provides a test, whereby the presence of imperfections such as voids, inclusions,
    lack of fusions, misalignment and particulate contamination in the BF joints can
    be detected. The document is only applicable to polyethylene pipes and fittings
    without a barrier to ultrasonic waves. \nThis document also provides requirements
    for procedure qualification and guidance for personnel qualifications, which are
    essential for the application of this test method. \nThis document also covers
    the equipment, the preparation and performance of the test, the indication assessment
    and the reporting for polyethylene BF joints. The assessment of ultrasonic indications
    and acceptance criteria are not covered in this document.\nNOTE 1  At the present
    time, laboratory experiences exist on the use of PAUT for polyethylene BF joints
    and/or reference blocks of wall thickness between 8 mm to 100 mm[1] to [5]. Recently,
    field experience on BF joints in PE80 and PE100 materials has been reported[6].\nNOTE
    2  Round robin testing has shown that PAUT is a viable method for enhancing the
    integrity assessment of BF joints[7].\nNOTE 3  PAUT techniques for cold fusion
    detection are known to be available. However further research, verification and
    experience are needed to transfer the technique into an ISO Standard. This document
    does not provide any information regarding the detection of cold fusions."
