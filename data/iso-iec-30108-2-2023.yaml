    The ISO/IEC 30108 series defines biometric services used for identity assurance that are invoked over a services-based framework. It provides a generic set of biometric and identity-related functions and associated data definitions to allow remote access to biometric services.
    Although focused on biometrics, the ISO/IEC 30108 series includes support for other related identity assurance mechanisms such as biographic and document capabilities. Identity attributes verification services (IAVSs) are intended to be compatible with and used in conjunction with other biometric standards as described in ISO/IEC 30108-1.
    This document implements the specification provided in ISO/IEC 30108-1 using representational state transfer (REST).
    Specification of biometric functionality is limited to remote (backend) services. Services between a client-side application and biometric capture devices are not within the scope of this document.
    Integration of biometric services as part of an authentication service or protocol is not within the scope of this document.
