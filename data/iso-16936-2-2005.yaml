    ISO 16936-2:2005 specifies requirements and a mechanical test method for security glazing designed to resist actions of manual attack by delaying access of objects and/or persons to a protected space for a short period of time.
    ISO 16936-2:2005 classifies security glazing products into categories of resistance against repetitive impacts of a hammer and an axe. The categories of resistance have not been assigned to special applications. Glazing classification should be specified on an individual basis for every application.
    ISO 16936-2:2005 deals with mechanical resistance to manual attack only.
