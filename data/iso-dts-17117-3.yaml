  content: "This Technical Specification uses the implementation capability definition
    (provided in ISO 17117-2 currently in development to model the maturity of terminology
    implementation in healthcare systems and identifies from that capability a maturity
    module for terminology implementation for used in EHRs and healthcare systems
    in general.\n\nThis work would be the third of a three-part set of documents.\n\nPart
    1: Terminological Resources – Characteristics (ISO 17117-1)\nPart 2: Terminology
    Implementation Capability (TIC) (at DTS)\nPart 3: Terminology Implementation Maturity
    Model (TIMM)\nDefines the progression of implementation of terminology capability
    in information systems.  The maturity model helps vendors, implementers, project
    leaders and decision makers to:\n•\tBenchmark where their organization, data collection
    or product stands in relation to others with respect to terminology implementation.\n•\tAssess
    the areas of strength and performance gaps in implementations.\n•\tIdentify specific
    steps that might be taken to close gaps and move to the next stage of maturity.\n•\tCommunicate
    progress to the broader community and within the organization.\n\nThe document
    will consider maturity for two key use cases.\n•\tpatient care.  This includes
    direct patient care, such as the use of terminologies in health records and clinical
    decision support systems including specification of maturity for minimal safe
    clinical practice to best practice.\n•\tAdministrative or statistical data collection."
