    This document specifies the use of FTIR spectrometry for determining the concentrations of individual volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in waste gases from non-combustion processes. The method can be employed to continuously analyse sample gas which is extracted from ducts and other sources. A bag sampling method can also be applied, if the compounds do not adsorb on the bag material, and is appropriate in cases where it is difficult or impossible to obtain a direct extractive sample.
    The principle, sampling procedure, IR spectral measurement and analysis, calibration, handling interference, QA/QC procedures and some essential performance criteria for measurement of individual VOCs are described in this document.
    NOTE 1    The practical minimum detectable concentration of this method depends on the FTIR instrument (i.e. gas cell path length, resolution, instrumental noise and analytical algorithm) used, compounds, and interference specific (e.g. water and CO2).
