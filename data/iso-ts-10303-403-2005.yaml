abstract:
- content: "ISO/TS 10303-403:2005 specifies the application module for AP203 configuration
    \n    controlled 3D design of mechanical parts and assemblies. \nThe following
    are within the scope of ISO/TS 10303-403:2005: \n- products that are mechanical
    parts and assemblies;\n- product definition data and configuration control data
    pertaining to the \n      design phase of a product's development;\n- representation
    of an instance of a part in an assembly through its usage \n      in a sub-assembly;\n-
    six groups of shape representations of a part that includes advanced boundary
    \n      representation, faceted boundary representation, manifold surfaces with
    \n      topology, geometrically bounded surface and wireframe geometry, wireframe
    \n      with topology, and constructive solid geometry in three-dimensions; \n-
    geometric validation properties to allow the translation of geometric \n      shape
    representations (advanced boundary representation and faceted boundary \n      representation
    solids) to be checked for quality; \n- geometric presentation of geometric shape
    representations by the application \n      of colours, layers and groups;\n- geometric
    and dimensional tolerances applied to geometric shape representations;\n- textual
    annotation and notes applied to geometric shape representations."
