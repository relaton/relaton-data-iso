  content: IEC 62264-1:2003 describes the interface content between manufacturing
    control functions and other enterprise functions. The interfaces considered are
    the interfaces between Levels 3 and 4 of the hierarchical model defined by this
    standard. The goal is to reduce the risk, cost and errors associated with implementing
    these interfaces. It can be used to reduce the effort associated with implementing
    new product offerings. The goal is to have enterprise systems and control systems
    that inter-operate and easily integrate.
