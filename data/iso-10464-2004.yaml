    ISO 10464:2004 specifies the intervals and inspection and testing procedures for the periodic inspection of refillable welded steel dedicated LPG cylinders of water capacity from 0,5 l up to and including 150 l.
    It applies to cylinders protected by a system to prevent external corrosion and designed and manufactured in accordance with ISO 4706, ISO 22991 or an equivalent design and construction standard. ISO 10464 may also apply to other refillable welded steel cylinder designs for LPG with the approval of the national authority. Cylinders for the on-board storage of LPG as a fuel for vehicles are excluded from the standard, except cylinders used for fork-lift truck applications.
