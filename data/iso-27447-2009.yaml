    ISO 27447:2009 specifies a test method for the determination of the antibacterial activity of materials that contain a photocatalyst or have photocatalytic films on the surface, by measuring the enumeration of bacteria under irradiation of ultraviolet light.
    ISO 27447:2009 is intended for use with different kinds of semiconducting photocatalytic materials used in construction materials, in flat sheet, board, plate shape or textiles that are the basic forms of materials for various applications. It does not include powder, granular or porous photocatalytic materials.
    This test method is usually applicable to photocatalytic materials produced for an antibacterial effect. Other types of performance of photocatalytic materials, i.e. decomposition of water contaminants, self-cleaning, antifogging and air purification, are not determined by this method.
    The values expressed in ISO 27447:2009 are in accordance with the International System of Units (SI).
