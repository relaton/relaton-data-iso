abstract:
- content: "ISO 18185-5:2007 specifies the air interface between electronic container
    seals and Reader/Interrogators of those seals. \nIt is to be used in conjunction
    with the other parts of ISO 18185.\nISO 18185-5:2007 describes the physical layer
    for supply chain applications of RFID for freight containers in accordance with
    the ISO 18185 series and ISO 17363, since it is expected that the implementation
    of these standards will face the same international conditions. However, each
    of these standards has its own unique requirements other than the physical layer.
    It is expected that RFID Freight Container Identification (as specified in ISO
    10374 and ISO 17363), and electronic seals (as specified in the ISO 18185 series)
    will be able to use the same infrastructure, while recognizing that that there
    may be requirements for different frequencies for passive devices as opposed to
    the active devices identified in ISO 18185-5:2007."
