    ISO/IEC 17091:2015 specifies a method for determining scanning productivity by measuring "scanning speed" and "scan to network folder speed". It includes test files, test setup procedure, test procedure, and the reporting requirements for the scanning productivity measurements. This International Standard is applicable to black and white (B&W) as well as colour digital multifunctional devices of any underlying marking technology.
    ISO/IEC 17091:2015 is applicable to devices which are able to scan a media size of A4/8,5" × 11", and which have an automatic document feeder (ADF), an ability to scan to network folder, and do not need other application programs on a computer or another devices to do a scanning job.
    ISO/IEC 17091:2015 is not intended to be use for image quality measurement, document or record management of any scanned images.
