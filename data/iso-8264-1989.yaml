abstract:
- content: A test piece, in the form of a pencil, prepared from powdered coal is heated
    at a constant rate in a steel retort positioned in a furnace, the temperature
    monitoring system having been previously calibrated using two reference metals
    of known melting points. The change in level of a piton resting upon the test
    piece is observed continuously, and record is produced which is characteristic
    of the swelling properties of the coal.
