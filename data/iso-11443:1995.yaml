abstract:
- content: Specifies methods for testing plastic melts subjected to shear stresses
    at rates and temperatures approximately to those arising in plastic processing.
    Testing plastic melts in accordance with these methods is necessary since their
    fluidity is generally not dependent solely on temperature, but also on other parameters,
    e.g. shear rate and shear stress. Methods for assessing extrudate swelling have
    also been included. The rheological techniques described are not limited to wall-adhering
    thermoplastic melts, the methods used for determining the shear rate and shear
    viscosity, however, are invalid for not wall-adhering materials.
