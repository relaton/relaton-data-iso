    This International Standard specifies the spectral characteristics of illuminants for sensitometry appropriate for
    evaluating camera films used for pictorial photography in natural daylight, studio tungsten and photoflood, including
    colour and black-and-white films, both reversal and negative types, and for evaluating black-and-white papers used
    with incandescent tungsten printers. It also describes methods for evaluating the acceptability of illuminants for
    sensitometry and specifies tolerances.
    It does not include illuminants for use with colour papers, since this would need to take account of the coloured
    mask of the negative material, for which no standard information is at present available.
