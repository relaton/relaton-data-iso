    ISO/PAS 19363:2017 defines the requirements and operation of the on-board vehicle equipment that enables magnetic field wireless power transfer (MF-WPT) for traction battery charging of electric vehicles. It is intended to be used for passenger cars and light duty vehicles.
    ISO/PAS 19363:2017 addresses the following aspects for an EV device:
    -      transferred power;
    -      ground clearance;
    -      interoperability requirements among differently classified EV devices and associated off-vehicle systems;
    -      performance requirements under various conditions, including among different manufacturers and classifications;
    -      safety requirements;
    -      test procedures.
    EV devices according to ISO/PAS 19363:2017 are intended to operate with off-board systems currently under development in the IEC 61980 series.
    NOTE 1       This edition covers stationary applications.
    NOTE 2       Bidirectional power transfer is not considered in this edition.
