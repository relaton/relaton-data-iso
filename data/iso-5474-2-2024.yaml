  content: "This document in combination with ISO 5474-1 specifies requirements for
    conductive power transfer using alternating current (AC) with a voltage up to
    1 000 V a.c. between electrically-propelled road vehicles and external electric
    circuits.\nNOTE          External electric circuits are not part of the vehicle.\nThis
    document provides requirements for conductive charging in modes 2, 3 according
    to IEC 61851-1 and reverse power transfer.\nThis document applies to vehicle power
    supply circuits. Examples of circuit diagrams for different configurations of
    chargers on-board electric vehicles are shown in Annex A. \nThis document also
    provides requirements for reverse power transfer through on-board standard socket-outlets
    and/or a EV plug or vehicle inlet according to IEC 62196-1 or IEC 62196-2 conductively
    connected to the vehicle power supply circuit. Requirements for AC power transfer
    using a charger without at least simple separation are under consideration.\nThis
    document does not provide:\n—     requirements for simultaneous operation of multiple
    EV plugs or vehicle inlets and\n—     requirements for power transfer while driving
    (electric road systems)\nbut they are under consideration.\nThis document does
    not provide:\n—     requirements for mopeds and motorcycles (which are specified
    in ISO 18246);\n—     comprehensive safety information for manufacturing, maintenance
    and repair personnel;\n—     requirements for vehicle to load adapters."
