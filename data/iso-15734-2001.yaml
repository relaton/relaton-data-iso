    This International Standard specifies performance and testing requirements for hydrostatic release units used in
    conjunction with float-free lifesaving appliances including inflatable liferafts and Emergency Position Indicating Radio
    Beacons (EPIRB 's). Hydrostatic release units which comply with this International Standard and which have been
    formally approved by the cognizant Maritime Safety Administration may be considered to comply with the 1974
    Safety Of Life At Sea Convention (SOLAS 74) and the IMO Life-Saving Appliances Code, as amended.
