abstract:
- content: 'For all hard coals two methods are specified: A) The sample is heated
    in a flask under reflux conditions with boiling toluene. The moisture from the
    coal is entrained by the toluene vapour and carried to a condenser fitted with
    a graduated receiver. The water then separates in the receiver, to from the lower
    layer, whilst the excess toluene is returned to the destillation flask by means
    of an overflow. The moisture in the coal is calculated from the volume of water
    collected. B) The sample is dried in an oven at a temperature of 105 to 110 °C
    in a current of nitrogen and the moisture calculated from the loss in mass.'
