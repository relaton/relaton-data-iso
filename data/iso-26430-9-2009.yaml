    ISO 26430-9:2009 specifies the Key Delivery Message bundle (KDMb). The KDMb is designed to deliver a set of Key Delivery Messages (KDM) from a D-cinema content processing centre to a consumer or redistributors of KDM elements (e.g. from post production to distribution, or from distribution to exhibition).
    The KDMb can represent an entire theatre, circuit or other grouping of recipients. The KDMb is a compressed archive that contains a mapping file and a directory containing a collection of one or more KDM files. The mapping file defines a relationship between a Composition Playlist (CPL), a Recipient and a KDM. The mapping file allows for a fast look-up of KDM elements for CPL or Recipient. The intent of the KDMb is to distribute a set of KDM elements in a single compressed container for improved distribution efficiencies.
