    ISO/IEC TR 12860:2009 is the first of a series of publications that explore IP-based enterprise communication involving Corporate telecommunication Networks (CNs) (also known as enterprise networks) and in particular Next Generation Corporate Networks (NGCN). The series particularly focuses on inter-domain communication, including communication between parts of the same enterprise, between enterprises and between enterprises and carriers. ISO/IEC TR 12860:2009 provides general information on the subject, defines some architectural concepts, identifies various communication scenarios, and provides a framework in support of other publications that provide greater detail on particular topics.
    The scope of ISO/IEC TR 12860:2009 is limited to communications with a real-time element, including voice, video, real-time text and instant messaging.
