    Security requirements address both hardware and software aspects.
    This document addresses the security requirements for:
    —     the transfer of TARV data from an IVS to an application service provider across a wireless communications interface;
    —     the receipt of instructions from an application service provider to a TARV IVS;
    —     the communications aspects of handling of software updates for the IVS over wireless communications.
    This document defines the requirements for telematics applications for regulated commercial vehicles for:
    a)   threat, vulnerability and risk analysis;
    b)   security services and architecture;
    c)   identity management;
    d)   security architecture and management;
    e)   identity-trust and privacy management;
    f)    security-access control;
    g)   security-confidentiality services.
    This document provides:
    —          general specifications for the security of TARV;
    —          specifications for the security of TARV transactions and data within an ITS-station "bounded secure managed domain" (BSMD);
    —          specifications for the security of TARV transactions and data transacted with a predetermined address outside of a BSMD.
    IVS security requirements are dealt with by the prime service provider and application service provider (See ISO 15638-1).
    Application service provision security is dealt with by the application service provider (and could be the subject of a separate TARV standards deliverable).
