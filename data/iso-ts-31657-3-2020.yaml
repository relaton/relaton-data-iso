    This document specifies the characteristic values for selected tilting-pad journal bearings with four or five centrally or eccentrically supported tilting pads and with angular spans of pad sliding surfaces of Ω = 80°, 60° and 45°.
    The functions plotted and listed in table form below are required for the operationally safe design of hydrodynamic tilting-pad journal bearings according to ISO/TS 31657-1. They are based on the presumptions and boundary conditions indicated there and only apply to stationary operating states. The symbols used are explained in ISO/TS 31657-1; calculation examples are also included there.
    The calculation method described in ISO/TS 31657-1 can also be used for other tilting-pad journal bearing designs, if the numerical solutions of the basic equations are available in the same manner for these designs.
