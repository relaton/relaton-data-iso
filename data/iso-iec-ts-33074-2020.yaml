    This document:
    —     defines a process assessment model that relies on the process reference model published as ISO/IEC TS 33054 that meets the requirements of ISO/IEC 33004 and that supports the performance of an assessment by providing indicators for guidance on the interpretation of the process purposes and outcomes and the process attributes as defined in ISO/IEC 33020;
    —     provides guidance, by example, on the definition, selection and use of assessment indicators.
    A process assessment model comprises a set of indicators of process performance and process capability. The indicators are used as a basis for collecting the objective evidence that enables an assessor to assign ratings. The set of indicators included in this document is not intended to be an all-inclusive set.
    The process assessment model in this document is directed at assessment sponsors and competent assessors who wish to select a model, and associated documented process method, for assessment (for either capability determination or process improvement). Additionally, it can be of use to developers of assessment models in the construction of their own model, by providing examples of good service management practices. It can be used by:
    a)   service providers to assess and improve a service management system (SMS);
    b)   service providers to demonstrate their capability for the planning, design, development, transition and delivery of services that meet agreed service management requirements.
    Any process assessment model meeting the requirements defined in ISO/IEC 33004 concerning models for process assessment can be used for assessment. Different models and methods can be needed to address differing business needs. The assessment model in ISO/IEC TS 33074 is provided as an assessment model meeting all the requirements expressed in ISO/IEC 33004.
