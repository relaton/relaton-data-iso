abstract:
- content: ISO 4081:2005 specifies the requirements for straight or pre-formed rubber
    hoses and tubing for use in pressurized or unpressurized cooling circuits containing
    1,2-ethanediol-based coolants in internal-combustion engines for vehicles with
    an unladen mass of 3,5 t or less. In addition, this specification may also be
    applied as a classification system to enable original equipment manufacturers
    (OEMs) to detail a 'line call-out' of tests for specific applications where these
    are not covered by the main types specified. In this case, the hose or tubing
    would not carry any marking showing this ISO specification number but may detail
    the OEM's own identification markings as shown on their part drawings.
