- content: |-
    This document defines the configuration rules required for a hierarchical structure, directory naming rules, and content identifiers for files and documents containing healthcare information. Content can be expressed as ISO/HL7 27931:2009 (also known as HL7 Ver2.5) as the data format to store clinical data such as prescriptions, lab results, and disease classifications, but can also include other types of file-type such as XML, CDA, DOC/DOCX, PDF, XLS/XLSX, JPEG, MP4, etc.
    This document does not address the security and privacy attributes of the healthcare information being stored; these are considered implementation-specific.
