    The purpose of ISO 22472:2016 is to provide guidance for the planning, installation and operational testing of voyage data recorder (VDR) installations according to specifications of IMO Resolution MSC.333 (90) and associated IEC 61996‑1. This International Standard mainly covers interfaces between VDR and external sensors, which are the main subject for technical agreements among users, shipyards, VDR suppliers and/or sensor manufacturers when installations are planned. In addition, matters of performance test and playback are described as well. Furthermore, details for checking of items related to the interfaces and the installation are introduced. This International Standard is not intended for the standardization of performance factors and functional requirements related to VDR.
    When whole or partial replacement of an existing simplified VDR (S-VDR) is required, this International Standard provides guidance according to the requirements of IMO Resolution MSC.163 (78) and IEC 61996‑2 for installation of the items concerned.
