abstract:
- content: Applies for the determination of natural and synthetic materials having
    a molar ratio sodium fluoride/aluminium trifluoride between 3 and 1,7 approximately.
    The method is applicable to products having an iron content equal to or greater
    than 0,020 % (m/m). The principle consists in dissolution of a test portion by
    either alkaline or acid fusion. Reduction of iron(III) with hydroxylammonium chloride,
    formation of the complex iron(II)-1, 10-phenathroline in a buffered medium at
    pH value between 3,5 and 4,2. Photometric measurement of the coloured complex
    at a wavelength of about 510 nm. Applies ISO Recommendation R 1694-1970.
