abstract:
- content: |-
    This document defines the components (benchmarks) of capability of terminological resources implementation in healthcare software products, including electronic health record systems. It is intended that these benchmarks form the basis of a maturity model. The document will support analysis of requirements to meet use cases in the implementation of terminological resources in healthcare.
    This document does not specify requirements for any specific terminological resource. It is intended to provide a basis from which requirements for terminological resources capabilities can be specified in the future. The tooling being used can impact the level of maturity reached but is not covered in detail in this document. Terminological resources include code systems of all types, terminologies, classifications, value sets, and value domains.
    The impact of tooling (computer–assisted coding, speech recognition, template development) on the capability of the terminological resources is not covered in detail in this document.
