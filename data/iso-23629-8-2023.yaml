    This document defines the generic concept and common framework of unmanned aircraft system (UAS) remote identification, which is mainly used to electronically identify an in-flight unmanned aircraft (UA). This document sets the minimum performance standards for direct remote identification.
    This document does not cover requirements for modules installed in UA or requirements for network remote identification.
    This document does not cover the identity of other information technology (IT) entities, such as the station of the remote pilot, the workstation of the fleet manager or any other connected entity.
