    This document provides a common framework of definitions and measurement methods for the design, and ergonomics testing of automotive head-up displays (HUDs) independent of technologies except where noted. Applications in both passenger cars (including sport utility vehicles and light trucks) and commercial vehicles (including heavy trucks and buses) are covered. This document does not include helmet-mounted HUDs or other head carried gear such as glasses.
    Areas covered in this document include:
    —     guidance on how to establish reference points and representative viewing conditions based on vehicle coordinates and ranges of driver's/passenger's eye points;
    —     descriptions of the HUD image geometry and optical properties measurements;
    —     definitions of the HUD virtual image and driver vision measurements;
    —     static and dynamic laboratory tests, and dynamic field operational assessments that include suggested vehicle setup procedures in order to measure HUD image attributes.
