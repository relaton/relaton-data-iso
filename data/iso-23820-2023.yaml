  content: This document specifies requirements relating to the testing method for
    AUS 32/diesel exhaust fluid (DEF) filters for the removal of suspended matter.
    This applies to urea filters dedicated to passenger vehicles as well as to commercial
    vehicles. This method applies to filters with flow rates from 3 l/h to 30 l/h
    depending on the application (by default 5 l/h for passenger vehicles and 25 l/h
    for commercial vehicles). This method can be used for other flow rates, provided
    the validation requirement can be met.
