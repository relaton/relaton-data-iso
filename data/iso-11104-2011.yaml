  content: "ISO 11104:2011 establishes a small number of standardized recommended
    time code formats for use in data interchange applications between agencies of
    the CCSDS. ISO 11104:2011 does not address timing performance issues such as stability,
    precision, accuracy, etc. \nTime codes are digital representations of time information.
    ISO 11104:2011 describes four standard recommended time codes (one \"unsegmented\"
    and three \"segmented\" codes) which use the international standard second as
    the fundamental unit of time. An unsegmented time code is a pure binary count
    of time units and fractional time units from a starting time called the \"epoch\".
    A segmented time code is one in which the count of time units and fractional time
    units is accumulated in two or more cascaded counters which count modulo of various
    bases and start from the epoch."
