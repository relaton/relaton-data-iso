abstract:
- content: |-
    ISO/IEC 29155-1:2017 identifies a framework for information technology (IT) project performance benchmarking (e.g. development or maintenance productivity) and related aspects (e.g. data collection and software classification).
    The framework consists of activities and components that are necessary to successfully identify, define, select, apply, and improve benchmarking for IT project performance. It also provides definitions for IT project performance benchmarking terms, which are also applicable to other parts of the ISO/IEC 29155 series.
    The target audience of this document are stakeholders of IT project performance benchmarking.
    NOTE       The following are examples of how this document can be used:
    -      by a benchmarking service provider who wants to align their benchmarking process to be consistent with this document;
    -      by a benchmarking user (or third-party agents) for evaluating the performance of an IT project;
    -      by an organization internally to answer specific information needs.
    ISO/IEC 29155-1:2017 does not cover how to organize benchmarking. It is out of the scope of this document to prescribe the name, format, or explicit content of the documentation to be produced from the benchmarking process.
