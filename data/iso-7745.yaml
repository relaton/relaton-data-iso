    This document specifies the operational characteristics for the various categories of fire-resistant fluids defined by ISO 6743-4. This document details the factors to be considered when selecting a    fluid from these categories for a proposed application.
    This document identifies difficulties which might arise from the use of such fluids and indicates how they may be minimized. Appropriate procedures are given for replacing one fluid with another from a different category. Health and safety aspects when handling and disposing of fire-resistant fluids are also covered.
    This document does not apply to fire-resistant fluids used in the hydraulic systems of commercial or military aircraft. The appropriate aviation standards are also usually applied where aircraft hydraulic fluids are filled into ground-based systems.
