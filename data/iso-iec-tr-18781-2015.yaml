    ISO/IEC TR 18781:2015 gives guidance on the principles and methods of testing ID cards to simulate accidental exposure to conditions encountered during the washing and drying of clothing. The physical properties of a card may degrade after exposure and the test methods described may be useful for comparing different card materials or types.
    Although there are many variations in the design and operation of washing machines, the operation of washing, rinsing, and water removal is common to all types of machine. For simplicity, one washing and drying cycle is specified, which is thought to be typical, according to industry sources. Additional wash cycles and/or different temperature conditions can be used for comparative purposes if desired.
