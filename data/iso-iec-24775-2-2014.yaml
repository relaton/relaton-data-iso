  content: "ISO/IEC 24775-2:2014(E) defines the core architecture and protocols in
    SMI-S. The components of SMI-S architecture include:      \n- Transport - communicating
    management information between constituents of the management system;                       \n-
    Health and fault management - detecting failures through monitoring the state
    of storage components;                \n- General information about the object
    model;              \n- Names - how SMI-S uses names to allow applications to
    correlate across SMI-S and to other standards;                       \n- Standard
    messages - how exceptions are presented to client applications;                                                 \n-
    Service discovery - techniques clients use to discover SMI-S services;                                                     \n-
    Installation and upgrade - recommendations for implementations;                                                                  \n-
    Compliance - requirement for compliance to the standard. This International Standard,
    together with ISO/IEC 24775-1 and ISO/IEC 24775-2 to ISO/IEC 24775-8, replaces
    ISO/IEC 24775, second edition, published in 2011, and constitutes a technical
    revision. This edition includes the following significant technical changes with
    respect to the previous edition:       \n- reorganization into eight parts;     \n-
    maturity identification using stages;\n- and new profiles."
