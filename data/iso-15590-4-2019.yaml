    This document specifies the technical delivery conditions for bends made by the cold bending process for bend with radii 5xOD or higher for use in pipeline transportation systems for the petroleum and natural gas industries as defined in ISO 13623.
    This document also specifies the requirements for the manufacture of two product specification levels (PSLs) of cold bends corresponding to product specification levels given for pipe in ISO 3183. This document is applicable to cold bends made from seamless and welded pipe of unalloyed or low-alloy steels.
    NOTE 1  These are typically C-Mn steels or low-alloy steels that are appropriate for the corresponding level and grade of line pipe in accordance with ISO 3183.
    This document is not applicable to the selection of the cold bend product specification level. It is the responsibility of the purchaser to specify the PSL, based upon the intended use and design requirements.
    NOTE 2  See also ISO 3183:2012, Introduction.
    This document is not applicable to field cold bends and pipeline bends made by other manufacturing processes.
