abstract:
- content: Serves as a guide in the co-ordination of system design, to minimize the
    variety of programs required, to promote uniformity of programming techniques,
    and to foster interchangeability of programs between NC drawings and flame cutting
    machines used in the shipbuilding industry. The "ESSI format" may be used in connection
    with any data code for punched cards, punched tapes, magnetic tapes etc. Use of
    standardized data codes is however strongly recommended.
