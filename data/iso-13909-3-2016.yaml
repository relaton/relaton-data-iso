    ISO 13909-3:2016 specifies procedures for the mechanical sampling of coal from stationary lots, for example, from wagons, barges, ships and stockpiles. These procedures are to be used when it is not possible to sample the lots during loading or discharge according to ISO 13909‑2:2016. Procedures for sample preparation are given in ISO 13909‑4:2016.
    ISO 13909-3:2016 is applicable to mechanical sampling from stationary coal lots, to obtain samples from which test samples for the determination of moisture, and for general analysis including physical and chemical tests, can be prepared in accordance with the requirements and recommendations set out in ISO 13909‑4:2016.
    In ISO 13909-3:2016, the principles and procedures for designing a sampling scheme are given, together with typical examples of applications; in addition, practices for the execution of sampling in different sampling situations are described. The methods described are limited to those on which it is possible to conduct a test for bias.
