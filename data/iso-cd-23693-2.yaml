  content: ISO 23693 part 1 aims to simulate the mechanical loads that could be imparted
    to passive fire protection (PFP) materials and systems by explosions resulting
    from the ignition of releases of flammable gas, pressurised liquefied gas, flashing
    liquid fuels or dust that may precede a fire.  Explosions can give rise to pressure
    and drag forces.  Damage to PFP materials and systems in an explosion can be caused
    by the direct effects of pressure and drag loadings and by the resulting distortion
    of the substrate supporting the PFP material. This part of the ISO 23693 series
    deals with tests to assess the performance of PFP materials applied to panels,
    plates etc that could be used as divisional elements.  The loading on this type
    of element predominantly results from the explosion pressure applied and drag
    loadings are typically minimal.
