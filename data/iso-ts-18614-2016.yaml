    ISO/TS 18614:2016 provides guidelines for users and suppliers providing the required information for requesting and specifying self-adhesive labels. It provides what to consider when defining and specifying label materials to be used for a given application.
    It will ensure that the relevant information is provided so that the right material for the intended application can be requested or recommended, as well as ensure that label parameters and characteristics are specified in a similar format to permit label materials to be requested, specified and compared in a consistent manner.
    It applies to labels with adhesive (also named as self-adhesive or pressure-sensitive).
    How to work and specify with other types of labels and marking are not addressed in ISO/TS 18614:2016, but may be the topic of subsequent documents. Also excluded is the information related to regulatory compliance.
