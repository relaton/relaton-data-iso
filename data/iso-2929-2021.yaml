    This document specifies the requirements for two groups of rubber hoses and rubber hose assemblies for loading and discharge of liquid hydrocarbon fuels with a maximum working pressure of 1,0 MPa (10 bar).
    Both groups of hoses are designed for
    a) use with hydrocarbon fuels having an aromatic-hydrocarbon content not exceeding 50 % by volume and containing up to 15 % of oxygenated compounds, and
    b) operation within the temperature range of −30 °C to +70 °C, undamaged by climatic conditions of −50 °C to +70 °C when stored in static conditions.
    NOTE      Hoses for use at temperatures lower than −30 °C can be the subject of discussion between manufacturer and end user.
    This document is not applicable to hoses and hose assemblies for LPG systems, aviation fuel systems, fuel station systems or marine applications.
