  content: Specifies methods for testing valves which are used in a circuit in order
    to determine their steady-state and dynamic performance. Requirements for test
    installations and procedures, measurements and presentation of results are specified.
    Does not establish limits of performance. Accuracy of measurement is divided into
    three classes (A, B and B) which are explained in annex A. Guidance as to the
    use of practical units for the presentation of results is given in annex B.
