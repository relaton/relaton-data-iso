    This document collects history and experience of composite cylinders and tubes to be used under the International Regulations for the Transport of Dangerous Goods:
    —    with a water capacity up to 3 000 l;
    —    with a design life greater than 15 years.
    In particular the document reviews the topic of the service life performance of existing composite cylinders and tubes and provides information and data for the following items:
    —    history of cylinder design;
    —    current testing regimes;
    —    significance of the tests on their performance;
    —    service performance including pre-fill and periodic inspection and tests.
    NOTE      In this document, for “cylinder/tube”, only the term “cylinder” is used.
