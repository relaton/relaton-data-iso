    ISO 20892:2017 specifies procedures in the preparation and carrying out of the modernization process of launch complexes and their components. These procedures are devised in case there is a need to make changes in existing configuration of launch complexes.
    ISO 20892:2017 establishes the following:
    a) modernization stages;
    b) modernization performance requirements;
    c) functions of the main participants of the modernization process and their interactions.
    The requirements specified in this document are used by organizations involved in the modernization of the launch complexes.
    ISO 20892:2017 is directly aimed at increasing economic efficiency in terms of the modernization process in creating new vehicles or changing the specification of a launch complex by a service customer, etc., or whether or not there is a need to build a new launch complex.
    ISO 20892:2017 is also aimed at providing safety and health requirements for LC personnel, since increased demand for launch complex safety may be one reason to modernize the facility.
    ISO 20892:2017 offers a unified approach to the management of the modernization process (preparation and carrying out). Since there are no specific requirements and data, target dates for the carrying out of the modernization process can be flexible.
