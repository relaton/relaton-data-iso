    This document provides requirements, specifications and guidance for an architecture of a supplier-neutral industrial digital ecosystem. It includes a standardized connectivity and services architecture, and a standardized use case architecture with methods to specify atomically re-usable scenarios and events, which can be used to specify the characteristics of standardized industry use cases.
    NOTE 1    Examples of standard industry use cases included in the secondary business process are included in Annex A along with standardized use case architecture.
    This document gives:
    —          guidance for an architecture applicable to the oil and gas, petrochemical, power generation, public utilities and other asset-intensive industries;
    —          requirements for interoperability among systems of systems, systems (including hardware and software) and components included in the secondary business process of a plant, platform or facility at any given time;
    —          guidance on how these interoperability requirements are to be achieved and sustained in support of operations in the same plant, platform or facility;
    —          specifications enabling the specialization of a digital ecosystem concept for the requirements of the secondary business process in included industries;
    —          guidance to industry participants, including owner/operators and their product and services suppliers, to support their secondary business process requirements using products, which interoperate based on the specifications included in this document.
    NOTE 2    This document is focused on interoperability requirements for systems which play roles in the secondary business process, including those in domains identified in Figure 7.
