- content: |-
    ISO 18669-1:2004 specifies the essential dimensional characteristics of piston pins of outer diameter from 8 mm up to 100 mm, for reciprocating internal combustion engines. In addition, it establishes a vocabulary, a pin-type classification, material description based on mechanical properties, common features and quality requirements. It may also be used for piston pins of compressors working under analogous conditions.
    In certain applications, except road vehicles, and provided that mutual agreement is made between the purchaser and the manufacturer, ISO 18669-1:2004 may be used with suitable modifications.
