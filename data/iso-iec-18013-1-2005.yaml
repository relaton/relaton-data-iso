    ISO/IEC 18013-1:2005 establishes the design format and data content of an ISO-compliant driving licence (IDL) with regard to the human-readable (visual) features and the placement of ISO machine-readable technologies on the card. It creates a common basis for international use and mutual recognition of the IDL without restricting individual domestic or regional driver licensing authorities from incorporating their specific needs on the IDL.
    The intent of the ID-1 sized IDL is to allow one document to serve the purpose of both what is currently known amongst driver licensing authorities as a domestic driving permit and an international driving permit (IDP). Thus the IDL replaces the need for two separate documents. Alternatively, those countries that choose to maintain their individual domestic design can issue a second card (with or without ISO machine-readable technologies), a domestic driving licence (DDL), whilst the IDL serves to replace the current IDP paper document only. ISO/IEC 18013-1:2005 also specifies an explanatory booklet with sleeve insert pocket that may optionally accompany an IDL to facilitate its world wide interpretation when used instead of an IDP.
    The IDL comprises the following:
    - minimum common mandatory data element set,
    - common layout for ease of recognition,
    - minimum set of security requirements.
    ISO/IEC 18013-1:2005 allows domestic or regional driver licensing authorities to exercise their own discretion in respect of the following aspects of the IDL in order to meet their specific needs:
    - including supplementary optional data elements (in addition to the minimum common mandatory data element set);
    - incorporating ISO/IEC JTC1/SC17 machine-readable technologies including magnetic stripe, integrated circuit with contacts, contactless integrated circuit or optical memory technology, and ISO/IEC JTC1/SC31 1-dimensional or 2-dimensional bar codes;
    - incorporating current and future technologies (including biometrics, cryptography and data compression);
    - adding physical document security elements (in addition to the mandatory elements).
    This new IDL design yields a document that
    - is more secure from counterfeiting and alteration than the IDP document;
    - allows authorities to verify the authenticity of the document;
    - integrates the personal data into a secure ID-1 size medium;
    - allows more reliable identification of the licence holder;
    - allows for machine-readable technologies;
    - facilitates information exchange and mutual recognition among driver licensing authorities;
    - allows an ISO/IEC 18013-1:2005 compliant DDL to serve simultaneously as an IDL.
