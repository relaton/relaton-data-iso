- content: |-
    This document provides the management and engineering guidelines to the software Entry profile specified in ISO/IEC 29110-4-1 through project management and software implementation processes.
    This document applies to VSEs that do not develop safety-critical software.
    This document applies for software development projects, which can fulfil an external or internal agreement.
    This document applies to start-up VSEs (e.g. VSEs that started their operation less than three years ago) and/or VSEs working on small projects (e.g. projects with a size of less than six person-months).
