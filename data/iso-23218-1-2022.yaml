    This document specifies general requirements for the design and manufacturing of numerical control systems (NC systems) for machine tools. It consists of technical and inspection requirements and test methods.
    This document is applicable to NC systems used in machine tools (including metal cutting machine tools, metal forming machine tools and woodworking machine tools) and to partial assemblies of machine tools (including cabinets and auxiliary devices) intended to be integrated into machine tools. It is also applicable to other production equipment using NC systems.
