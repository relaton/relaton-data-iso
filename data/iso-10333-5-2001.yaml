    This part of ISO 10333 specifies requirements, test methods, instructions for use and maintenance, marking,
    labelling and packaging, as appropriate, for connectors with self-closing and self-locking gates made from metallic
    materials.
    Connectors are used in personal fall-arrest systems (PFAS), which will be specified in a future International Standard
    (see ISO 10333-6 in the Bibliography), such that, if an arrest takes place, the arresting force will not exceed 6kN..
    This part of ISO 10333 is applicable only to connectors limited to single person use of a total mass not exceeding 100kg.
    .
    NOTE Users of fall protection equipment whose total mass (including tools and equipment) exceeds 100 kg are advised to seek
    advice from the equipment manufacturer regarding the suitability of this equipment, which may need additional testing.
    The scope of this part of ISO 10333 does not extend to:
    a) attachment elements, fastening buckles, adjusting buckles and other metallic fittings used in the manufacture of
    full-body harnesses, which are specified in ISO 10333-6;
    b) connectors used for material-lifting purposes;
    c) connectors used in special techniques or situations, e.g. rescue, or rope access.
    This part of ISO 10333 does not specify those additional requirements that would apply when connectors are
    subjected to special conditions of use (where, for example, there exist unusual limitations concerning access to the
    place of work and/or particular environmental factors). Thus, treatments to ensure the durability of the materials of
    construction (such as heat treatment, anti-corrosion treatment, protection against physical and chemical hazards)
    are not specified in this part of ISO 10333, but should comply with appropriate International Standards or, failing that,
    with national standards and other specifications dealing with relevant physical characteristics and/or the safety of
    users. In particular, when it is considered necessary to test the corrosion resistance of metallic parts of the
    equipment, reference should be made to ISO 9227.
