  content: "ISO/IEC 29341-26-11:2017 is compliant with [1]. It defines a service type
    referred to herein as the MediaManagement service. \nThe MediaManagement service
    enables the feature to set-up a media session on a Telephony Client (TC), under
    the control of a Telephony Control Point (TelCP). This service provides the following
    functions:\n-           Set up a media session to send and/or receive media streams
    between a TC and a TS. To set up a media session, The MediaManagement service
    provides an interface for a TelCP to negotiate the media capabilities (e.g., codec
    types, IP address, port number etc.) between a TC and a TS. This ensures a TelCP
    to select a common set of the media capabilities to be used to send and/or receive
    media streams between a TS and a TC. After the media session is established, the
    TC starts sending and/or receiving media streams based on the media chapabilities
    negotiated between the TC and the TS.\n-           The mechanism to modify the
    media capabilities of an existing media session. For instance, if a media session
    is created for sending and receiving an audio media stream, it is possible to
    modify the media session for sending and receiving a video media stream.\n-           The
    mechanism to terminate a media session."
