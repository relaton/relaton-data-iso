abstract:
- content: Cancels and replaces the first edition (1982). Establishes symbols for
    use on balancing machines including instrumentation. They are intended to complement
    those already standardized in documents such as ISO 7000. The primary purpose
    of the symbols is to explain the functions and uses of the indicators and controls
    which are an integral part of a balancing machine.
