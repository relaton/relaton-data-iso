- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: Specifies a method of determining the bulk factor of a moulding material
    from its apparent density in the unmoulded form and its density in the moulded
    form. Knowledge of the bulk factor is of importance for the calculation of the
    minimum cavity volume in the design of moulds. The bulk factor is given by the
    quotient of the density of the material in the moulded form, determined according
    ISO 1183 and the apparent density of the material in the unmoulded form, determinded
    in accordance with ISO 60 or 61.
