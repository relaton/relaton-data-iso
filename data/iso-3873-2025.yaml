    This document specifies physical and performance requirements, test methods and marking requirements for industrial protective helmets. This document describes the requirements for two helmet types.
    Type I — intended to protect the upper part of wearer’s head against impacts that may occur in an industrial setting, such as a falling object.
    Type II — intended to protect the head against impacts that may occur in an industrial setting, such as a falling object or a fall.
    NOTE            The Type II helmet is intended to offer protection from falls from standing or a low height, e.g. standing height elevated by up to one metre. The Type II helmet is not intended to offer protection to the head in all falls and is unlikely to prevent serious head injury or death in uncontrolled falls from one level to another or from a position elevated on a ladder or scaffolding. The selection of a Type II helmet should be considered as one part of an overall safe system of work in the context of working at heights and managing the risks of falls from greater than two metres.
