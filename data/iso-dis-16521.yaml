abstract:
- content: The proposed document provides the standards for the design, construction
    and inspection of concrete-filled steel tubular (CFST) hybrid structures. It is
    applicable to the static, seismic and fire design, construction and inspection
    of CFST hybrid structures to be used in high-rise buildings, largespan bridges,
    and other types of large-scale infrastructure in mountainous areas, earthquake-prone
    regions, corrosive environments and less-developed regions.
