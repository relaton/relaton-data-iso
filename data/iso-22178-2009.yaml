    ISO 22178:2009 contains the basic control strategy, minimum functionality requirements, basic driver-interface elements, minimum requirements for diagnostics and reaction to failure, and performance test procedures for low speed following (LSF) systems.
    An LSF system is primarily intended to reduce the driver's workload of repeatedly operating the accelerator and the brake pedal under congested traffic in order to keep a proper following distance behind the target vehicle for a relatively long period on roadways where there are no objects like pedestrians and bicyclists who might interrupt motorized traffic flow. An LSF system provides automatic car-following at lower speed by use of a driver interface mechanism and a speed adjustment system. The LSF system does not normally provide speed regulator control.
