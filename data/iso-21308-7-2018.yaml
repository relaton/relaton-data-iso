- content: |-
    This document series describes a generic system for the exchange of data between truck chassis manufacturers and bodywork manufacturers. It applies to commercial vehicles as defined in ISO 3833, having a maximum gross vehicle mass above 3 500 kg.
    The process of exchanging the above information can involve:
    —          chassis manufacturer;
    —          chassis importer;
    —          chassis dealer;
    —          one or more bodywork manufacturers; and
    —          bodywork component suppliers, e.g. manufacturers of demountable bodies, cranes and loading equipment, tipping equipment.
    This document specifically deals with the coding of dimensions and other characteristics of skip loaders, to ensure an efficient and unambiguous communication of installation data between the parties involved.
