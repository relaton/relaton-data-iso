  content: "This document deals with the tool capabilities and methods for model-based
    systems and software engineering (MBSSE). This document:\n—    specifies a reference
    model for the overall structure and processes of MBSSE-specific processes, and
    describes how the components of the reference model fit together;\n—    specifies
    interrelationships between the components of the reference model;\n—    specifies
    MBSSE-specific processes for model-based systems and software engineering; the
    processes are described in terms of purpose, inputs, outcomes and tasks;\n—   
    specifies methods to support the defined tasks of each process;\n—    specifies
    tool capabilities to automate or semi-automate tasks or methods.\nThis document
    does not bring any additional life cycle processes for system and software but
    specifies an MBSSE reference model considered as activities, not only from the
    life cycle perspectives of systems engineering problem solving and the system-of-interest
    evolution, but also from the cognitive perspectives of modelling and model management,
    which can sustain and facilitate the system and software life cycle processes
    during digital transformation and in the digital age. \nThe processes defined
    in this document are applicable for a single project, as well as for an organization
    performing multiple projects or an enterprise. These processes are applicable
    for managing and performing the systems and software engineering activities based
    on models within any stage in the life cycle of a system-of-interest."
