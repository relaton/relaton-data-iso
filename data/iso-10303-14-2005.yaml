abstract:
- content: |-
    ISO 10303-14:2005 specifies a language for specifying relationships between data that are governed by EXPRESS schemas, and for specifying alternate views of data that are governed by EXPRESS schemas. The language is called EXPRESS-X.
    EXPRESS-X is a structural data mapping language. It consists of language elements that allow an unambiguous specification of a relationship between EXPRESS schemas.
    The following are within the scope of ISO 10303-14:2005:
    - mapping of data governed by one EXPRESS schema to data governed by another EXPRESS schema;
    - mapping of data governed by one version of an EXPRESS schema to data governed by another version of that EXPRESS schema, where the two schemas have different names;
    - specification of requirements for data translators for data sharing and data exchange applications;
    - specification of alternate views of data defined by an EXPRESS schema;
    - an alternate notation for application protocol mapping tables;
    - bidirectional mappings where mathematically possible;
    - specification of constraints that may be evaluated against data produced by mapping.
