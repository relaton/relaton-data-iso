  content: "ISO 12161:2006 specifies methods for testing the endurance braking systems
    of vehicles of categories M, N and O (excluding M1, N1, O1 and O2), which are
    designed to comply with ECE-R 13/09 with supplements 1 to 6.\nAll endurance test
    procedures are based on the principle of equivalent energy absorption. Procedures
    which are not suitable to support this principle are not considered.\nThe principle
    of equivalent energy allows the base test parameters to be adapted to the variations
    occurring under real conditions compared to theoretical values. "
