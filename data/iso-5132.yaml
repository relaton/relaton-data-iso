  content: This method can be used to quantify propyl gallate (PG), octyl gallate
    (OG), dodecyl gallate (also called lauryl gallate) (LG), 2,4,5-trihydroxybutyrophenone
    (THBP), tert-butylhydroquinone (TBHQ), nordihydroguai¬aretic acid (NDGA), 2- and
    3-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyanisole (BHA), 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-(hydroxymethyl)phenol
    (BHT Alcohol or Ionox-100), and/or 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxytoluene (BHT) in
    oils, shortenings and animal fats at concentrations normally added to oils.  The
    method can also be used be used to determine absence of these compounds from oils
    within the limitations of the test. Applicable to animal and vegetable fats, oils
    and shortenings. The sample is diluted in hexanes, antioxidants are extracted
    into acetonitrile, diluted with isopropanol and analyzed by reversed-phase gradient
    HPLC with UV detection at 280 nm.
