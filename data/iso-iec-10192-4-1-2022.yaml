abstract:
- content: This document specifies an architecture for home cluster systems and for
    interworking among them. It specifies a cluster-to-cluster interface to enable
    interworking among home cluster systems and interoperability among the applications
    supported by these cluster systems as well as a common user interface to these
    cluster-system applications. This common user interface provides input and output
    methods for user information exchange to access, monitor and control applications
    running on home cluster systems.
