    ISO 10432:2004 provides the minimum acceptable requirements for subsurface safety valves (SSSVs). It covers subsurface safety valves including all components that establish tolerances and/or clearances which may affect performance or interchangeability of the SSSVs. It includes repair operations and the interface connections to the flow control or other equipment, but does not cover the connections to the well conduit.
    Redress activities are beyond the scope of ISO 10432:2004.
