- content: |-
    This document describes a systematic approach to assess potential occupational risks related to the dermal exposure to chemical agents at the workplace. This approach provides guidance to identify hazards, exposure routes, exposed body parts and potential consequences of exposure with respect to skin uptake and local skin effects, using qualitative and quantitative approaches.

    NOTE There is a relation between skin contamination and inadvertent ingestion.

    This document is aimed at occupational hygienists, researchers and other safety professionals to assist recognition of potential dermal exposure and its potential consequences.
