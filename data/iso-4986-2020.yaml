    This document specifies a method for the magnetic particle testing of ferro-magnetic steel and iron castings.
    It also gives acceptance criteria through severity levels defined by the nature, the area and the dimensions of the discontinuities present.
    This document is applicable to all ferro-magnetic castings, independent of the moulding method.
    A steel and iron casting is considered to be ferro-magnetic if the magnetic induction is greater than 1 T (Tesla) for a magnetic field strength of 2,4 kA/m.
    This document only applies to those areas of the castings specified for testing, as well as the percentage of castings to be tested.
