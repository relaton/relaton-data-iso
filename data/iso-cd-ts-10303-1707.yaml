    ISO/TS 10303-1707 specifies the application module for Package.
    The following are within the scope of ISO/TS 10303-1707:
    - physical shape properties of a component used in electrical design;
    - physical mounting method used in manufacturing process of attaching the component to a substrate in the assembly;
    - shape classification of the leads of a component;
    - simulation of the default mounting surface for a component shape model;
    - identification and characterization of leads of a component;
    - rigid and flexible leads of a component;
    - identification and characterization of areas on lead of a component that are allowed attachment zones;
    - orientation marks on components accessible by human or vision systems for assembly orientation;
    - polarization marks on components accessible by human or vision systems for assembly orientation;
    - pin one identification for computer applications for assembly orientation and design rule checks;
    - computer based orientation identification using standard feature classification system;
    - shape classification and representation of the body of a component;
    - definition of shape properties of a lead template for use in multiple components.
    - geometric dimensioning and tolerance data for the shape of a component;
