abstract:
- content: This document addresses the zeta-potential measurement operation for applications
    such as new product design, optimization of existing products, quality control
    during processing and/or during usage of the product. It does not provide a complete
    procedure for zeta-potential measurements. The instructions and key points addressed
    in this document are considered useful for performing zeta-potential measurements
    as specified in ISO 13099-1 and ISO 13099-2.
