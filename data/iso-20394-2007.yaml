    ISO 20394:2007 specifies the equipment and procedures for determining the effect, on the mechanical properties and moisture content of a product, of the successive cycling of the product from dry conditions at -20 °C to wet conditions (water) at +20 °C. It is applicable to thermal-insulation products.
    The method is intended to simulate freeze-thaw effects on thermal-insulation products which are frequently exposed to water and low-temperature conditions, e.g. inverted roofs and unprotected ground insulation.
    This test method is not recommended for all thermal-insulation products. It will normally be clear from the product standard, if this International Standard is applicable to a particular product.
