  content: This document specifies two methods for adaptive content automation. Firstly,
    a learning environment profile for the expression of device and learning environment
    information required for mobile learning providers of both content and services,
    and for effective use of such services. Secondly, a grouping method is specified
    so that similar learning environment profiles can be bound into one and expressed
    collectively.
