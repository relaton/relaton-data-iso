abstract:
- content: This document specifies methods of evaluating the effectiveness of glued
    laminated timber face and edge bonds within a manufacturing plant by cleaving
    of the glue line in both dry and wet conditions. It is not intended that it be
    used for initial type testing where cyclic delamination or block shear is preferred.
    It is based on the principle that, provided minimum wood failure percentages are
    met, then the bond strength exceeds the perpendicular to the grain tension strength
    of the under-lying substrate and therefore the bond is not the weak element limiting
    the integrity of a glulam assembly.
