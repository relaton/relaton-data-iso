abstract:
- content: "This document primarily specifies both general design requirements and
    guidelines for protection of operators and bystanders against electric shock and
    electrically induced fire, for voltage classes A2 (32 to 60 V DC and 21 to 30
    V AC) and B1 (60 to 75 V DC and 30 to 50 V AC), including waveform synthesized
    by power electronic converters. This standard is limited to addressing hazards
    that are not as commonly found in 12 and 24 V DC systems, including those related
    to higher power converters and drive motors. This document is applicable to electric
    systems used on:\n•\ttractors, self-propelled ride-on machines, interchangeable
    towed implements, semi-mounted implements, and mounted implements used in or with
    agriculture and forestry.\n•\tearth-moving machinery (EMM) as defined in ISO 6165
    and attachments."
