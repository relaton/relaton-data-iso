  content: "Standardization of procedures to mitigate Food Loss and Waste (FLW) by
    providing a framework for food organizations throughout the food chain to work
    actively and effectively to measure and reduce FLW across the whole food supply
    chain from the farm to the final consumers/customers.\n\nThe priority of the SC
    will be to provide the market with a new Management System Standard.\n\nThe intention
    of the proposed MSS is to embrace all food producing organizations wanting to
    reduce FLW by documenting, monitoring, improving, and reporting their procedures.
    The MSS should also provide a uniform framework for continual improvement and
    comparison of results, for use by businesses and other organizations.\n\nThe MSS
    is intended also to define measurement methods that might be used and give a comparison
    of their pros and cons.\n\nThe overall objective is that all deliverables produced
    by SC 20 shall respond to dynamic market and stakeholder needs.\n\nThe MSS specifies
    requirements for a FLW management system standard (FLW-MSS) to enable an organization
    that is directly involved in the food chain:\n\na)\tto plan, implement, operate,
    maintain and update a FLW-MS to minimize FLW within its operations;\nb)\tto contribute
    to reducing FLW throughout the food chain;\nc)\tto evaluate and assess stakeholder
    FLW requirements and demonstrate conformity or compliance with them;\nd)\tto effectively
    communicate FLW issues to interested parties within the food chain;\ne)\tto ensure
    that the organization conforms to its stated FLW policy;\nf)\tto demonstrate conformity
    to relevant interested parties;\ng)\tto seek certification or registration of
    its FLW-MS by an external organization or make a self- assessment or self-declaration
    of conformity to this document.\n\nAll requirements of the FLW-MSS will be generic
    and are intended to be applicable to all organizations in the food chain regardless
    of size and complexity. Organizations that are directly involved include, but
    are not limited to farmers, feed producers, animal food producers, harvesters
    of wild plants and animals, producers of ingredients, food manufacturers, providers
    of transportation, storage and distribution services, retailers, food banks and
    organizations providing food services or catering services.\n\nThis MSS allows
    any organization, including small and/or less developed organizations (e.g. a
    small farm, a small packer-distributor, a small retailer or a food service outlet)
    to implement externally- developed elements in their FLW-MS."
