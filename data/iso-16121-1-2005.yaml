    ISO 16121-1:2005 applies to the driver's workplace in low-floor line-service buses designed for the carriage of passengers, comprising more than eight seats in addition to the driver's seat, and having a maximum weight exceeding five metric tonnes and an overall width exceeding 2,30 m.
    It contains basic requirements for an ergonomic and comfortable seating position, which is essential to keep drivers in a good state of health. The dimensions and mounting positions of driver's seat, pedals and steering have to be carefully chosen, to enable drivers to sit in an ergonomic seating position, i.e. sitting at angles which comply with the given ranges of comfort and to allow some variation when seated.
