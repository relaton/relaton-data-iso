    The scope of ISO/IEC 24711:2015 is limited to evaluation of ink cartridge page yield for ink-containing cartridges (i.e. integrated ink cartridges and ink cartridges without integrated printheads) for colour inkjet print systems. ISO/IEC 24711:2015 can also be applied to the printer component of any multifunctional device that has a digital input printing path, including multi-function devices that contain inkjet printer components. Both liquid and solid ink products can be tested using ISO/IEC 24711:2015.
    ISO/IEC 24711:2015 is only intended for the measurement of ink cartridge page yield when printing on plain paper. No other claims can be made from this testing regarding quality, reliability, etc.
    It can be used to measure the yield of any cartridge that is used in a significant amount during the printing of the test suite defined in ISO/IEC 24712.
    It is not for use with printers whose minimum printable size is equal to or greater than A3 or for printers designed or configured to print photos (for example, maximum printable size less than A4 or a printer configuration intended for photo-only printing). In addition, it only applies to drop-on-demand printing systems.
