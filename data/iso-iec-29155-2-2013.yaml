abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 29155-2:2013 provides general requirements for processes of \"the
    information technology (IT) project performance benchmarking framework\" by prescribing:
    \n- the requirements for the processes for individual activities within the benchmarking
    framework (e.g. conduct benchmarking, maintain repository, submit data),\n- the
    tasks necessary to successfully execute activities and equip them with components,
    both of which are defined in ISO/IEC 29155-1. \n- ISO/IEC 29155-2:2013 is intended
    for use by any stakeholder(s) of IT project performance benchmarking (e.g. benchmarking
    user, benchmark provider, benchmarking service provider, and IT project team).\nThe
    following are examples of how ISO/IEC 29155-2:2013 can be used:\n- by a systems
    and software supplier to implement a benchmarking process to estimate and/or evaluate
    performance of an IT project,\n- by a systems and software acquirer (or a third-party
    agent) for evaluating the performance of the supplier's IT project,\n- by a benchmark
    provider to implement processes to collect and analyse IT project data and provide
    benchmarks,\n- by a benchmarking service provider to implement various services
    (e.g. providing instruments for benchmarking, or conducting an instance of benchmarking
    for a benchmarking user).\nISO/IEC 29155-2:2013 does not prescribe how to utilize
    benchmarking results, nor does it prescribe the name, format, or explicit content
    of the documentation that results from the benchmarking processes."
