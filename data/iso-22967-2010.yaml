abstract:
- content: "ISO 22967:2010 specifies the terminology, test procedures and general
    requirements for the construction and operation of automatic forced draught gas
    burners, and the provision of related control and safety devices. \nIt is applicable
    to automatic gas burners fitted with a combustion air fan, equipped as described
    therein, and intended for use in appliances of different types and operated with
    fuel gases, total pre‑mixed burners and nozzle mixed burners, single burners with
    a single combustion chamber, single‑fuel and dual‑fuel burners when operating
    only on gas, and the gas function of dual-fuel burners designed for simultaneous
    operation on gaseous and liquid fuels (for the latter operation, see also ISO
    22968).\nIt is not applicable to burners used in direct fired processes either
    with defined combustion chamber applications or where the combustion chamber wall
    surface temperature is greater than 750 °C or the heat‑transfer medium temperature
    is greater than 500 °C."
