    This document introduces five statistical methods for evaluating the precision of binary measurement methods and their results. The five methods can be divided into two types. Both types are based on measured values provided by each laboratory participating in a collaborative study. In the first type, each laboratory repeatedly measures a single sample. The samples measured by the laboratories are nominally identical. The second type is an extension of the first type, where there are several levels of samples.
    For each statistical method, this document briefly summarizes its theory and explains how to estimate the proposed precision measures. Some real cases are illustrated to help the readers understand the evaluation procedures involved. For the first and second types of methods, five and three cases are presented, respectively.
    Finally, this document compares the five statistical methods.
