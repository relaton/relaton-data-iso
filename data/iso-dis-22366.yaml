  content: "This document describes the principles, framework and approach toward
    energy resilience.\n\nSpecifically, this document provide:\n‒ a definition of
    energy resilience consistent with ISO 22300 (for example, Energy Resilience: ability
    of an energy supply chain to absorb and adapt in a changing environment).\n‒\ta
    set of essential organizational qualities of an energy supply chain required to
    achieve energy resilience for communities, nations and regions.\n‒\ta framework
    and concept of “Energy resilience” for any organizations to reduce unexpected
    adverse impact on an energy supply chain and adapt to changes in the operating
    environment.This is sometimes referred to as a ‘Build Back Better’ objective,
    especially after an energy supply disruption incident caused by natural or man-made
    disasters, or other crises. Energy resilience aims to enable the provision of
    stable energy supply during and after significant changes in operating environments,
    including disasters.\n‒\tframework for involving community, national and regional
    stakeholders to enhance recognition of energy supply risk context, fostering social
    capital (trust, participation and collaboration), and embracing a polycentric
    governance model for enhancing energy resilience.\n‒\t\tprinciples for recognizing
    and understanding social and technological contexts; and fostering social capital
    such as trust, broad participation and collaborative stakeholder networks.\n‒\tprinciples
    for improving the robustness, connectivity, redundancy, response diversity and
    functional diversity of an energy supply chain to enhance energy resilience.\n‒\tprinciples
    for encouraging knowledge sharing, learning and adaptation at all steps in the
    energy supply chain involving all stakeholders, including organizational change
    needed to fit new developments in energy supply chain technologies and market
    demands.\n‒\tprinciples for ensuring the structure of collaborative organizations
    involved in the supply chain have a good ‘fit’ with the structure of the built
    systems.\n‒\tprinciples for managing complexity, for example adopting mental models
    that acknowledge the complex adaptive systems nature of an infrastructure-dependent
    system being governed. Understand that linear, reductionist thinking (which is
    common in supply chains) is often a root cause of erosion of resilience.\n‒\tpreparedness
    for supply chain surprises, disruptions and disasters\n‒\tenhancement and improvement
    of energy resilience\n\nThis document is to provide framework and concept of “Energy
    resilience” to any organizations to reduce adversely impact and achieve the Build
    Back Better from incident caused by natural and human made disasters.\n\nThis
    document aims to provide a framework and principles of “Energy resilience” that
    can be utilized by any organizations in the energy supply chain, responders and
    the responsible authorities, to reduce adverse impacts of high consequence risk
    events including protection of society and communities.\n\nEnergy resilience enables
    the provision of stable energy supply during and after an incident.\n\nThe scope
    of this document will include broad resilience engineering and management principles
    applicable to a socio-technical energy supply chain but will not include guidance
    on the implementation of these principles for specialized engineering purposes.
    For example, engineering details about power generation systems, power grids and
    transmission systems, and backup generators are not included."
