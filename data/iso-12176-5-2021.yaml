    This document specifies an encoding system for data of components, assembly methods and jointing operations for polyethylene (PE) piping systems for gas, water and other industrial applications. These data can be used in a traceability system and/or used to perform the fusion of components by using equipment as specified in ISO 12176‑1 and in ISO 12176‑2.
    This encoding system is explained in ISO/IEC 16022, ISO/IEC 18004 and ISO/IEC 24778 which refer to established code types, e.g. QR code.
    Data to be encoded are: fusion cycle(s), traceability of manufactured products, other manufacturer’s information that can also be given on websites such as voluntary certificates of quality and approvals.
    This document specifies the export of data (type, format and sequence) from a data retrieval system.
    Provisions of this document are applicable to polyethylene components conforming to ISO 4427‑2, ISO 4427‑3, ISO 4437‑2, ISO 4437‑3, ISO 4437‑4 and ISO 15494, and can also be applicable to any other components used in PE systems.
    ISO 13950 and ISO 12176‑4, which partly cover the fields of application of this document, can be used in parallel.
