    This document provides general requirements for cell morphometry to quantify cell morphological features including cell shape, size and texture.
    This document addresses aspects of cell image capture using optical microscopy and image processing for morphometry.
    This document does not address the statistics associated with a morphological analysis of a cellular sample.
    This document also gives terms and definitions corresponding to cell morphological descriptors, and lists examples and their formulae, that represent quantitative cellular morphological features for evaluation of cell morphology in cell analysis.
    This document primarily applies to morphological analysis of cultured mammalian cells.
    This document is not intended for imaging used in clinical diagnostics.
