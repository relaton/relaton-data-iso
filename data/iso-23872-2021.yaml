    This document specifies the design loads and the design procedures for the design of structures used in underground mines. It covers all steel and concrete structures used in underground mines, irrespective of the depth of the mine or the product being mined.
    This document adopts a limit states design philosophy.
    Typical underground structures covered by this document include, but are not limited to:
    —    box front structures at the bottom of rock passes;
    —    conveyor gantry and transfer structures;
    —    chairlift support structures;
    —    crusher support structures;
    —    fan support structures;
    —    fixed or retractable arresting structures for ramps (see ISO 19426-5);
    —    foundations for pumps, fans, winches and underground winders;
    —    high-pressure bulkheads;
    —    monorails;
    —    overhead crane gantries for workshops, pump stations and sub shaft winder chambers;
    —    settler structures;
    —    silo bulkhead structures;
    —    silo structures;
    —    structures supporting loose rock;
    —    tip structures, including dump structures;
    —    underground head frames;
    —    ventilation control doors and other ventilation structures;
    —    walls and floors for safety bays, refuge stations and sub-stations;
    —    water control doors;
    —    water retaining structures.
    This document does not cover matters of operational safety or layout of the underground structures.
