    This International Standard specifies the characteristics of a case for use with 120 mm DVD-RAM disks as specified in
    ISO/IEC 16824. This International Standard specifies three related, but different implementations of such cases, viz.
    Type 1 Provides a case for a one-sided (Type 1S) or a two-sided (Type 2S) DVD-RAM disk such that the disk can
    not be removed from the case. This case is reversible.
    Type 2 Provides a case for a one-sided DVD-RAM disk (Type 1S) such that the disk may be removed from the
    case. This case is not reversible.
    Type 3 Provides a case into which a one-sided DVD-RAM disk (Type 1S) may be inserted, then used as a
    cartridge. This case is not reversible.
    This International Standard specifies
    -  the environments in which the cases are to be operated and stored;
    -  the dimensional and mechanical characteristics of the case, so as to provide mechanical interchangeability between data
    processing systems;
    This International Standard provides for mechanical interchange between optical disk drives. Together with 120 mm
    DVD-RAM disks according to ISO/IEC 16824 and a standard for volume and file structure, it provides for full data
    interchange between data processing systems.
