    ISO 22196:2011 specifies a method of evaluating the antibacterial activity of antibacterial-treated plastics, and other non-porous, surfaces of products (including intermediate products).
    It is not intended to be used to evaluate the effects and propagation of bacteria on non-porous surfaces without antibacterial treatments. ISO 846 describes tests to evaluate the effects and propagation of bacteria on non-porous surfaces, which are different from those covered by ISO 22196.
    Secondary effects of antibacterial treatments, such as the prevention of biodeterioration and odour, are not covered by the standard, which is not intended to be used or referenced as a method to document or claim biodegradability of, for instance, plastics materials.
    Building materials are excluded, except where they are used in the same manner as treated articles.
    Antibacterial-treated textile products are excluded, even if the surfaces are coated or laminated (such products are covered by ISO 20743).
    Photocatalytic materials and products are excluded (such materials and products are covered by ISO 27447).
