  content: |-
    ISO/IEC 19775 Extensible 3D (X3D) defines a software system that integrates network-enabled 3D graphics and multimedia. Conceptually, each X3D application is a 3D time-based space that contains graphic and aural objects that can be dynamically modified through a variety of mechanisms. This document defines the architecture and base components of X3D.
    The semantics of X3D describe an abstract functional behaviour of time-based, interactive 3D, multimedia information. This document does not define physical devices or any other implementation-dependent concepts ( e.g., screen resolution and input devices). This document is intended for a wide variety of devices and applications, and provides wide latitude in interpretation and implementation of the functionality. For example, this document does not assume the existence of a mouse or 2D display device.
