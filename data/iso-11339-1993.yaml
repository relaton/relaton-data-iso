  content: Specifies a test for the determination of the peel strength of an adhesive
    by measuring the peeling force of a T-shaped bonded assembly of two flexible adherends.
    The angle between the bond line und the direction of the applied force is not
    fixed. Adherends are separated at an approximately steady rate from an open edge
    of a prepared bond, so that separation occurs progressively along the bond line.
    The method was originally developed for use with metal adherends, but other flexible
    adherends may also be used.
