    This document specifies a method of testing the reaction-to-fire properties of an intermediate-scale, box-shaped structure made up of sandwich panels. This test method is a screening method intended for use by producers to reduce the burden of testing in ISO 13784-1, especially with respect to the occurrence of flashover.
    This test method is not applicable to determining self-standing capability during fire, which is instead examined using ISO 13784-1 or ISO 13784-2.
    This method is not intended to evaluate the reaction-to-fire performance of facades, or the fire resistance of a product, which can be tested by other means.
