    ISO/IEC 11581-10:2010 recognizes that icons are more than just symbols used on computer screens. Icons are interaction objects used by computer interfaces to accomplish various purposes. Icons can be rendered in various forms, including graphics, gesture, audio, tactile/haptics, or any combination thereof. This versatility in rendition can provide greater accessibility to their underlying functionalities.
    ISO/IEC 11581-10:2010 provides guidance for developers and designers creating and/or using icons and provides a basis for the standardization of icons. It also provides a framework for creating future parts of ISO/IEC 11581 and for identifying icon-related information to be used in any accompanying icon registries.
    It is important that icons are viewed not only as individual renditions with their associated functionality, but also that the context in which they are used is considered. ISO/IEC 11581-10:2010 gives requirements and recommendations for icons as they relate to other rendered elements, to sets of icons and to consistency among these symbols.
