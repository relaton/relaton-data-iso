abstract:
- content: As part of a drive to provide international standards for language resource
    management, ISO/TS 24620-1:2015 on controlled natural language (CNL) sets out
    the principles of CNL and its utilization together with the relevant supporting
    technology. However, ISO/TS 24620-1:2015 also aims to introduce a general view
    of CNL with its objectives and characteristics and provide a scheme for classifying
    a range of CNLs. ISO/TS 24620-1:2015 additionally specifies certain normalizing
    principles of CNLs that control the use of natural languages in particular domains
    and are also oriented towards areas of practical application. These areas include
    public administrative communications, search optimization, and the management
    of automatic question-answering systems, but the current version of ISO/TStract
    24620-1:2015 does not address any issue involving these applications directly.
