abstract:
- content: "This document describes requirements for collections of metadata about
    data elements and their containing models and datasets in a healthcare environment.
    The collection can serve as a repository or as dictionary describing a set of
    items in use in a particular domain, organisation or product for reference, or
    it can additionally serve as a registry, supporting the development and communication
    of standard items to an audience with shared goals. \nThis document specifies
    standard refinements that account for the detailed governance and administration
    requirements that are particular to healthcare data. It focuses on the description
    of data that is persisted in healthcare systems rather than the specification
    of messages between these systems. It describes necessary extensions to the ISO/IEC
    11179 series and to other International Standards on metadata originating from
    ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 32 to address the wider variety of value domain types found in
    healthcare. Where appropriate, it also suggest restrictions/simplifications to
    the ISO/IEC 11179 series that promote wider adoption without compromising interoperability
    between metadata registries and opportunities for the development of tooling that
    consumes metadata for the generation or the parameterization of code."
