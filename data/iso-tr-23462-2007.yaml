  content: "ISO/TR 23462:2007 provides a framework within which an organization can
    establish the basis for the development of programme/project management specifications
    and plans when undertaking the execution of a specific programme/project. It enables
    the programme/project manager to establish the criteria for programme/project
    success and to secure the organization's commitment to the programme/project manager's
    management approach for the overall programme/project and its constituent elements.
    It includes guidelines leading to the establishment of a programme/project management
    framework, and identification of practices to be applied. Following these guidelines
    also results in traceability of the considerations and decisions on why and how
    the programme/project is conducted according to its specific characteristics.\nISO/TR
    23462:2007 provides a holistic approach for programme/project managers to apply
    their organization's programme/project management practices when defining the
    management framework for programme/project planning. It is based on a systematic
    method of\n-        defining the programme/project objectives and success criteria,\n-
    \       identifying and elaborating the specific characteristics of their programme/project,\n-
    \       specifying the management elements needed, \n-        establishing and
    agreeing the management approaches to be implemented,\n-        compiling these
    into a programme/project management framework document.\nThe guidelines in ISO/TR
    23462:2007 are applicable to any organization undertaking the execution of space
    programmes/projects."
