  content: "This document provides a framework and guidance for a methodology for
    performing an eco-technoeconomic analysis (eTEA) based on commonly accepted best
    practices. eTEAs are used to assess and evaluate the economic and environmental
    impacts of different types of processes when applied in practice. \n\nThis document
    specifies minimum requirements for reporting the results of eco-technoeconomic
    analyses.\n\nThis document specifies the minimum requirements for communicating
    the underlying assumptions, and parameters, and methodologies used in an eco-technoeconomic
    analysis.\n\nThis document applies to process systems at any size or scale."
