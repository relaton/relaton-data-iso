    ISO/TR 18230:2015 describes a gravimetric method for the determination of the loss in mass of non-oxidized iron ores, when ignited at 1 000 °C.
    This method is applicable to a concentration range of a mass fraction of −3,0 % to 7,0 % loss on ignition in natural iron ores, iron ore concentrates and agglomerates, and sinters.
    The method is not applicable to the following:
    a)   processed ores containing metallic iron (direct reduced iron);
    b)   natural or processed ores in which the sulfur content is higher than a mass fraction of 0,2 %;
    c)   internationally traded ores with combined water greater than 2,5 %.
    NOTE 1       Loss on ignition can be used as an estimate of combined water.
    NOTE 2       This method is intended for in-house use and is not intended for referee purposes.
