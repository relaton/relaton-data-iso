  content: Fibre Channel provides a general data transport vehicle for Upper Level
    Protocols (ULPs) such as Intelligent Peripheral Interface (IPI) and Small Computer
    System Interface (SCSI) command sets, the High-Performance Parallel Interface
    (HIPPI) data framing, IP (Internet Protocol), ANSI/IEEE 802.2, and others. This
    part of ISO/IEC 14165, FC-FS, describes the framing and signalling interface of
    a high-performance serial link for support of Fibre Channel 4s associated with
    upper level protocols (e.g., SCSI, IP, SBCCS, VI). It includes additional link
    services in support of new functions defined by the Fibre Channel family of documents
    and improvements and clarifications to the definitions of existing services as
    dictated by experience with existing implementations. This standard also defines
    and includes other capabilities designed to improve the performance of existing
    Fibre Channel products and fit those products for new applications.
