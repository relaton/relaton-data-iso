abstract:
- content: Particularly in the case of earth-moving machinery, the position of the
    centre of gravity will depend upon the nature and position of any attachments
    or ancillary equipment with which the item is fitted. This Standard specifies
    a method for determining the co-ordinates of the centre of gravity of earth-moving
    machinery such as tractors, loaders, dumpers and graders in any condition of loading
    or position of attachments.
