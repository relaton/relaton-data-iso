abstract:
- content: "This document specifies requirements for factory made, self-supporting,
    double skin metal faced insulating sandwich panels where the insulating core materials
    are intended to be but not limited to cellular plastics and mineral wool as defined
    below.\nThe sandwich panels are intended for discontinuous laying in the following
    applications:\na)\troofs and roof cladding;\nb)\texternal walls and wall cladding.\nThe
    insulating core materials covered by this document are rigid polyurethane foam
    (PUR), polyisocyanurate foam (PIR), expanded polystyrene foam (EPS), extruded
    polystyrene foam (XPS), phenolic foam (PF), and mineral wool. Sandwich panels
    with edge details that utilize different materials from the main insulating core
    are included in this document.\nSandwich panels used in outdoor cold store applications
    are included in this document.\nThis document does not cover the following:\na)\tsandwich
    panels with a declared thermal conductivity for the insulating core material greater
    than 0,06 W/m²K at 10 °C;\nb)\tsandwich panels consisting of two or more clearly
    defined layers of different insulating core materials (multi-layered);\nc)\tsandwich
    panels with perforated facing(s);\nd)\tcurved sandwich panels;\nThe products covered
    by this Document shall be controlled by the manufacturer under system 1 of ISO
    12576-1. Its purpose is to provide uniform methods that are used to determine
    whether a production or a consignment of a thermal insulating material should
    be accepted as conforming to the relevant specification requirements.\nSystem
    1 of ISO 12576-1 defines the manufacturer's declaration of conformity, based on
    the manufacturer's factory production control, based on ISO9001:2000, without
    any participation of a third party."
