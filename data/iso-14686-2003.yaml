- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: ISO 14686:2003 describes the factors to be considered and the measurements
    to be made when designing and performing a pumping test, in addition to a set
    of guidelines for field practice to take account of the diversity of objectives,
    aquifers, groundwater conditions, available technology and legal contexts. The
    standard specifies the fundamental components required of any pumping test. It
    also indicates how they may be varied to take account of particular local conditions.
    It deals with the usual types of pumping test carried out for water-supply purposes,
    in which water is abstracted from the entire screened, perforated or unlined interval(s)
    of a well.
