- content: |-
    This document specifies methods for specifying decorative and protective organic coatings on aluminium and its alloys. It defines the characteristic properties of organic liquid coatings and provides testing methods with minimum performance requirements, with reference to the application and the aggressiveness of the environment in which the painted aluminium exists.
    This document is applicable to aluminium products with liquid coatings for general applications, and liquid coatings mainly processed by electrostatic liquid spraying, air spraying or airless spraying.
    This document does not apply to coil coatings on aluminium.
