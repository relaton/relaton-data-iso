- content: Specifies the minimum requirements to verify the integrity of the gas cylinders
    for further service. Does not exclude the application of additional national requirements.
    Deals with gas cylinders intended for compressed, liquefied or dissolved gases
    under pressure, excluding acetylene and LPG, of water capacity from 1 l up to
    150 l; also applies, as far as practicable, to cylinders of less than 1 l water
    capacity.
