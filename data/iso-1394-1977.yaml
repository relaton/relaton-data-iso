abstract:
- content: Specifies a simple method for detecting the presence of certain impurities
    (generally water) which, dissolved at ambient temperature, cause the formation
    of cloudiness when the product is cooled to a sufficiently low temperature. The
    principle consists in determination of the temperature at which cloudiness appears
    in the clear sample, when it is gradually cooled under specified conditions. -
    Replaces ISO Recommendation R 1394-1970.
