    This document specifies a general protocol for the observation of the meiofaunal community in the deep seabed.
    The standardized method can be used in any phase [baseline data acquisition, monitoring during and after mining (testing)] accompanying resource development, making it easier to compare data beyond differences in workers and waters.
    This document is intended for marine environment impact assessments and other occasions where long-term image-based data are required.
