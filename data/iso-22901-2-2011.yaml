    ISO 22901-2:2011 is intended to ensure that diagnostic data stream information is available to diagnostic tool application manufacturers to simplify the support of the aftermarket automotive service industry. The ODX modelled diagnostic data are compatible with the software requirements of the Modular Vehicle Communication Interface (ISO 22900-2 and ISO 22900-3). The ODX modelled diagnostic data can enable an MVCI device to communicate with the vehicle [ECU(s)] and interpret the diagnostic data contained in the messages exchanged between the external test equipment and the ECU(s). For ODX-compliant external test equipment, no software programming is necessary to convert diagnostic data into technician-readable information for display by the external test equipment.
    ISO 22901-2:2011 contains emissions-related OBD data examples described in ODX. The data examples derive from ISO 15031 (all parts).
    The emissions-related OBD ODX modelled diagnostic data describe the protocol specification from diagnostic communication of emissions-related ECUs; the communication parameters for the emissions-related OBD protocols and data link layers and for emissions-related ECU software; the related vehicle interface description (connectors and pin-out); and the functional description of diagnostic capabilities of a network of ECUs.
    ISO 22901-2:2011 is based on emissions-related diagnostic data derived and formatted according to the ISO 15765-4 DoCAN protocol. The definitions and XML representation is exemplary for all other protocols that are referenced in ISO 15031-5.
