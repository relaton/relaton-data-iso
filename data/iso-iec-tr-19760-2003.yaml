abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC TR 19760:2003 is a Technical Report that provides guidance for
    application of the International Standard ISO/IEC 15288 Systems Engineering -
    System life cycle processes in regard to systems and projects irrespective of
    size and type. ISO/IEC TR 19760:2003 can be used as a companion document to the
    International Standard by those who: \nISO/IEC TR 19760:2003 elaborates on factors
    that should be considered when applying the International Standard. It does this
    in the context of the various ways in which ISO/IEC 15288 may be applied. ISO/IEC
    TR 19760:2003 provides example application concerns lists for user consideration.
    However, ISO/IEC TR 19760:2003 is not intended to provide how-to guidance for
    each application area of the International Standard.\nGuidance is provided for
    appropriate tailoring of the International Standard for application to specific
    systems or projects.\nISO/IEC TR 19760:2003 also provides appropriate links to
    other ISO documents for supporting application of the International Standard and
    to aid in assessing the effectiveness of the application of the International
    Standard."
