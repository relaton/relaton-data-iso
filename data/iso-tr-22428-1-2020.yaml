abstract:
- content: "This document presents a model for cloud records management and outlines
    the risks and issues that are considered by records managers before adopting cloud
    services for records management. The model for cloud records management includes
    a stakeholder model, processes, metadata, architecture, and use cases. Risks and
    issues are classified into those originating from cloud services internally and
    those originating from cloud services externally. Internal risks are associated
    with cloud services, systems and stakeholders. External risks and issues can occur
    in the social and legal context in which cloud services operate.\nThe target audience
    of this document includes: \n—          records, information, knowledge, and governance
    professionals; \n—          cloud service architects; \n—          archivists
    using cloud services for managing records; \n—          developers of cloud-deployed
    records management software; \n—          ICT staff; and \n—          providers
    of cloud-based records management services."
