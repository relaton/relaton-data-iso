  content: 'A bulk sample is reduced by a mechanical process until a reduced sample
    is obtained. The reduced sample may be used for the following purposes: a) the
    preparation of a final sample or a laboratory sample of mass greater than 250
    g from a blended bulk sample of mass greater than 500 g; b) the preparation of
    several equivalent laboratory samples and/or reference samples and/or storage
    samples, each of a mass greater than 250 g, from a final sample; c) the preparation
    of a test sample from a loboratory sample.'
