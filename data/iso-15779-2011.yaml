    ISO 15779:2011 specifies requirements and test methods for components and gives recommendations for the design, installation, testing, maintenance and safety of condensed aerosol firefighting systems in buildings, plants or other structures, and the characteristics of the extinguishants and types of fire for which they are a suitable extinguishing medium. It covers total flooding systems primarily related to buildings, plant and other specific applications, utilizing electrically non-conducting condensed aerosol fire extinguishants for which there are sufficient data currently available to enable validation of performance characteristics by an appropriate independent authority.
    Local applications of condensed aerosol extinguishing systems are not covered by ISO 15779:2011. Any local applications require a pre-engineered and pre-designed system that shall be tested and approved for a specific application by a relevant authority.
