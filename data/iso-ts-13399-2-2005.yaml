abstract:
- content: "ISO/TS 13399-2:2005 specifies a reference dictionary for cutting items,
    together with their descriptive properties and domains of values, for use in cutting
    tool data representation. The reference dictionary contains definitions and identifications
    of the classes of cutting items and their features, together with an associated
    classification scheme, definitions and identifications of the data element types
    that represent the properties of cutting items and their features, and definitions
    and identifications of domains of values for describing those data element types.
    \nIt is applicable to standard data that represent the various classes of cutting
    items and cutting item features, standard data that represent the various properties
    of cutting items and cutting item features, standard data that represent domains
    of values used for properties of cutting items and cutting item features, definitions
    of reference systems for cutting items and their properties, and an implementation
    method by which the standard data defined in this Technical Specification may
    be exchanged, specified in ISO 10303-21. \nIt is not applicable to applications
    where these standard data may be stored or referenced, implementation methods
    other than the one defined in this Technical Specification by which the standard
    data may be exchanged and referenced, information model for cutting tools, definitions
    of classes and properties for tool items, definitions of classes and properties
    for adaptive items, or definitions of classes and properties for assembly items
    and auxiliary items."
