  content: Specifies a method of test and criteria for vertical and horizontal ducts
    under standardized fire conditions. The general purpose is to measure the ability
    to resist the spread of fire from one fire compartment to another without the
    aid of fire dampers. Is applicable to vertical and horizontal ducts with or without
    branches, taking into account joints, air supply and exhaust openings and suspension
    devices etc.
