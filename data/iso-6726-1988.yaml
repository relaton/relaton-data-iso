  content: Defines terms relating to the masses of mopeds and motorcycles, but does
    not deal with methods of measurement, nor with the units used in reporting the
    results, nor with the accuracy required or with the order of magnitude of the
    masses defined. Applies to mopeds and motorcycles as defined in ISO 3833. This
