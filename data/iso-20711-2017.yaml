- content: |-
    ISO 20711:2017 specifies requirements to be met with regard to resistance of the optical, mechanical, chemical and electrical properties or performance data of instruments to environmental influences and hence determines geographical and technical areas of application. It applies to consumer telescopic systems and accessories, such as hunting and sporting products.
    Environmental test methods as specified in relevant parts of ISO 9022 are assigned to the various areas of application for the purpose of ascertaining the suitability of the instruments in their respective area of application.
    ISO 20711:2017 is the basis for the specification of environmental requirements and environmental tests in instrument standards. If necessary, these requirements and tests can be amended in the instrument standards.
    ISO 20711:2017  does not deal with the requirements to be met by the packaging of the instrument during transport from the manufacturer to the user.
    NOTE          Nominal values of properties and performance characteristics as understood by this document are predetermined by specifications provided by the manufacturer, technical terms of delivery and instrument standards.
