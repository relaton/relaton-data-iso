    ISO 28219:2017
    -      defines minimum requirements for identifying items,
    -      provides guidelines for item marking with machine-readable symbols,
    -      covers both labels and direct marking of items,
    -      includes testing procedures for label adhesive characteristics and mark durability,
    -      provides guidance for the formatting on the label of data presented in linear bar code, two-dimensional symbol or human-readable form,
    -      is intended for applications which include, but are not limited to, support of systems that automate the control of items during the processes of:
    - -     production,
    - -     inventory,
    - -     distribution,
    - -     field service,
    - -     point of sale,
    - -     point of care,
    - -     repair, and
    -      is intended to include, but it is not limited to, multiple industries including:
    - -     automotive,
    - -     aerospace,
    - -     chemical,
    - -     consumer items,
    - -     electronics,
    - -     health care,
    - -     marine,
    - -     rail,
    - -     telecommunications.
    The location and application method of the marking are not defined (these will be reviewed and agreed upon by suppliers and manufacturers and their trading partners before implementing ISO 28219:2017).
    ISO 28219:2017 does not supersede or replace any applicable safety or regulatory marking or labelling requirements. ISO 28219:2017 is meant to satisfy the minimum item marking requirements of numerous applications and industry groups and as such its applicability is to a wide range of industries, each of which may have specific implementation guidelines for it. ISO 28219:2017 is to be applied in addition to any other mandated labelling direct-marking requirements.
    The labelling and direct marking requirement of ISO 28219:2017 and other standards can be combined into one label or marking area or appear as separate labels or marking areas.
    ISO 28219:2017 uses the terms "part marking" and "item marking" interchangeably. Unless otherwise stated, ISO 28219:2017 will use the term "item marking" to describe both the labelling and direct part marking (DPM) of an item, where DPM includes, but is not limited to, altering (e.g. dot peen, laser etch, chemical etch), as well as additive type processes (e.g. ink jet, vacuum deposition).
    The purpose of ISO 28219:2017 is to establish the machine-readable (linear, two-dimensional, and composite symbols) and human-readable content for direct marking and labelling of items, parts, and components.
    ISO 28219:2017 provides a means for items, parts and components to be marked, and read in either fixtured or hand-held scanning environments at any manufacturer's facility and then read by customers purchasing items for subsequent manufacturing operations or for final end use. Intended applications include, but are not limited to, supply chain applications, e.g. inventory, distribution, manufacturing, quality control, acquisition, transportation, supply, repair, and disposal.
    The figures are illustrative and not necessarily to scale or to the quality requirements specified in ISO 28219:2017.
