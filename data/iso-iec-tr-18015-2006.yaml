    The aim of ISO/IEC TR 18015 is to:
    - give the reader a model of time and space overheads implied by use of various C++ language and library features;
    - debunk widespread myths about performance problems in C++;
    - present techniques for use of C++ in applications where performance matters; and
    - present techniques for implementing C++ standard language and library facilities to yield efficient code.
    The special needs of embedded systems programming are presented, including ROMability and predictability. A separate chapter presents general C and C++ interfaces to the basic hardware facilities of embedded systems.
