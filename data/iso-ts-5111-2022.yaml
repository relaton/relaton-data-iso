  content: "This document provides guidance on the quality of water for sterilizers,
    sterilization and washer-disinfectors (WDs) used to process health care products.\nThis
    document covers the quality of water used directly for cleaning, thermal and chemical
    disinfection, rinsing and sterilization, as feedwater for the generation of steam,
    as a service to a sterilizer or WD, or as a cooling agent.\nThis document provides
    specific guidance on:\n—     water quality for different applications;\n—    
    water treatment systems;\n—     water distribution and storage;\n—     monitoring
    and control of water quality;\n—     investigating out of specification results.\nNOTE           
    Guidance given in this document can also be applied to specifications for the
    quality of water required for manual cleaning or disinfection of medical devices
    (see the ISO 17664 series).\nThis document does not supersede or modify requirements
    or test methods of published standards applying to:\n—     development, validation
    or routine control and monitoring of a sterilization process;\n—     sterilizers;
    \n—     WDs.\nThis document does not specify requirements for water treatment
    systems (see, for example, standards for particular sterilizers or WDs).\nThis
    document does not specify the water quality for manufacturing pharmaceuticals,
    cell-based health care products or medical devices.\nThis document does not provide
    guidance on the attributes of steam quality (see, for example, EN 285)."
