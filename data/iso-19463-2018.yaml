  content: "This document provides guidelines for performing routine diagnostics and
    quality assurance procedures on electron probe microanalysers (EPMA). It is intended
    to be used periodically by an instrument's operator to confirm that the instrument
    is performing optimally, and to aid in troubleshooting if it is not. It covers
    the properties of reference materials required and the analysis procedures necessary
    to independently test and fully evaluate the functionality of the main components
    of an EPMA system. \nThe analytical procedure described herein is distinct from
    single-element diagnostic procedures, which can be performed more rapidly. Such
    procedures are valid for the diffractor position and conditions under which the
    test is performed, whereas the procedure described herein is intended to qualify
    an instrument's capabilities for exploratory analysis of unknowns, trace analysis
    and non-routine work (such as peak interferences).\nThis document is applicable
    to EPMA and other wavelength dispersive spectrometer (WDS) systems in which elemental
    identification and quantification are performed by analysis of the energy and
    intensity of the characteristic X-ray lines observed in wavelength-dispersed X-ray
    spectra. It is not directly applicable to elemental analysis using energy dispersive
    spectrometry (EDS)."
