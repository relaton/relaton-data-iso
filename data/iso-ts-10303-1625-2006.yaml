  content: "ISO/TS 10303-1625:2006 specifies the application module for AP210 packaged
    part white box model. \nISO/TS 10303-1625:2006 specifies an application module
    for the representation of discrete parts using a white box model for mechanical
    analysis purposes. ISO/TS 10303-1625:2006 supports the following information:\n-
    a device model,\n- package data,\n- functional data,\n- environmental constraints,\n-
    performance data,\n- simulation models. \nAssembly arrangement of devices included
    in the package to compose the packaged part is expliclty provided. \nMapping of
    analysis model connection points to package terminals is provided. Formal encapsulation
    of external data type definitions is made for parametric data and analysis models.
    Pin mapping is provided to ensure consistency between views. \nShape, material,
    technology, tolerance on shape and on parameters, and units are included. Shapes
    included may be categorized according to discipline (e.g. thermal analysis, vibration
    analysis), and analysis environment (e.g. design, assembly, end-user). \nGeometric
    dimensioning and tolerancing is included. \nThe functional data includes two distinct
    data sets:\n- a hierarchical functional decomposition into behavioural elements
    embedded in a network represented at each level by a nodal formulation; and\n-
    a collection of device terminals (e.g. connector terminals, printed circuit board
    interface areas, jumper ends) that implement the functionality of a network node.
    \nConfiguration management information and design change management information
    is provided. \nThis data includes at least one geometric representation. \nInternal
    physical wiring information is not provided, precluding using the module for manufacturing
    purposes. \nThe following are within the scope of ISO/TS 10303-1625:2006:\n- piece
    part thermal analysis model; \n- piece part vibration analysis model; \n- piece
    part functional network analysis model. "
