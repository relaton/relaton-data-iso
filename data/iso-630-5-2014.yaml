    ISO 630-5:2014 specifies qualities for steels with improved atmospheric corrosion resistance for general structural use. It applies to steel plates rolled on a reversing mill, wide flats, hot-rolled sections and bars, which are used in the usual delivery conditions as given in 6.3, and normally intended for welded or bolted structures.
    It covers nine (9) grades and four (4) qualities. Not all grades are available in all qualities, and some qualities have Charpy V-notch requirements.
    It does not include the following structural steels, certain of which are covered by other International Standards: sheet and strip ? refer to ISO TC 17/SC 12 "Continuous mill flat rolled products"; tubular products ? refer to ISO TC 5/SC 1 "Steel tubes".
