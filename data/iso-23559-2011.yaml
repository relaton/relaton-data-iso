    This International Standard identifies specific test procedures to assist producers and users in the selection and characterization of thermoplastic films in single- or multi-layer form. It is intended to serve as a guide for those films for which there are no existing standards or specifications.
    NOTE          Because of the range of materials used and the wide variety of processes available to produce various film constructions, this document does not address specimen preparation.
    If an International Standard exists for a specific film product, the requirements of that standard shall take precedence over this document.
    There are many national, regional and industrial standards that address the requirements for specific applications. Since this International Standard is intended to provide general guidance, it is not within the scope to address these.
    The significance of the data and fitness for use shall be determined by the user.
