- content: Suitable for winding yarns and similar products (for example, tape yarns,
    roving, sliver) onto tubes or other formers. It may be applied to spinning, twisting
    and winding machinery as well as to other machines fitted with winding devices.
    All forms of winding are a combination of the rotation of the package and the
    lateral movement of the yarn relative to the package.
