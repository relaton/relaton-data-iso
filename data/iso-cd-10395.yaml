- content: |-
    This document specifies crashworthiness requirements applicable to new designs of：
    - locomotives
    - driving vehicles operating in passenger and freight trains
    - passenger rail vehicles operating in passenger trains (such as trams, metros, mainline train)
    This document identifies common methods of providing passive safety that can be adapted to suit individual vehicle requirements.
    This document specifies the characteristics of reference obstacle models for use with the design collision scenarios.
    This document also specifies the requirements and methods for demonstrating that the passive safety objectives have been achieved by comparison with existing proven designs, numerical simulation, component or full-size tests, or a combination of all these methods.
