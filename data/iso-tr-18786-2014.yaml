    ISO/TR 18786:2014 provides guidance for the assessment of the health and safety aspects of welding fabrication of metallic materials, including on-site and repair work. It applies to welding and allied processes which are covered by the following processes in accordance with ISO 4063: arc welding (process number 1); gas welding (process number 3); cutting and gouging [process number 8 (excluding 84 laser cutting)].
    For its purposes, allied processes includes joint preparation and grinding. Other processes, such as the following, might have similar health and safety aspects but are not directly addressed: soldering and brazing; thermal spraying; pre-heating and post weld heat treatments; flame straightening and mechanical straightening.
    ISO/TR 18786:2014 includes a list of hazards, harms and damages with reference to assessment procedures and a guide for possible preventive actions.
