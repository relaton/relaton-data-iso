    This document specifies the test method for evaluating possible chemical interactions between enclosures and photographic materials that are produced in a light sensitive silver halide and gelatin containing layer, processed using wet chemistry and where the final image retains metallic silver, herein referred to as silver-gelatin materials. Modified versions of the test method are applicable to chromogenic (dye coupler) and diazo photographic materials (see Annex A).
    This document is applicable to all general photographic enclosure materials used for storage, display, and transport, such as paper, tissue, cardboard, mat board and plastics. It is also applicable to components of photographic enclosure materials such as adhesives and marking substances, including inks, paints, labels, and tape. This document applies to all storage, display, and transport materials used for silver-gelatin photographs whether intended for short or long-term use (see Annex E).
    This document does not apply to non-silver-gelatin imaging systems. It does not pertain to harmful physical interactions such as blocking (sticking together), dye bleed, adhesive migration, or plasticizer exudation. It does not pertain to important criteria of enclosures such as their inherent chemical stability, physical integrity, and workmanship. Passing the photographic activity test (PAT) alone does not indicate that a material is archival. Quality requirements for photo-safe storage enclosures and their components are covered in ISO 18902, which includes passing the criteria of the PAT.
