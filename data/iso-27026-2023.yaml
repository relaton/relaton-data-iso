    This document specifies processes, requirements and recommendations for the breakdown of project management structures, collectively called project breakdown structures, in terms of the various specification (i.e. requirements), functional, product, work, cost, business and organizational breakdown structures that are established and implemented to contribute to the success of a space programme, which is often composed of one or more projects. It specifies the various types of project breakdown structures and gives processes, requirements and guidance concerning the composition of these breakdown structures.
    This document is applicable to project breakdown structures for a project, including at the top level of a programme, i.e. level 0, as indicated in ISO 14300-1. It is intended to be used either by an independent developer as a partial basis for programme processes or as a basis for an agreement between a supplier and a customer.
    This document also provides descriptions of the kinds of project breakdown structures that are commonly useful in contributing to the success of a space project. Other project breakdown structures not described in this document also often contribute to the success of a space project.
