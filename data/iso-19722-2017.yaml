    ISO 19722:2017 specifies the test method for determination of concentration of dissolved oxygen consumed due to photocatalytic oxidation of phenol in aqueous phase by semiconducting photocatalytic substances. The method is applicable to powder test sample or film test piece of semiconducting photocatalystic material targeting water contaminants. This test method is not applicable for evaluating the materials conjugated with other base material, such as organic binder which can also be decomposed by the photocatalytic activity.
    ISO 19722:2017 is applicable to the test method for the activity of powder test sample or film test piece of semiconducting photocatalystic material targeting water contaminants.
