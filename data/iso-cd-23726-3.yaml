abstract:
- content: "This document describes the Industrial Data Ontology (IDO), a Web Ontology
    Language (OWL) ontology.\nIDO is intended for industrial data and information,
    to build vocabularies and manage asset models that employ reference data libraries
    and exploit OWL DL. IDO is intended for use in all life cycle phases of industrial
    assets and processes.\nThe following are within the scope of this document:\n-\tgeneral
    overview of IDO and of the main principles,\n-\tnormative definitions of IDO classes
    and relations,\n-\tinformative examples of the use of IDO terminology in context,\n-\tre-usable
    representation patterns.\nThe following are outside the Scope of this document:\n-\tspecification
    of data modelling languages, such as RDF and OWL used in ontology development;
    and\n-\tspecification of methods for reasoning with ontologies."
