    This document reviews the methodologies or analytical models that have been used to develop the strength and stiffness of structural glued laminated timber (glulam) from the characteristic properties of lumber laminations. The review is limited to the methodologies used in Europe, the USA, Australia/New Zealand, and Canada as they represent different fundamental philosophies in these areas. As a result, the methodologies are not intended to be combined unless there is clear understanding of the fundamental assumptions adopted by the respective methodologies.
    NOTE       Detailed assumptions used by the respective methodologies are available from the standards listed in the Bibliography.
