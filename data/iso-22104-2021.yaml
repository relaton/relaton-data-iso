- content: |-
    This document specifies a method for the quantification of twelve microcystin variants (microcystin-LR, -LA, -YR, -RR, -LY, -WR, -HtyR, -HilR, -LW, -LF, [Dha7]-microcystin-LR, and [Dha7]-microcystin-RR) in drinking water and freshwater samples between 0,05 µg/l to 1,6 µg/l. The method can be used to determine further microcystins, provided that analytical conditions for chromatography and mass spectrometric detection has been tested and validated for each microcystin. Samples are analysed by LC-MS/MS using internal standard calibration.
    This method is performance based. The laboratory is permitted to modify the method, e.g. increasing direct flow injection volume for low interference samples or diluting the samples to increase the upper working range limit, provided that all performance criteria in this method are met.
    Detection of microcystins by high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) as an alternative for tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) is described in Annex A.
    An alternative automated sample preparation method based on on-line solid phase extraction coupled to liquid chromatography is described in Annex B.
    When instrumental sensitivity is not sufficient to reach the method detection limits by direct flow injection, a solid phase extraction clean-up and concentration step is described in Annex C.
