    This document specifies requirements for the design, fabrication, inspection and testing of large transportable vacuum-insulated cryogenic vessels of more than 450 l volume, which are permanently (fixed tanks) or not permanently (demountable tanks and portable tanks) attached to a means of transport, for one or more modes of transport.
    This document applies to large transportable vacuum-insulated cryogenic vessels for fluids specified in 3.1 and does not apply to vessels designed for toxic fluids.
    This document does not include the general vehicle requirements, e.g. running gear, brakes, lighting, etc.
    NOTE 1    This document does not cover specific requirements for refillable liquid-hydrogen tanks that are primarily dedicated as fuel tanks in vehicles. For fuel tanks used in land vehicles, see ISO 13985.
    NOTE 2    This document does not cover specific requirements for refillable liquid hydrogen and LNG tanks that are primarily dedicated as fuel tanks in vehicles. For fuel tanks used in vehicles, see ISO 13985.
