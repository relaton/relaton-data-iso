    ISO/TS 14904:2002 specifies the interfaces for clearing between operators and gives a framework of the common message structure and data elements to be used on the interfaces. Its objective is to make the transfer of payment and Electronic Fee Collection (EFC) related data possible both between different payment systems and between different operators such as collection agents, clearing operators, or providers of public and private transport services.
    ISO/TS 14904:2002 supports:
    It is not within the scope of ISO/TS 14904:2002 to define administrative procedures and organisational structures. The specification of a higher (e.g. pan-European) level inter-operable payment system is outside the scope of ISO/TS 14904:2002.
    Not described within ISO/TS 14904:2002 are indirect (external) participants such as authorities, enacting general or special legislation concerning the payment system and other national regulations.
    The models presented in this standard are generic. Simple systems (closed systems) can be designed by selecting subsets of the interface framework described herein.
