  content: "ISO 9564-1:2011 specifies the basic principles and techniques which provide
    the minimum security measures required for effective international personal identification
    number (PIN) management. These measures are applicable to those institutions responsible
    for implementing techniques for the management and protection of PINs during their
    creation, issuance, usage and deactivation.\nISO 9564-1:2011 is applicable to
    the management of cardholder PINs for use as a means of cardholder verification
    in retail banking systems in, notably, automated teller machine (ATM) systems,
    point-of-sale (POS) terminals, automated fuel dispensers, vending machines, banking
    kiosks and PIN selection/change systems. It is applicable to issuer and interchange
    environments.\nThe provisions of ISO 9564-1:2011 are not intended to cover:\na)
    PIN management and security in environments where no persistent cryptographic
    relationship exists between the transaction-origination device and the acquirer,
    e.g. use of a browser for online shopping; \nb) protection of the PIN against
    loss or intentional misuse by the customer; \nc) privacy of non-PIN transaction
    data; \nd) protection of transaction messages against alteration or substitution;
    \ne) protection against replay of the PIN or transaction; \nf) specific key management
    techniques; \ng) offline PIN verification used in contactless devices;\nh) requirements
    specifically associated with PIN management as it relates to multi-application
    functionality in integrated circuit (IC) cards."
