  content: Specifies a rapid and accurate method for evaluating the corrosion resistance
    characteristics of electrodeposits on steel or zinc-base die casting designed
    for outdoor service. Does not describe exposure periods to be used for a specific
    product, nor the interpretaiton to be given to the results. Test conditions are
    provided to electrolytically dissolve the underlying coatings of nickel through
    discontinuities in the chromium overlay at such a rate that electrolysis for 2
    min produces about the same extent of corrosion as does 1 year of service.
