    ISO 19125-1:2004 establishes a common architecture for geographic information and defines terms to use within the architecture. It also standardizes names and geometric definitions for Types for Geometry.
    ISO 19125-1:2004 does not place any requirements on how to define the Geometry Types in the internal schema nor does it place any requirements on when or how or who defines the Geometry Types. ISO 19125-1:2004 does not attempt to standardize and does not depend upon any part of the mechanism by which Types are added and maintained.
