  content: "This document specifies a method for the detection, semi-quantitative
    and quantitative (MPN) enumeration of thermotolerant Campylobacter species. \nThe
    method can be applied to all kinds of waters including: drinking water, ground
    water and well water, fresh, brackish and saline surface water, swimming pools,
    spa and hydrotherapy pools, recreational waters, agricultural waters and runoff,
    untreated and treated wastewater and also sand and other sediments. \nThis method
    can be used for the detection of Campylobacter species in a specified sample volume.
    Clean water samples with low turbidity can be membrane filtered for either a qualitative
    method, semi-quantitative or quantitative (MPN) method. Water samples with higher
    turbidity, such as primary and secondary wastewater effluents and sediments, are
    analysed using the same qualitative, semi-quantitative or quantitative MPN method
    by direct inoculation of material into bottles or tubes. Sediments can be suspended
    in a suitable diluent or inoculated directly into enrichment broths.\nUsers wishing
    to employ this method are expected to verify its performance for the particular
    matrix under their own laboratory conditions."
