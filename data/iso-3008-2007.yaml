    ISO 3008:2007, used in conjunction with ISO 834-1, specifies a method for determining the fire resistance of door and shutter assemblies designed primarily for installation within openings incorporated in vertical separating elements, such as hinged and pivoted doors, horizontally sliding and vertically sliding doors, including articulated sliding doors and sectional doors, steel single-skin folding shutters (un-insulated), other sliding, folding doors, tilting doors, rolling shutter doors and removable panels in walls.
    This method can also be used to determine the fire resistance of non-loadbearing horizontal doors by analogy. However, these are not specifically addressed here and the field of direct application is not valid for horizontally oriented doors.
    No requirements are included for mechanical conditioning, e.g. "shakedown" or durability, as these are included in the relevant product standard, nor for smoke leakage testing of doors and shutters; for the latter, see ISO 5925-1.
