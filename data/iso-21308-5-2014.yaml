    The ISO 21308 series describes a generic system for the exchange of data between truck chassis manufacturers and bodywork manufacturers. It applies to commercial vehicles as defined in ISO 3833, having a maximum gross vehicle mass above 3 500 kg.
    The process of exchanging the above information can involve chassis manufacturers, chassis importers, chassis dealers, one or more bodywork manufacturers, and bodywork component suppliers, e.g. manufacturers of demountable bodies, cranes and loading equipment, and tipping equipment.
    ISO 21308-5:2014 specifically describes the coding dimensions and other characteristics of loader cranes and auxiliary stabilizers, to ensure an efficient and unambiguous communication of installation data between the parties involved.
    ISO 21308-5:2014 covers loader cranes as specified in ISO 15442, designed to be fitted on commercial vehicles (including trailers).
    ISO 21308-5:2014 is not applicable to other load-lifting systems (e.g. tail lifts, hook loader systems).
