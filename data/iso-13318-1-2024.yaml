abstract:
- content: "This document specifies the principles of particle size analysis by centrifugal
    liquid sedimentation (CLS). It also:\n— defines the relevant terms;\n— describes
    the various measurement techniques;\n— gives guidance for sample preparation,
    conducting measurements as well as data analysis;\n— establishes rules for method
    validation, determination of the uncertainty budget as well as representation
    of results. \nAn important part of this document deals with the derivation of
    particle size distributions from CLS data, including discussions on:\n— the impact
    of Brownian motion;\n— the parallel determination of particle concentrations;\n—
    the working range with respect to size and concentration;\n—the handling of non-spherical
    and porous particles.\nThis document applies to samples composed of dispersions
    of low particle concentration, so that the particles’ motion can be considered
    as that of fully isolated particles. This document does not cover particle migration
    by gravity, electric or magnetic forces. It also does not cover deriving particle
    properties other than size, sedimentation velocity and sedimentation coefficient.\nNOTE           
    This document can involve hazardous materials, operations and equipment. It does
    not purport to address all the safety problems associated with its use. Regulations
    regarding explosion-proof analysers can apply when examining volatile liquids
    with a low flash point. It is the responsibility of the user of this document
    to establish appropriate safety and health practices and to determine the applicability
    of the regulatory limitations prior to its use."
