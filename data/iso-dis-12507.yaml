abstract:
- content: This document specifies a basic laboratory test method for deinkability
    of woodfree printed paper products under alkaline conditions by means of single
    stage flotation deinking and fatty acid-based collector chemistry. The woodfree
    printed paper product of interest is tested as a mixture containing 10% by weight
    of the woodfree printed paper with the balance comprising a mixture of mechanical
    pulp based printed paper products.
