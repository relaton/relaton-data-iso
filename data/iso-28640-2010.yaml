  content: "ISO 28640:2010 specifies methods for generating uniform and non-uniform
    random variates for Monte Carlo simulation purposes. Cryptographic random number
    generation methods are not included. ISO 28640:2010 is applicable, inter alia,
    by\n- researchers, industrial engineers or experts in operations management, who
    use statistical simulation, \n- statisticians who need randomization related to
    SQC methods, statistical design of experiments or sample surveys,\n- applied mathematicians
    who plan complex optimization procedures that require the use of Monte Carlo methods,
    and\n- software engineers who implement algorithms for random variate generation."
