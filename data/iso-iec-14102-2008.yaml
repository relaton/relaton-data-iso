    (CASE) tools represent a major part of the supporting technologies used to develop
    and maintain information technology systems. Their selection must be carried out
    with careful consideration of both the technical and management requirements.\nISO/IEC
    14102:2008 defines both a set of processes and a structured set of CASE tool characteristics
    for use in the technical evaluation and the ultimate selection of a CASE tool.
    It follows the software product evaluation model defined in ISO/IEC 14598-5:1998.\nISO/IEC
    14102:2008 adopts the general model of software product quality characteristics
    and subcharacteristics defined in ISO/IEC 9126-1:2001 and extends these when the
    software product is a CASE tool; it provides product characteristics unique to
    CASE tools. This larger set of characteristics is then organized into four groups:\n-
    characteristics related to life cycle process functionality; \n- characteristics
    related to CASE tool usage functionality; \n- general quality characteristics;\n-
    general characteristics not related to quality. \nThis grouping provides a more
    manageable approach to the overall evaluation and selection process.\nThe technical
    evaluation can indicate how well a CASE tool meets its user's stated requirements.
    It can also indicate how well the tool meets its claimed functionality.\nThe objective
    of the technical evaluation process is to provide quantitative results on which
    the final selection can be based. Measurement assigns numbers (or other ratings)
    to attributes of entities; a major activity of evaluation is to obtain these measurements
    for use in selection. The final selection results should aim to achieve objectivity,
    repeatability and impartiality. These objectives and the confidence in the outcomes
    will in part depend on the resources allocated to the overall evaluation and selection
    process. The user of ISO/IEC 14102:2008 is asked to deal with these issues at
    an early stage.To be widely acceptable, these CASE tool evaluation and selection
    processes must be of value to the users of CASE tools, and to the suppliers of
    CASE to the community at large. The information outlined in ISO/IEC 14102:2008
    should lead to more cost effective selections of CASE tools and to a greater uniformity
    in how CASE tool functions and features are described."
