    This document establishes a method of using geographic location referencing (GLR) that can be used by relevant TPEG applications. The GLR type, defined in this document, is used for defining geographic location references (points, polylines and geographical areas). The GLR method is intended to be one of the methods that can be transported inside a TPEG-Location Referencing Container (TPEG-LRC) for those TPEG applications providing information for primarily geographical locations (e.g. weather).
    The GLR specification is deliberately kept basic and compact, so that it can also be employed advantageously in non-navigation devices, for simple TPEG services such as weather information, safety alerts, etc. As such, the GLR location referencing method is intended to be complementary to map-related location referencing methods, where the focus is on the referencing of anthropogenic artefacts such as roads and highways.
    For this reason, the scope of GLR is limited to geographic locations on the Earth’s surface.
