    This document contains the basic control strategy, minimum functionality requirements, basic driver interface elements, minimum requirements for diagnostics and reaction to failure, and performance test procedures for Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) systems.
    ACC systems are realised as either Full Speed Range Adaptive Cruise Control (FSRA) systems or Limited Speed Range Adaptive Cruise Control (LSRA) systems. LSRA systems are further distinguished into two types, requiring manual or automatic clutch. Adaptive Cruise Control is fundamentally intended to provide longitudinal control of equipped vehicles while travelling on highways (roads where non-motorized vehicles and pedestrians are prohibited) under free-flowing and for FSRA-type systems also for congested traffic conditions. ACC can be augmented with other capabilities, such as forward obstacle warning. For FSRA-type systems the system will attempt to stop behind an already tracked vehicle within its limited deceleration capabilities and will be able to start again after the driver has input a request to the system to resume the journey from standstill. The system is not required to react to stationary or slow moving objects
