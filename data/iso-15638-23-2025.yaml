abstract:
- content: |-
    This document addresses the provision of tyre pressure monitoring (TPM) services. It specifies the form and content of the transmission data required to support TPM systems (TPMS) and the access methods for these data.
    This document provides specifications for common communications and data exchange aspects of the TPM application service that a jurisdiction regulator or operator can elect to require or support as an option, including:
    a)       a high-level definition of the service that a service provider has to provide [the service definition describes common service elements (SEs), but does not specify the detail of how such an application service is instantiated, nor the acceptable value ranges of the data concepts defined];
    b)       the means to realize the service;
    c)        application data naming, content and quality that an in-vehicle system (IVS) has to deliver, including a number of TPM profiles or data (noting that requirements and constraints of what can/cannot be transmitted over the air can vary between jurisdictions);
    d)       support for a number of defined communication profiles to enable remote inspection.
    This document provides specifications for the following application profiles:
    —     Application profile A1: the cyclical initiation of TPM message by on-board equipment (TPM-C).
    —     Application profile A2: the exceptional initiation of TPM message by on-board equipment (TPM-E).
    —     Application profile A3: the provision of TPM data as the result of an off-board request (TPM-R).
    —     Application profile A4: The provision of TPM data as the result of an off-board reading of tyre pressures of vehicles which can potentially be unequipped (TPM-O).
