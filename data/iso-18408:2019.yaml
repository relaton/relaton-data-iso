    This document applies to reinforced concrete building consisting of load bearing walls of reinforced concrete buildings [such buildings are called reinforced concrete box-shaped wall buildings and (RC wall building)] or to the part of RC wall building which uses both this and other types of structure.
    This document applies to RC wall building as follows:
    —          RC wall building with 5 or fewer aboveground storeys;
    —          eaves height of 16 m or less;
    —          storey height on each storey of 3 m or less;
    —          on the top storey, the storey height can be 3,3 m or less;
    —          if the roof has a slope, the sum of the storey height of the top storey and the height from the eaves to the ridge of 4 m or less.
    Deep foundations, such as piles and caissons, and their pile footings and caps, are beyond the scope of this document, and are not covered by it.
