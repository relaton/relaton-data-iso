  content: The determination may be carried out in two different ways by the ethanol
    method or the barium chloride method. In the first case the soap is dissolved
    in neutralized ethanol, and the free caustic alkali is titrated with an ewthanol
    solution of hydrochloric acid. The second way includes precipitating of soap and
    carbonate with barium chloride and determining of the residual alkalinity of the
    solution, representing the alkalinity of the free potassium hydroxide.
