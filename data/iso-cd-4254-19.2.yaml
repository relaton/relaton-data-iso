abstract:
- content: "This document, used together with ISO 4254-1, specifies the safety requirements
    and their verification for the design and construction of livestock feed and bedding
    machines that have a combination of two or more of the following functions loading,
    mixing, chopping and distributing materials . In addition, it specifies the type
    of information on safe working practices to be provided by the manufacturer.\n\nNOTE\tLivestock
    feed and bedding machines (for example feed mixers, bale processors, silage block
    cutters) can be stationary, mounted, semi-mounted, interchangeable towed or self-propelled.\nWhen
    requirements of this document are different from those which are stated in ISO
    4254-1, the requirements of this document take precedence over the requirements
    of ISO 4254-1 for machines that have been designed and built according to the
    requirements of this document.\nThis part of ISO 4254 is not applicable to:\n—
    machines which pick up or transport crop material directly from the field;\n—
    loading cranes;\n—automated, semi-autonomous and autonomous functions (for example,
    those covered by ISO 3991) \n— the integrity of safety-related parts of control
    systems in relation to the specification of performance levels; \n— environmental
    hazards (excluding noise), road safety and hazards associated with moving transmission
    parts; \n— hazards associated with maintenance or repairs carried out by professional
    service personnel.\nThis document deals with the significant hazards, hazardous
    situations and events relevant to machines for loading, mixing and/or chopping
    and distributing silage and/or other feedstuffs, when they are used as intended
    and under the conditions foreseen by the manufacturer as listed in Annex A, except
    for the hazards arising from:\n— failure of the control circuit;\n— inadequate
    seating;\n— inadequate lighting;\n— travelling of machinery related to road safety;\n—
    break-up of parts rotating at high speed;\nThis document is not applicable to
    machines manufactured before the date of publication of this document.\nExamples
    of machines and components covered by this document are shown in Annex B."
