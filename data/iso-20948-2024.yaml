    This document specifies a method for the determination of the aflatoxins B1, B2, G1 and G2 in vegetable fats and oils, including peanut oil, sesame oil, olive oil, corn oil, sunflower oil, rapeseed oil and coconut oil, using immunoaffinity column clean-up and high-performance liquid chromatography with post-column derivatization.
    The limits of quantification for the aflatoxins B1, B2, G1 and G2, and for the sum of aflatoxins B1, B2, G1 and G2, are 1 μg/kg, 0,25 μg/kg, 0,5 μg/kg, 0,25 μg/kg and 1 μg/kg, respectively.
    The validation was carried out over the following concentration ranges:
    —     aflatoxin B1 = 1 μg/kg to 20 μg/kg;
    —     total aflatoxins = 2 μg/kg to 52 μg/kg.
