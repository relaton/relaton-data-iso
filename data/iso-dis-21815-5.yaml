abstract:
- content: "This document defines requirements for collision warning (CWS) and collision
    avoidance systems (CAS) that address other forms of motion than forward/reverse
    and rotation for:\n— earth-moving machinery as defined in ISO 6165,\n— mobile
    underground mining machinery as defined in ISO 19296, rock drill rigs as defined
    in ISO 22935-5, and\n— road construction machinery as defined in ISO 22242.\nClauses
    5, 6, 7, and 8 do not consider machine height beyond that of height in travel
    position as established by machine manufacturer.\nThe requirements for  forward
    / reverse motion are stated in ISO 21815-3:2023 and for swing/rotation motion
    in ISO 21815-4:20XX.\nThis document covers\n— collision warning and avoidance
    for articulation movement by speed reduction, stopping, or motion inhibit,\nNote:
    Steering the machine whilst in forward/reverse motion is not considered as articulation
    motion.\n— collision warning and avoidance for 4-wheel steer motion by speed reduction,
    stopping, or motion inhibit,\n— collision warning and avoidance for motion of
    towed trailers in reverse by speed reduction, stopping, or motion inhibit,\n—
    collision warning and avoidance for differential speed, skid turning, counter
    rotation motion by speed reduction, stopping, or motion inhibit,\n—\tcollision
    warning and avoidance for telescopic extension/ retraction motions, and\n—\tcollision
    warning and avoidance for vertical motions i.e. height or depth\nFor articulation
    this document considers\n•\ta stationary machine when an articulation command
    is given\n•\tduring articulation, where no linear motion takes place (i.e. forward
    / reverse).\nThis document does not cover avoidance by automatic manoeuvring (e.g.
    steering) away from the object.\nThe system described in this standard is intended
    to assist the operator of the machine.   The responsibility for safe operation
    of the machine remains with the machine operator.\nThis document is not applicable
    to collision warning and collision avoidance systems installed or manufactured
    before the date of its publication.\nMachines that are double articulated are
    excluded from the scope of this document."
