    This document provides details about the aggressiveness factors, evaluation indicators of raw water, or inlet water of ductile iron pipe system and relevant lining information applicable to ductile iron pipes, fittings and accessories used in water mains and distribution system.
    This document is intended to serve as a tool for estimating the properties of certain water and their effect on internal linings of ductile iron pipes, fittings and accessories used in water mains and distribution system which are specified in ISO 2531, ISO 16631 and can be used to decide the most appropriate protective measures to ensure long term durability of pipeline.
    It is not always possible to definitively determine the aggressive parameters of certain water, and fully considered by limited test and evaluation. Therefore, the history information of the evaluated water, experiences of local water works can be taken for reference.
    The aggressiveness evaluation of water can be carried out before determining the internal lining materials of certain pipeline, and the evaluation and relevant tests can be done by qualified laboratories and engineers.
    Water that leads to high-level scaling in the pipeline is believed aggressive.
    Drainage and waste water are not in the scope of this document, the internal protection of drainage and waste water can be recommended by pipe suppliers.
