    ISO 19237:2017 specifies the concept of operation, minimum functionality, system requirements, system interfaces, and test procedures for Pedestrian Detection and Collision Mitigation Systems (PDCMS). It specifies the behaviours that are required for PDCMS, and the system test criteria necessary to verify that a given implementation meets the requirements of this document. Implementation choices are left to system designers wherever possible.
    PDCMS reduce the severity of pedestrian collisions that cannot be avoided, and may reduce the likelihood of fatality and severity of injury. PDCMS require information about range to pedestrians, motion of pedestrians, motion of the subject vehicle (SV), driver commands and driver actions. PDCMS detect pedestrians ahead of time, determine if detected pedestrians represent a hazardous condition, and warn the driver if a hazard exists. PDCMS estimate if the driver has an adequate opportunity to respond to the hazard. If there is inadequate time available for the driver to respond, and if appropriate criteria are met, PDCMS determine that a collision is imminent. Based upon this assessment, PDCMS will activate CWs and vehicle brakes to mitigate collision severity. This document, while not a collision avoidance standard, does not preclude a manufacturer from implementing collision avoidance with PDCMS.
    Systems that include other countermeasures such as evasive steering are not within the scope of this document.
    Responsibility for the safe operation of the vehicle remains with the driver.
    ISO 19237:2017 applies to light duty passenger vehicles (see 3.6). It does not apply to other vehicle categories such as heavy vehicles or motorcycles. PDCMS are not intended for off-road use.
