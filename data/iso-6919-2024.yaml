- content: |-
    This document defines procedures and requirements for measuring liquefied natural gas (LNG) from truck-to-ship (TTS) using the combination of Coriolis mass flowmeter (MFM) and gas chromatography (GC). It also gives guidance and requirements for portable packaging of the combination system in mobile form which minimizes facility storage space and streamlines the use of development systems. Output from the system in calorie units is applicable to commercial transactions between suppliers and users of liquefied natural gas (LNG) as marine fuel.
    This document also consists of general requirements, metrological requirements, system flawless requirements, requirements and test methods, and procedures for measurement methods.
