  content: "This document identifies quality metrics for the detection of DNA variants
    using next generation sequencing (NGS) technology. It also defines the data types,
    relationships, optionality, cardinalities and terminology bindings of the data.
    \nThis document provides a basis for sharing and for the application of \"high
    quality\" genomic data and contributes to the realization of the precision medicine
    and the development of relevant industries.\nThis document is intended to serve
    as a catalogue of sequencing data elements used to address quality metrics for
    various clinical, industrial and commercial applications. The exchange of these
    data allows researchers, commercial entities, and regulatory bodies to assess
    for the purpose of selective utilization of the data by setting application-specific
    quality criteria\nThis document is not intended for\n—          sequencing methods
    other than NGS, such as the Sanger sequencing,\n—          targets other than
    genome, such as transcriptome or proteome, or\n—          specimens of species
    other than humans."
