    ISO/TS 21219-14:2016 specifies the TPEG Parking Information application which has been designed to deliver parking information to a variety of receivers using a number of different channels, foremost of course are digital broadcasting and Internet technologies. Parking information may be presented to the user in many different ways, including text, voice, or graphics.
    Today, traffic congestion has become a serious problem in urban areas. Some traffic congestion is attributed to drivers searching for parking spaces. Therefore, timely provision of parking information could help ease traffic congestion. Furthermore, parking information would be valuable for the visitor, particularly when it could be used to signal where a temporary parking facility is established for a special occasion.
