    ISO/ASTM 15702 outlines dosimetric procedures to be followed in irradiator characterization, process qualification, and routine processing in a gamma irradiation facility. These procedures ensure that all product processed with ionizing radiation from isotopic gamma sources receive absorbed doses within a predetermined range. Other procedures related to irradiator characterization, process qualification and routine processing that may influence absorbed doses in the product are also discussed.
    Dosimetry is one component of a total quality assurance programme for an irradiation facility. Other controls besides dosimetry may be required for specific applications such as medical device sterilization and food preservation.
