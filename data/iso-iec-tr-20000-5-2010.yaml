  content: "ISO/IEC TR 20000-5:2010 is an exemplar implementation plan providing guidance
    to service providers on how to implement a service management system to fulfil
    the requirements of ISO/IEC 20000-1 or for service providers who are planning
    service improvements and intending to use ISO/IEC 20000 as a business goal. It
    could also be useful for those advising service providers on how to best achieve
    the requirements of ISO/IEC 20000-1.\nISO/IEC TR 20000-5:2010 includes advice
    for service providers on a suitable order in which to plan and implement improvements.
    It is suggested that a generic three-phase approach is used to implement a service
    management system. The phased approach provides a structured framework to prioritize
    and manage the implementation activities. \nISO/IEC TR 20000-5:2010 includes advice
    on development of a business case, the start up project, and a list of the main
    activities required to implement ISO/IEC 20000-1 successfully for each phase.
    It also provides supporting information, advice and guidance that may be useful
    for the implementation project, including developing objectives, developing policies,
    document and record management and sample process documentation.\nISO/IEC TR 20000-5:2010
    is for guidance only. The service provider has the option of choosing their own
    implementation sequence to implement a service management system."
