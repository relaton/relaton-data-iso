    This document specifies requirements for applying and documenting methods for determining particulate contamination on functionally-relevant components and systems (cleanliness inspection) of road vehicles.
    A cleanliness inspection comprises the basis of an assessment of technical cleanliness, which is performed, for example, under the following circumstances:
    —          initial inspection and evaluation;
    —          inspection of incoming and outgoing components; and
    —          quality control or monitoring of manufacturing processes relevant to cleanliness (e.g. cleaning, surface treatment and assembly processes).
    This document is intended to improve the informative quality and comparability of test results. It also defines the standardized expression of cleanliness specifications and cleanliness test results in the quality chain of the automotive industry.
    This document does not apply to the following:
    —          detection of filmy contamination (grease, oils, etc.);
    —          application of non-quantifiable particulate detection methods on test components (e.g. visual assessment, wipe test with clean cloth, etc.); and
    —          characterization of operating fluids (fuel, oils, coolants, brake fluid, etc.).
    This document does not define any cleanliness limit values for specific components or systems. The degree of cleanliness required for a specific component or system is dependent on a number of highly-individual factors. Cleanliness specifications are intended to be undertaken only by specialists who not only know the component concerned but also the system it is built into, the later conditions of use, technically-feasible practices and possible consequences for manufacturing processes and the supply chain. Guidance for deriving limit values can be found in Annex H.
