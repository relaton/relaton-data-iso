  content: "ISO/IEC 18043:2006 provides guidance for an organization that decides
    to include an intrusion detection capability within its IT infrastructure. It
    is a \"how to\" for managers and users who want to: understand the benefits and
    limitations of IDS; develop a strategy and implementation plan for IDS; effectively
    manage the outputs of an IDS; integrate intrusion detection into the organization's
    security practices; and understand the legal and privacy issues involved in the
    deployment of IDS. \nISO/IEC 18043:2006 provides information that will facilitate
    collaboration among organizations using IDS. The common framework it provides
    will help make it easier for organizations to exchange information about intrusions
    that cut across organizational boundaries. \nISO/IEC 18043:2006 provides a brief
    overview of the intrusion detection process; discusses what an IDS can and cannot
    do; provides a checklist that helps identify the best IDS features for a specific
    IT environment; describes various deployment strategies; provides guidance on
    managing alerts from IDSs; and discusses management and legal considerations."
