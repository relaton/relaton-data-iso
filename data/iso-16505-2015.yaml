  content: ISO 16505:2015 gives minimum safety, ergonomic, and performance requirements
    for Camera Monitor Systems to replace mandatory inside and outside rearview mirrors
    for road vehicles. It addresses Camera Monitor Systems (CMS) that will be used
    in road vehicles to present the required outside information of a specific field
    of view inside the vehicle. These specifications are intended to be independent
    of different camera and display technologies unless otherwise stated explicitly.
    ADAS Systems (such as parking aid) are not part of ISO 16505:2015.
