    This document covers the activities performed by perfusionists before, during, and after extracorporeal circulation.
    Clause 4 covers the perfusionists' actions during preoperative extracorporeal circulation (ECC) equipment setup prior to cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), cardiopulmonary support (CPS), left or right heart bypass (LHB/RHB) or venovenous (VV) extracorporeal support for liver transplantation. Its requirements can serve as a checklist for verifying that the equipment, devices or systems have been set up correctly. The sequence of use of checklist items listed below can vary depending on customary institutional use or individual user preference. There are also four additional checklists for different phases of ECC (see Clause 5, Termination; Clause 6, Post-extracorporeal circulation; Clause 7, Emergent reinstitution of extracorporeal circulation; and Clause 8, Peri-procedural).
