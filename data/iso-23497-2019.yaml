    This document specifies requirements for technical buffer solutions. These buffer solutions are preferably used for the calibration and adjustment of technical pH measuring equipment as well as pH measuring installations in laboratories. Measuring methods are given to determine pH values and buffer capacities of such buffer solutions based on pH reference buffer solutions in accordance with ISO 23496.
    NOTE       Annex A gives examples of technical buffer solutions.
