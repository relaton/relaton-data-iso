abstract:
- content: "ISO 18381:2013 establishes a data compression algorithm applied to digital
    three-dimensional image data from payload instruments, such as multispectral and
    hyperspectral imagers, and specifies the compressed data format.\nData compression
    is used to reduce the volume of digital data to achieve benefits in areas including,
    but not limited to:\n- reduction of transmission channel bandwidth;\n- reduction
    of the buffering and storage requirement;\n- reduction of data-transmission time
    at a given rate.\nThe characteristics of instrument data are specified only to
    the extent necessary to ensure multi-mission support capabilities. ISO 18381:2013
    does not attempt to quantify the relative bandwidth reduction, the merits of the
    approaches discussed, or the design requirements for encoders and associated decoders.
    \nISO 18381:2013 addresses only lossless compression of three-dimensional data,
    where the requirement is for a data-rate reduction constrained to allow no distortion
    to be added in the data compression/decompression process."
