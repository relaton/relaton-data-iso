- content: |-
    The evolution of the harmonized set of ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288-12207 related
    standards and technical reports that are discussed in this International Standard
    provides detailed requirements and guidance on the application of system life cycle
    processes. This International Standard unifies technical and management
    requirements and guidance from several of these sources to specify the requirements
    for the content of a SEMP and to provide a common SEMP format. This International
    Standard also identifies the processes as defined in ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 to perform
    the necessary project planning activities to accomplish the project's technical effort and
    to develop the project's SEMP. Due to close alignment with the content of
    ISO/IEC 24748, ISO/IEC 26702 is now Part 4 of the multi-part International Standard,
    ISO/IEC 24748 (Systems and software engineering ? Life cycle management).
