    This document specifies the types, structure, dimensions and technical requirements of manifolds for oil and chemical tankers.
    It applies to the cargo and vapour piping systems for the transfer of cargoes of oil or chemical tankers.
    NOTE       This document can be also be applied to the design of bunker (ship fuel) transfer system manifolds for oil or chemical tankers at terminals. ISO 23212 is generally applicable to flanged connections for bunker fuel and lubricating oil transfer to ships from supply vessels or onshore facilities.
