    ISO 17096:2015 specifies safety requirements for the following non-fixed load lifting attachments for cranes, hoists, and manually controlled load manipulating devices as defined in Clause 3:
    -      plate clamps;
    -      vacuum lifters;
    -      self priming,
    -      non-self-priming (pump, venturi, turbine);
    -      electric lifting magnets (battery-fed and main-fed);
    -      permanent lifting magnets;
    -      electro-permanent lifting magnets;
    -      lifting beams/spreader beams;
    -      C-hooks;
    -      lifting forks;
    -      clamps.
    ISO 17096:2015 does not specify the additional requirements for the following:
    a)    load lifting attachments in direct contact with foodstuffs or pharmaceuticals requiring a high level of cleanliness for hygiene reasons;
    b)    hazards resulting from handling hazardous materials (e.g. explosives, hot molten masses, radiating materials);
    c)    hazards caused by operation in an explosive atmosphere;
    d)    hazards caused by noise;
    e)    electrical hazards;
    f)     hazards due to hydraulic and pneumatic components.
    ISO 17096:2015 does not cover attachments intended to lift people.
    ISO 17096:2015 does not cover slings, ladles, expanding mandrels, buckets, grabs or grab buckets, and container spreaders.
