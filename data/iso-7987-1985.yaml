abstract:
- content: Specifies the nomenclature appropriate to each part of the machine (in
    English and French, and the eqivalent terms in German, Spanish, Italian and Swedish)
    and the geomatrical tests for these turning lathes, and gives the corresponding
    permissible deviations which apply to machines of general purpose use and normal
    accuracy. It deals only with the verification of the accuracy of the machine.
    It does not apply to the testing of the running of the machine nor to its characteristics
    which should generally be checked before accuracy is tested. Does not impose any
    practical test.
