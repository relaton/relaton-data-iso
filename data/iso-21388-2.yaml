  content: "This document is a supplement to ISO 21388 which applies to hearing aid
    fitting management (HAFM) services offered by hearing aid professionals (HAP).
    It focusses on tele-services which may substitute, or complement services defined
    in ISO 21388, and it defines services which shall be provided in the facilities
    of the HAP. Moreover, this document specifies important preconditions such as
    education, facilities and systems that are required to ensure proper tele-services.
    If not other stated all definitions and requirements of ISO 21388 also apply for
    this standard without further notice. Furthermore, it is tried to keep the structure
    if ISO 21388 to make it easier to use both standards together. It is recognized
    that certain populations with hearing loss such as children, persons with other
    disabilities or persons with implantable devices can require services outside
    the scope of this document. \nOther assisted tele-services provided by non-hearing
    aid professionals, self-fitting, and other non-hearing care related will also
    be outside of the scope."
