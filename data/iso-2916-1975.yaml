abstract:
- content: The method is applicable to undyed wool in any form, for example loose
    fibre, sliver, yarn or fabric. It is also applicable to dyed wool when the amount
    of dye extracted during the test does not interfere with the determination of
    the end-point of titration. The determined value is expressed as a percentage
    by mass.
