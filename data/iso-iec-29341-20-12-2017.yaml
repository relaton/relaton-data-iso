abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 29341-20-12:2017 specifies the characteristics of the UPnP networked
    service named ContentDirectory, version 4. This service definition is compliant
    with UPnP Device Architecture 1.0 [14].  \nMany devices within the home network
    contain various types of content that other devices would like to access (for
    example, music, videos, still images, etc). As an example, a MediaServer device
    might contain a significant portion of the homeowner's audio, video, and still-image
    library. In order for the homeowner to enjoy this content, the homeowner needs
    to be able to browse the objects stored on the MediaServer, select a specific
    one, and cause it to be played on an appropriate rendering device (for example,
    an audio player for music objects, a TV for video content, an Electronic Picture
    Frame for still-images, etc). \nFor maximum convenience, it is highly desirable
    to let the homeowner to initiate these operations from a variety of UI devices.
    In most cases, these UI devices will either be a UI built into the rendering device,
    or it will be a stand-alone UI device such as a wireless PDA or tablet. In any
    case, it is unlikely that the homeowner will interact directly with the device
    containing the content (that is: the homeowner won't have to walk over to the
    server device). In order to enable this capability, the server device needs to
    provide a uniform mechanism for UI devices to browse the content on the server
    and to obtain detailed information about individual content objects. This is the
    purpose of the ContentDirectory service. \nThe ContentDirectory service additionally
    provides a lookup/storage service that enables clients (for example, UI devices)
    to locate (and possibly store) individual objects (for example, songs, movies,
    pictures, etc) that the (server) device is capable of providing. For example,
    this service can be used to enumerate a list of songs stored on an MP3 player,
    a list of still-images comprising various slide-shows, a list of movies stored
    in a DVD-Jukebox, a list of TV shows currently being broadcast (a.k.a an EPG),
    a list of songs stored in a CD-Jukebox, a list of programs stored on a PVR (Personal
    Video Recorder) device, etc. Nearly any type of content can be enumerated via
    this ContentDirectory service. For devices that contain multiple types of content
    (for example, MP3, MPEG2, JPEG, etc.), a single instance of the ContentDirectory
    service can be used to enumerate all objects, regardless of their type."
