abstract:
- content: Gives the characteristics of machine cutting blowpipes and the specifications
    and corresponding test. Applies to machine cutting blowpipes which are fitted
    to a gas cutting machine and which have cylindrical barrels where the nozzle centre
    is coaxial with the barrel, the blowpipe operates with oxygen and fuel gas and
    has a cutting range from 3 mm to 300 mm cutting thickness.
