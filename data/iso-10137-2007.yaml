    ISO 10137:2007 gives recommendations on the evaluation of serviceability against vibrations of buildings, and walkways within buildings or connecting them or outside of buildings.
    It covers three recipients of vibrations: human occupancy in buildings and on walkways; the contents of the building; the structure of the building.
    It does not include bridges that carry vehicular traffic, even in conjunction with pedestrian traffic, nor the design of foundations or supporting structures of machinery.
