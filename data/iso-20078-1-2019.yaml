    This document defines the different concepts, entities and roles involved in implementing and delivering ExVe web services. In addition, it also gives an overview of the necessary activities that should be executed by the different roles involved and a logical order for those activities.
    This document defines the concept of identifiers (direct and correlated), different Resource categories (e.g. personal, vehicle related, pseudonymized and anonymized Resources) and different approaches on how to bundle sharable Resources (e.g. Resource Group or Container).
