  content: ISO/TS 16332:2006 specifies a fuel/water separation test with continuous
    water injection, using an offline water concentration measuring method, for evaluating
    the ability of a fuel filter to separate either finely or coarsely dispersed undissolved
    water out of fuel. This test is intended for application to filter elements which
    are installed upstream or downstream of the low pressure pump, having a rated
    flow between 50 l/h and 900 l/h. By agreement between customer and filter manufacturer,
    and with some modification, the procedure may be used for fuel filters with higher
    flow rates.
