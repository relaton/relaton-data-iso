  content: This document presents a vocabulary of terms related to, and systems for
    the designation and marking of, wheels and rims intended for use with pneumatic
    tyres. The intention is to define fundamental wheel and rim terms rather than
    provide a comprehensive tabulation of all wheel design features. Also specified
    are the content, location and minimum size of the wheel and rim marking, with
    the purpose of establishing, on a worldwide basis, a uniform identification system
    for wheels and rims.
