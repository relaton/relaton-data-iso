    This document defines, describes and classifies the characteristics of damage occurring in service to hydrodynamically lubricated metallic plain bearings and journals. It assists in the understanding of the various characteristic forms of damage which can occur.
    Consideration is restricted to damage characteristics which have a well-defined appearance and which can be attributed to particular damage causes with a high degree of certainty. Various appearances are illustrated with photographs and diagrams.
