- content: |-
    This document gives methods of determination of characteristic values for a defined population of mechanical connections between timber components, calculated from full scale test values.
    It presents methods for the determination of:
    a)    slip modulus of mechanical connections;
    b)    characteristic strength of connections subjected to either monotonic or cyclic loads.
    Glued connections are excluded from the scope of this document.
    NOTE 1    It is assumed that the failure mode is the same for all specimens in the sample.
    NOTE 2    When a small number of test results is available, ISO 12122‑6 is used for the determination of the mean and the 5th percentile values.
    NOTE 3    Informative commentary to the clauses of this document can be found in Annex A.
