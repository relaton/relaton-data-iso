abstract:
- content: "This International Standard specifies safety requirements, and measures
    for their verification, for the design and construction of portable, hand-held,
    internal combustion engine-driven machines for abrasive chains, intended to be
    used by a single operator in the cutting of construction materials, such as concrete,
    stone and metal. It is applicable only to those machines designed purposely for
    use with a water-cooled abrasive chain only, where the top of the abrasive chain
    rotates away from the operator. \n\n\nISO 19432-2 is not applicable to:\nCut-off
    machines for centre-mounted rotating abrasive wheels, which are covered by ISO
    19432-1.\nChain saws for forestry service, which are covered by ISO 11681-1.\nChain
    saws for tree service, which are covered by ISO 11681-2.\n\nNOTE: Clarification
    of product class; machinery in the scope of this standard, is designed to only
    cut  construction materials, such as concrete, stone, metal and the like. The
    cutting means is by grinding with an abrasive chain through the work-piece, using
    a continuous water supply as a coolant, lubricant and dust suppression. This kind
    of machinery is not intended for use with conventional wood cutting saw chain
    with defined sharpened cutting edges.\nThis International Standard deals with
    all significant hazards, hazardous situations or hazardous events significant
    to these machines when they are used as intended and under conditions of misuse
    which are reasonably foreseeable by the manufacturer. (See Annex X for a list
    of significant hazards.) \n\nThis International Standard specifies methods for
    the elimination or reduction of hazards arising from their use, as well as the
    type of information on safe working practices to be provided with the machines."
