  content: "This practice covers dosimetric procedures to be followed in installation
    qualification, operational qualification and\nperformance qualification (IQ, OQ,
    PQ), and routine processing at electron beam facilities to ensure that the product
    has been treated with an acceptable range of absorbed doses. Other procedures
    related to IQ, OQ, PQ, and routine product processing that may influence absorbed
    dose in the product are also discussed.\nThe electron beam energy range covered
    in this practice is between 80 and 300 keV, generally referred to as low energy.\nDosimetry
    is only one component of a total quality assurance program for an irradiation
    facility. Other measures may be required for specific applications such as medical
    device sterilization and food preservation.\nOther specific ISO and ASTM standards
    exist for the irradiation of food and the radiation sterilization of health care
    products. For the radiation sterilization of health care products, see ISO 11137-1.
    In those areas covered by ISO 11137-1, that standard takes precedence. For food
    irradiation, see ISO 14470. Information about effective or regulatory dose limits
    for food products is not within the scope of this practice (see ASTM F1355 and
    F1356).\nThis document is one of a set of standards that provides recommendations
    for properly implementing dosimetry in radiation processing, and describes a means
    of achieving compliance with the requirements of ISO/ASTM 52628. It is intended
    to be read in conjunction with ISO/ASTM 52628.\nThis standard does not purport
    to address all of the safety concerns, if any, associated with its use. It is
    the responsibility of the user of this standard to establish appropriate safety,
    health, and environmental practices and determine the applicability of regulatory
    limitations prior to use.\n \nThis international standard was developed in accordance
    with internationally recognized principles on standardization established in the
    Decision on Principles for the Development of International Standards, Guides
    and Recommendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical Barriers
    to Trade (TBT) Committee."
