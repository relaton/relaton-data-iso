    This document specifies a method for the determination of selected perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in non‑filtrated waters, for example drinking water, natural water (fresh water and sea water) and waste water containing less than 2 g/l solid particulate material (SPM) using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC‑MS/MS). The compounds monitored by this method are typically the linear isomers. The group of compounds determined by this method are representative of a wide variety of PFAS. The analytes specified in Table 1 can be determined by this method. The list can be modified depending on the purpose for which the method is intended. The lower application range of this method can vary depending on the sensitivity of the equipment used and the matrix of the sample. For most compounds to which this document applies ≥0,2 ng/l as limit of quantification can be achieved. Actual levels can depend on the blank levels realized by individual laboratory.
    The applicability of the method to further substances, not listed in Table 1, or to further types of water is not excluded, but is intended to be validated separately for each individual case.
    NOTE 1    PFAS is used in this document to describe the analytes monitored. Many of the compounds in Table 1 are perfluoroalkyl and are also considered polyfluoroalkyl substances.
    NOTE 2    The linear PFAS isomers are specified in this document. The branched isomers can be present in environmental samples, especially for PFOS. Annex E provides an example of an analytical approach to the chromatographic and spectroscopic separation of individual isomers.
