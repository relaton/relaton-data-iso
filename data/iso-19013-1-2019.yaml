abstract:
- content: "This document specifies the requirements for rubber tubing and hoses used
    in diesel fuel circuits for internal combustion engines. The diesel fuels covered
    include \"bio-diesels\" which consist of the methyl ester of rape seed oil at
    levels up to 20 % by volume in conventional diesel fuels. \nThis document can
    also be applied as a classification system to enable original equipment manufacturers
    (OEMs) to detail a \"line call-out\" of tests for specific applications where
    these are not covered by the main types specified (see example in Annex E). In
    this case, the hose or tubing would not carry any marking showing the number of
    this document but can detail the OEM's own identification markings as shown on
    their part drawings."
