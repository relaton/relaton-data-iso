    This document specifies test methods applicable to unidirectional carbon fibre-reinforced polymer (CFRP) strips as external-bonded reinforcements on the concrete substrate.
    This document is applicable for the CFRP strips that:
    —                                      consist of carbon fibre and thermoset resin;
    —                                      are manufactured by pultrusion method;
    —                                      have a higher carbon fibre fraction such as over 60 %; and
    —                                      have a thickness within 3 mm.
    Also, the test pieces for determining tensile properties are cut down from CFRP strips along the CFRP strips axis, and have bonded anchorage block at the both ends.
