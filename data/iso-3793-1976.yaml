abstract:
- content: The method consists in acetylating the hydroxyl groups containing compounds
    with a mixture of acetic anhydride and pyridine. The excess of acetic anhydride
    is hydrolized and the acetic acid formed is titrated with a potassium hydroxide
    solution. Primary and secondary alcoholes are acetylated completely by this method.
    Phenols, anthranilates and aldehydes are acetylated either completely or partially.
    Tertiary alcohols are acetylated only in a negligible extent.
