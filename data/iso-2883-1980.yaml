  content: These limits are generally appropriate for the products listed. If, however,
    an International Standard has been issued for an individual product, the method
    specified there shall be used. Does not apply to articles whose surfaces are composed
    of mixtures of insulating and conducting areas or articles with substantial surface
    area of insulating material. A defined system of electrodes is used for the test.
    The system is suited to factory inspection or service testing.
