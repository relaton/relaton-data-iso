    This document specifies requirements for materials used in vulcanized rubber seals for the following:
    a)       cold drinking-water supplies (up to 50 °C);
    b)       drainage, sewerage, and rainwater systems (continuous flow up to 45 °C and intermittent flow up to 95 °C).
    The different designations of seals specified are defined according to their type, application, and requirements (see Table 5).
    General requirements for finished joint seals are also given; any additional requirements called for by the particular application are specified in the relevant product standards, taking into account that the performance of pipe joints is a function of the seal material properties, seal geometry, and pipe joint design. This document is intended to be used, where appropriate, with product standards which specify performance requirements for joints.
    This document is applicable to joint seals for all pipeline materials, including iron, steel, clay, fibre cement, concrete, reinforced concrete, plastics, and glass-reinforced plastics.
    It is applicable to elastomeric components of composite or non-composite seals. In the case of composite seals for materials of hardness ranges from 76 IRHD-M to 95 IRHD-M, the requirements for elongation at break, compression set, and stress relaxation apply only when the material is participating in the sealing function or in the long-term stability of the seal.
    Joint seals made with an enclosed void as part of their design are included in the scope of this document.
