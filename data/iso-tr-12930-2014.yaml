  content: ISO/TR 12930:2014 provides seismic design examples for geotechnical works
    based on ISO 23469:2005 in order to demonstrate how to use this ISO standard.
    The design examples are intended to provide guidance to experienced practicing
    engineers and code writers. Geotechnical works include buried structures (e.g.
    buried tunnels, box culverts, pipelines, and underground storage facilities),
    foundations (e.g. shallow and deep foundations, and underground diaphragm walls),
    retaining walls (e.g. soil retaining and quay walls), pile-supported wharves and
    piers, earth structures (e.g. earth and rock fill dams and embankments), gravity
    dams, tanks, landfill and waste sites.
