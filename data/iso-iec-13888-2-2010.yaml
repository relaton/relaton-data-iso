  content: "The goal of the non-repudiation service is to generate, collect, maintain,
    make available and validate evidence concerning a claimed event or action in order
    to resolve disputes about the occurrence or non-occurrence of the event or action.
    ISO/IEC 13888-2:2010 provides descriptions of generic structures that can be used
    for non-repudiation services, and of some specific communication-related mechanisms
    which can be used to provide non-repudiation of origin (NRO) and non-repudiation
    of delivery (NRD). Other non-repudiation services can be built using the generic
    structures described in ISO/IEC 13888-2:2010 in order to meet the requirements
    defined by the security policy. \nISO/IEC 13888-2:2010 relies on the existence
    of a trusted third party (TTP) to prevent fraudulent repudiation or accusation.
    Usually, an online TTP is needed. \nNon-repudiation can only be provided within
    the context of a clearly defined security policy for a particular application
    and its legal environment. Non-repudiation policies are defined in ISO/IEC 10181-4. "
