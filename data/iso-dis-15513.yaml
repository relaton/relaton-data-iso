    This International Standard gives competency requirements applicable for the selection, training, assessment and
    verification of crane drivers (operators), slingers, signallers and their assessors.
    This International Standard does not cover additional competency requirements needed for special operations, e.g.
    man-lifting, pile-driving or pile-pulling.
    NOTE 1 Responsibilities for the performance of tasks are given in ISO 12480-1. However, personnel need to be aware of the
    responsibilities of others; inclusion in the training programme should not infer any changes in responsibilities.
    NOTE 2 For training of drivers (operators), see ISO 9926.
