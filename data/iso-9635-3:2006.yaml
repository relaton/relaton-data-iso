  content: ISO 9635-3:2006 specifies construction and performance requirements and
    test methods for check valves, intended for operation in irrigation systems with
    water at temperatures not exceeding 60 °C, which can contain fertilizers and other
    chemicals of the types and concentrations used in agriculture. It is applicable
    to hydraulically operated check irrigation valves of DN 15 (1/2 inch) diameter
    or greater, designed to operate in the fully open and fully closed positions,
    but which can also operate for extended time periods in any intermediate position.
