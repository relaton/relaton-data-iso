    This document describes methods for the sample preparation of smelter-grade aluminium oxide. It covers the reduction of a bulk sample between 1 kg and 20 kg to produce a sample that is suitable for chemical and physical analysis. The reduced sample produced will be representative of the initial bulk sample. The bulk sample is considered to be from one source.
    The methods are suitable for dry, free-flowing aluminium oxide.
    As the moisture content will influence many physical analyses, the method aims to minimize the exposure of the sample to the atmosphere to avoid water absorption.
