    ISO/TS 29584:2012 examines test methods currently employed to determine the pendulum impact performance of safety glass. Use of the methodologies in ISO/TS 29584:2012 improves the reproducibility of test results and gives a common basis of classification. The aim is for the performance of glass products manufactured and tested in various countries to be better understood and accepted.
    ISO/TS 29584:2012 evaluates, by means of soft body impactors, safe breakage characteristics of glazing products intended to reduce cutting and piercing injuries to persons through accidental impact.
    ISO/TS 29584:2012 defines two types of soft body impactor. The traditional shot bag impactor is detailed both in terms of manufacture and maintenance in an attempt to overcome problems associated with such impactors becoming misshapen. The twin tyre impactor is also detailed.
    ISO/TS 29584:2012 also describes the test equipment, excluding the impactor. A method of calibrating the test frame is given. The benefit of calibrating the test equipment is the increased reproducibility of the test results.
    ISO/TS 29584:2012 also details the classification of glass products. ISO/TS 29584:2012 does not specify the intended use of the products, but provides a method of classification in terms of the performance of the materials being tested. The impact energy used for the various levels of classification are designed to provide the intended user or the legislator with the information to assist in defining the level of safety and protection required relative to the intended location at which the selected safety glass is to be used.
