    1 Scope
    This part of ISO 7148 specifies tribological tests of metallic bearing materials for plain bearings under conditions of boundary lubrication.
    The test procedures described in this part of ISO 7148 enable the friction and wear behaviour of bearing material/mating/lubricant combinations to be compared with that of other combinations, thus facilitating the selection of a bearing material for running repeatedly or for long periods under conditions of boundary lubrication, low speed and continuous sliding. Owing to differences in test conditions, measured friction and wear values can be expected to vary from one test facility to another.
    The test results give useful information for practical application only if all parameters of influence are identical. The more the test conditions deviate from the actual application, the greater the uncertainty of the applicability of the results.
