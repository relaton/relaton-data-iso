abstract:
- content: This document specifies a laboratory test method for screening anti-fouling
    paints in a flow-through system using mussels as the test organism. It is intended
    to be used in conjunction with ISO 21716-1, which specifies the general requirements.
    The purpose of the test is to determine if there is a difference in mussel settlement
    on painted test panels compared with mussel settlement on inert non-toxic control
    panels under the conditions of the test. Examples of statistical analysis to determine
    if the difference in mussel settlement is statistically significant are given
    in Annex A.
