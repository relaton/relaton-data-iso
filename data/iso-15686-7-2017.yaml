    ISO 15686-7:2017 provides a generic basis for performance evaluation for feedback of service life data from existing buildings and constructed assets, including a definition of the terms to be used and the description of how the (technical) performance can be described and documented to ensure consistencies.
    The purpose of this document is to describe the principles for service life performance surveys and evaluation with an emphasis on technical recommendations. It describes a generic methodology, including the terms to be used, that provides guidance on the planning, documentation and inspection phases, as well as on analysis and interpretation of performance evaluations, both on the object (single building) and network (stock of buildings) level. While maintenance planning is outside the scope of this document, maintenance-driven inspections and subsequent recommended actions could have significant effects upon service life and performance.
