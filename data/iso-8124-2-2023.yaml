    This document specifies the categories of flammable materials that are prohibited in all toys, and requirements concerning flammability of certain toys when they are subjected to a small source of ignition.
    The test methods described in Clause 5 are used for the purposes of determining the flammability of toys under the particular test conditions specified. The test results thus obtained cannot be considered as providing an overall indication of the potential fire hazard of toys or materials when subjected to other sources of ignition.
    This document includes general requirements relating to all toys and specific requirements and test methods relating to the following toys, which are considered as being those presenting the greatest hazard:
    —     toys intended to be worn on the head, such as beards, moustaches and wigs made from pile or flowing elements, masks, hoods and headdresses; however, paper and paperboard hats without embellishments or attachments are excluded;
    —     toy disguise costumes and toys intended to be worn by a child in play;
    —     toys intended to be entered by a child and constructed from textiles and/or polymer sheets and films;
    —     soft-filled toys (see A.6).
