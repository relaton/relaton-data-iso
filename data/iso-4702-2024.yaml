  content: "This document specifies a method to determine 93Zr by inductively coupled
    plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The mass concentrations obtained can be converted
    into activity concentrations. The method is applicable to test samples of drinking
    water, rainwater, surface and ground water, marine water, as well as cooling water,
    industrial water, domestic, and industrial wastewater after proper sampling and
    handling, and test sample preparation.\nThe limit of detection depends on the
    sample volume, the instrument used, the background count rate, the detection efficiency
    and the chemical yield. In this document, the limit of detection of the method
    using currently available apparatus is approximately 0,09 Bq·l−1 (or Bq·kg−1),
    which is lower than the WHO criteria for safe consumption of drinking water (100 Bq·l−1)[4].\nThe
    method described in this document covers the measurement of 93Zr in water at activity
    concentrations between 0,09 Bq·l−1 and 100 Bq·l−1. Samples with higher activity
    concentrations than 100 Bq·l−1 can be measured if a dilution is performed. \nThe
    method described in this document is applicable in the event of an emergency.\nFiltration
    of the test sample is necessary for the method described in this document. The
    analysis of 93Zr adsorbed to suspended matter is not covered by this method. The
    analysis of the insoluble fraction requires a mineralization step that is not
    covered by this document. In this case, the measurement is made on the different
    phases obtained.\nIt is the user’s responsibility to ensure the validity of this
    test method for the water samples tested."
