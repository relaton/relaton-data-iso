    ISO/IEC 23004-1:2007 specifies the architecture of the MPEG Multimedia Middleware technology. Multimedia Middleware (M3W) allows application software to execute multimedia functions with a minimum knowledge of the inner workings of the multimedia middleware as well as to support a structured way of updating, upgrading and/or extending the multimedia middleware. The architecture consists of the following.
    - M3W API:

    multimedia API (specified in detail in ISO/IEC 23004-2);
    interfaces for audio broadcast decoding, processing and rendering;
    interfaces for video broadcast decoding, processing and rendering;
    IPMP interfaces;
    governance interfaces.


    - Support API (specified in detail in ISO/IEC 23004-3 to ISO/IEC 23004-7):

    interfaces for instantiation of services (Runtime Environment and Service Manager);
    interfaces for interaction with remote services (REMI-P and REMI-R, REMI stands for Remote Method Invocator);
    interfaces for Resource Management;
    interfaces for Component Download;
    interfaces for Fault Management;
    interfaces for Integrity Management.


    - Realization technology (specified in detail in ISO/IEC 23004-3):

    Unit of Trading;
    Unit of Loading;
    Unit of Instantiation;
    standard interfaces:

    navigation between interfaces,
    binding,
    access to public attributes.
