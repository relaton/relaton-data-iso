    The test method in this document is intended to be used to characterize and compare the degradation of a set of print materials under exposure to particular light sources, eventually including optical filter combinations, under museum environmental conditions. The document covers typical types of indoor light sources commonly found in a museum including indoor daylight, LED, and incandescent light.
    This document is applicable to analogue and digital reflection photographic prints.
    NOTE      Examples of photographic prints covered by this document are prints made with digital printing technologies such as inkjet, electrophotography, and thermal dye transfer, as well as prints made on silver halide colour paper but not prints made on black and white silver halide paper.
