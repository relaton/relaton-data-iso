  content: "ISO/TS 10303-1156:2005 specifies the application module for Product structure
    and classification. \nThe following are within the scope of ISO/TS 10303-1156:2005:
    \n- the existence of an individual product;\n- a whole-part relationship between
    two individual products;\n- a connection relationship between two individual products;\n-
    a containment relationship between two individual products;\n- an involvement
    of a individual product in a connection between individual products; \n- the existence
    of a class of product;\n- a mapping between one class of product and another that
    indicates the nature of a whole-part relationship between two individual products;
    \n- a mapping between one class of product and another that indicates the nature
    of a connection relationship between two individual products; \n- a mapping between
    one class of product and another that indicates the nature of a containment relationship
    between two individual products; \n- a mapping between a class of product and
    a class of connection of product that indicates the nature of an involvement of
    an individual product in a connection; \n- set theory relationships, such as subset,
    union and intersection, between classes of product and between mappings; \n- the
    classification of an individual product as a member of a class of product; \n-
    the classification of a relationship between individual products as a member of
    a mapping; \n- the specification of the complete membership of a class of product
    or of a mapping between classes of product; \n- reference to an externally defined
    class of product or product relationship."
