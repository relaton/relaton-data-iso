abstract:
- content: "ISO 16049-1:2013 specifies the design criteria and testing methods adequate
    to guarantee the ultimate load and operational dependability of cargo restraint
    strap assemblies with a typical rated ultimate tension load capability of 22 250
    N (5 000 lbf), as used by the airline industry in order to restrain on board civil
    transport aircraft during flight:\na)         cargo loaded and tied down onto
    airworthiness approved air cargo pallets, themselves restrained into aircraft
    lower deck, main deck or upper deck cargo systems and meeting the requirements
    of ISO 8097 (NAS 3610) or ISO 21100, or \nb)         non-unitized individual pieces
    of cargo, or pieces of cargo placed onto an unrestrained (\"floating\") pallet
    into either lower deck, main deck or upper deck containerized cargo compartments
    of an aircraft.\nThe same restraint strap assemblies can also be used in other
    applications such as:\nc)         non-containerized (bulk loaded) baggage and
    cargo compartments,\nd)         to ensure cargo restraint inside an airworthiness
    approved air cargo container.\nCompliance with ISO 16049-1:2013 provides one means
    of cargo restraint straps airworthiness approval by Civil Aviation Authorities
    under TSO/ETSO C-172, in addition to the other requirements therein."
