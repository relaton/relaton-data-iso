  content: "ISO/IEC 19770-1:2006 has been developed to enable an organization to prove
    that it is performing software asset management (SAM) to a standard sufficient
    to satisfy corporate governance requirements and ensure effective support for
    IT service management overall. ISO/IEC 19770-1:2006 is intended to align closely
    to, and to support, ISO/IEC 20000. Good practice in SAM should result in several
    benefits, and certifiable good practice should allow management and other organizations
    to place reliance on the adequacy of these processes. The expected benefits should
    be achieved with a high degree of confidence: \nSAM should facilitate the management
    of business risks, cost control and give competitive advantages."
