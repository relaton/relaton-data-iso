    This document specifies rules for a certification scheme for continuous production of steel bars, rods and wires for the reinforcement of concrete structures in order to verify conformity with requirements specified in product standards, such as ISO 6935‑1 and ISO 6935‑2.
    It includes requirements for the production process and management system assessment activities.
    A product certification scheme for continuous production consists of the following stages:
    —          initial evaluation;
    —          review of evidence of conformity;
    —          certification decision and attestation;
    —          surveillance activities.
