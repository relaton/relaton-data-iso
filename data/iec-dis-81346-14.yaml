abstract:
- content: "This part of 81346 International Standard, published jointly by IEC and
    ISO, provides, in combination \nwith IEC 81346-1 and IEC 81346-2, rules and recommendations
    on the structuring of systems and \nthe information on systems in area of technical
    products and equipment of manufacturing systems. \nIt also provides classification
    scheme of infrastructure objects in such system for use in function -\nproduct-
    location- and type-specific reference designations of technical products and their
    \ndocumentation for manufacturing systems.\nThe structuring principles and the
    classes of infrastructure objects are intended to provide a clear \nidentification
    and localization of the technical products, and for use in their labelling in
    the \nmanufacturing plant, for their designation in technical documents and for
    the designation of the \ntechnical documents as well.\nThis document encompasses
    the process of transforming, processing and maintaining material. The \nspecifications
    in this document apply for processing, transportation and storage of final products,
    \nas well as for auxiliary systems to support the manufacturing process such as
    electrical systems, \nmanagement systems and waste disposal systems.This document
    is not applicable for designations related to product individuals (e.g. inventory
    \nnumber, serial number) or the designation of object types and classes of products
    (e.g. article \nnumber or parts number)."
