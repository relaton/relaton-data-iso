    This document specifies a point counting method for statistically estimating the volume fraction of a constituent through the microstructure of a steel by means of a point grid.
    It applies to constituents which are clearly identifiable.
    By default, counting is performed manually, but can be computer assisted or substituted by validated computer algorithms.
    NOTE            In this document, the word "constituent" can designate a phase as well as a micrographic constituent composed of two or more phases.
