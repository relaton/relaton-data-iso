    Abstract:
    This standard is part of the POSIX ® series of standards for applications and user inter-faces to
    open systems. It defines the Ada language bindings as package specifications and accompanying textual
    descriptions of the application program interface (API). This standard supports application portability at the
    source code level through the binding between ISO 8652:1995 (Ada) and ISO/IEC 9945-1:1996 (IEEE Std
    1003.1-1996) (POSIX) as amended by IEEE P1003.1g/D6.6. Terminology and general requirements, process
    primitives, the process environment, files and directories, input and output primaries, device- and classspecific
    functions, language-specific services for Ada, system databases, synchronization, memory
    management, execution scheduling, clocks and timers, message passing, task management, the XTI and
    socket detailed network inter-faces, event management, network support functions, and protocol-specific
    mappings are covered. It also specifies behavior to support the binding that must be provided by the Ada.
