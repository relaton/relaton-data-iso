    This part of ISO 22846 provides recommendations and guidance on the use of rope access methods for
    work at height and expands on the fundamental principles given in ISO 22846-1, in conjunction with which it
    is intended to be used. It is intended for use by employers, employees and self-employed persons who use
    rope access methods, by those commissioning rope access work and by rope access associations. This part
    of ISO 22846 is applicable to the use of rope access methods in any situation where ropes are used as the
    primary means of access, egress or support and as the primary means of protection against a fall, on both
    man-made and natural features.
    This part of ISO 22846 is not intended to apply to the use of rope access methods for leisure activities,
    arboriculture, general steeplejack methods, emergency personal evacuation or to the use of rope rescue (line
    rescue) techniques by emergency services for rescue work or for rescue training. Nevertheless, individuals
    engaged in these and similar activities can benefit from the advice given in this part of ISO 22846.
