abstract:
- content: ISO 4106:2004 specifies methods for evaluating the performance of engines
    designed for motorcycles as defined in ISO 3833, in particular with a view to
    the presentation of power curves and specific fuel consumption at full load as
    a function of engine speed, for net power assessment. Used in conjunction with
    ISO 15550, it is applicable to reciprocating internal combustion engines (spark-ignition
    or compression-ignition) -- excluding free-piston engines -- and rotary piston
    engines, either naturally aspirated or pressure-charged and equipped with either
    mechanical pressure-charger or turbocharger.
