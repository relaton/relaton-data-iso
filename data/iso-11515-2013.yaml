    ISO 11515:2013 specifies minimum requirements for the design, construction and performance testing of composite reinforced tubes between 450 l and 3 000 l water capacity, for transport,  storage and use of compressed or liquefied gases with test pressures up to and including 1600 bar with a design life of at least 15 years and less than or equal to 30 years. The expected service temperatures are between -40 °C and +65 °C.
    The tubes defined are one of three types:
    Type 2 - a hoop wrapped tube with a load sharing metal liner and composite reinforcement on the cylindrical portion only.
    Type 3 - a fully wrapped tube with a load sharing metal liner and composite reinforcement on both the cylindrical portion and the dome ends.
    Type 4 - a fully wrapped tube with a non-load sharing liner and composite reinforcement on both the cylindrical portion and the dome ends.
    The Type 4 tubes are not intended to contain toxic, oxidizing or corrosive gases.
    ISO 11515:2013 is limited to tubes with composite reinforcement of carbon fibre or aramid fibre or glass fibre (or a mixture thereof) in a matrix.
    Composite tubes can be used alone or in batteries to equip trailers or skids (ISO modules) or multiple element gas containers (MEGC) for the transportation and distribution of gases.
    ISO 11515:2013 does not include consideration of any additional stresses that can occur during service or transport, (e.g. torsional / bending stresses). However it is important that the stresses associated with mounting the tube are considered by the assembly manufacturer and the tube manufacturer.
    The design life of tubes according to ISO 11515:2013 for transport of dangerous goods can be limited by the applicable regulations.
