    This document specifies requirements for steel sheet hot-rolled of structural quality with improved atmospheric corrosion resistance, also known as weather-resistant structural steel. It is produced in the grades and classes listed in Table 1. The product is intended for applications where requirements are for mechanical properties and increased resistance to atmospheric corrosion. It is generally used in the delivered condition and is intended for bolted, riveted or welded structures.
    This document does not apply to the following steel qualities:
    —          steels intended for boilers and pressure vessels, and steels designated as commercial quality and drawing qualities (see ISO 3573);
    —          steels produced on reversing mills and designated with improved atmospheric corrosion resistance (see ISO 630-5);
    —          steels designated with structural quality (see ISO 4995), and high yield strength structural quality (see ISO 4996);
    —          steels designated with higher yield strength with improved formability (see ISO 5951).
