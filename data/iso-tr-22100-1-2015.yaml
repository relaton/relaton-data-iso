    ISO/TR 22100-1:2015 provides assistance to the designer/manufacturer of machinery and related components as to how the system of existing type-A, type-B and type-C machinery safety standards should be applied in order to design a machine to achieve a level of tolerable risk by adequate risk reduction.
    It explains the general principles of ISO 12100 and how this type-A standard should be used for practical cases in conjunction with type-B and type-C machinery safety standards.
    ISO/TR 22100-1:2015 provides assistance to standards writing committees on how ISO 12100 and type-B and type-C standards relate and explains their function in the risk assessment and risk reduction process according to ISO 12100.
    It includes an overview of existing categories of type-B standards to assist standards readers and writers to navigate the many standards.
