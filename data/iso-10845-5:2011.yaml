  script: Latn
  content: |-
    ISO 10845-5:2011 establishes a key performance indicator, in the form of a contract participation goal (CPG), relating to the engagement of targeted enterprises on a contract for the provision of goods, services or engineering and construction works. A CPG may be used to measure the outcomes of a contract in relation to the engagement of targeted enterprises or to establish a target level of performance for the contractor to achieve or exceed in the performance of a contract.
    ISO 10845-5:2011 sets out the methods by which the key performance indicator is measured, quantified and verified in the performance of the contract in respect to two different targeting strategies: targeting strategy A and targeting strategy B.
