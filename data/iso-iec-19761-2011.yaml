    ISO/IEC 19761:2011 specifies the set of definitions, conventions and activities of the COSMIC Functional Size Measurement Method. It is applicable to software from the following functional domains:
    ISO/IEC 19761:2011 has not been designed for measuring the functional size of a piece of software, or its parts, which
    - is characterized by complex mathematical algorithms or other specialized and complex rules, such as can be found in expert systems, simulation software, self-learning software and weather forecasting systems, or
    - processes continuous variables such as audio sounds or video images, such as can be found in computer game software, musical instruments and the like.
