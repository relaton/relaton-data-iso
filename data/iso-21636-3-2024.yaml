  content: "The ISO 21636 series provides a framework for the identification and description
    of varieties of all individual human languages (see ISO 639). \nIt is applicable
    to sign languages. \nIt does not apply to:\n—     artificial means of communication
    with or between machines (such as programming languages); \n—     those means
    of human communication which are neither fully nor largely equivalent to human
    language (such as sets of individual symbols or gestures that each carry isolated
    meanings but cannot be freely combined into complex expressions).\nThis document
    gives guidance on how to apply the framework to identify basic dimensions and
    sub-dimensions of linguistic variation and the resulting varieties, including
    major modalities of human communication. It does not include any code or individual
    identifiers.\nThis document is structured strictly analogously to ISO/TR 21636-2.
    For a general description of the dimension and varieties dealt with in each clause,
    the user can refer to the corresponding clause in that document.\nThis document
    focuses only on the identification and description of language varieties, not
    on the general, formal or technical aspects of the description of human language
    resources (LRs), which are covered by general metadata frameworks.\nNOTE 1       
    For the general description of a language resource, a user can minimally apply
    at least the metadata of the Open Language Archives Community (OLAC) metadata
    standard, which provides an application of the Dublin Core metadata element set
    as defined by the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI). These descriptors have
    been recognized in ISO 15836-1:2017.\nNOTE 2        The Component Metadata Infrastructure
    (CMDI) provides a best practice guide for the sake of technical and content interoperability
    between LRs as well as of their sustainability."
