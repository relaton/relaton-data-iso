abstract:
- content: The method consists in decomposition of the soap by a known volume of standard
    volumetric mineral acid solution, extraction and separation of the liberated fatty
    matter with light petroleum and determination of a total alkali content by titration
    of the excess of acid contained in the aqueous phase with a standard volumetric
    sodium hydroxide solution. After evaporation of the light petroleum from the extract,
    dissolution of the residue in ethanol and neutralization of the fatty acids with
    a standard volumetric potassium hydroxide solution. Evaporation of the ethanol
    and weighing of the soap formed to determine the total fatty matter content.
