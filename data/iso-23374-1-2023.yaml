    Automated valet parking systems (AVPSs) perform level 4 automated driving of individual or multiple unoccupied vehicles within a prescribed area of a parking facility. This document specifies performance requirements for the operation functions, the environmental conditions within parking facilities where automated vehicle operation is performed, and the test procedures to verify the performance requirements.
    An AVPS is comprised of physically separated sub-systems distributed among vehicles, facility equipment and user domains. The functionalities of AVPSs are realized by cooperation of these sub-systems, which are, in many cases, provided by different organizations. This document defines the system architecture and the communication interfaces between the sub-systems at the logical level.
    An AVPS manages its system participants (i.e. AVPS-compliant vehicles and parking facilities) and provides interfaces to other facility users and involved persons (e.g. system operators, facility managers). This document contains requirements for the management functions such as checking compatibility between vehicles and parking facilities, performing remote assistance and recovery when automated driving cannot be performed, and executing operation stop commands in response to the actions of other facility users.
    AVPSs are intended for use by a service provider upon receiving authority over vehicles from individual service recipients. This document does not include parking automation technologies that are solely based on usage by an individual user. If the vehicle is put into driverless operation directly by the user, this is not considered to be part of the AVPS.
