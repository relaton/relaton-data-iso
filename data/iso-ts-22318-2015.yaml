    ISO/TS 22318:2015 gives guidance on methods for understanding and extending the principles of BCM embodied in ISO 22301 and ISO 22313 to the management of supplier relationships. This Technical Specification is generic and applicable to all organizations (or parts thereof), regardless of type, size and nature of business. It is applicable to the supply of products and services, both internally and externally. The extent of application of this Technical Specification depends on the organization's operating environment and complexity.
    Supply chain management considers the full range of activities concerned with the provision of supplies or services to an organization as a part of business-as-usual. The scope of this Technical Specification is less broad in that it specifically considers the issues faced by an organization which needs continuity of supply of products and services to protect its business activities or processes, and the continuity strategies for current suppliers within supply chains, which can be used to mitigate the impact of disruption; this is SCCM.
    Guidance on developing a business continuity plan or business continuity management system is set out in ISO 22301 and ISO 22313.
