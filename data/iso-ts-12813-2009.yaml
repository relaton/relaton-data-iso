abstract:
- content: "ISO/TS 12813:2009 defines requirements for short-range communication for
    the purposes of compliance checking in autonomous electronic fee-collecting (EFC)
    systems. Compliance checking communication (CCC) takes place between a road vehicle's
    on-board equipment (OBE) and an outside interrogator (road-side mounted equipment,
    mobile device or hand‑held unit), and serves to establish whether the data that
    are delivered by the OBE correctly reflect the road usage of the corresponding
    vehicle according to the rules of the pertinent toll regime.\nThe operator of
    the compliance checking interrogator is assumed to be part of the toll charging
    role as defined in ISO 17573. The CCC permits identification of the OBE, vehicle
    and contract, and verification of whether the driver has fulfilled his obligations
    and the checking status and performance of the OBE. The CCC reads, but does not
    write, OBE data. \nISO/TS 12813:2009 is applicable to OBE in an autonomous mode
    of operation; it is not applicable to compliance checking in dedicated short-range
    communication (DSRC)-based charging systems. It defines data syntax and semantics,
    but does not define a communication sequence. All the attributes defined herein
    are required in any OBE claimed to be compliant with ISO/TS 12813:2009, even if
    some values are set to “not defined” in cases where a certain functionality is
    not present in an OBE. The interrogator is free to choose which attributes are
    read, as well as the sequence in which they are read. In order to achieve compatibility
    with existing systems, the communication makes use of the attributes defined in
    ISO 14906 wherever possible. \nThe CCC is suitable for a range of short‑range
    communication media. Specific definitions are given for the CEN DSRC specified
    in EN 15509, as well as for the use of ISO CALM IR, UNI DSRC and ARIB DSRC as
    alternatives to the CEN DSRC. The attributes and functions defined are for compliance
    checking by means of the DSRC communication services provided by DSRC layer 7,
    with the CCC attributes and functions made available to the CCC applications at
    the road-side equipment (RSE) and OBE. The attributes and functions are defined
    on the level of ADU (application data units). \nTest specifications are not within
    the scope of ISO/TS 12813:2009. "
