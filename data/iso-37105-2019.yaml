    This document specifies a descriptive framework for a city including an associated foundational ontology of the anatomical structure of a city or community. The descriptive framework is intended to have the following qualities:
    —     timeless, i.e. compatible with any human settlement at any time in history;
    —     acultural, i.e. valid for any culture and any type of city;
    —     scalable, i.e. valid for a metropolis, a city, a small town or a village;
    —     generic, so that everything we could define as a "human settlement", such as a "smart city", has a place in this structure.
