  content: "ISO 14461-2|IDF 169-2:2005 describes a routine procedure for the evaluation
    of results of the enumeration of microorganisms using colony-count methods with
    subsequent 10-fold dilution steps and one plate or two parallel plates within
    each dilution step. \nThis routine procedure is applied regularly in each laboratory
    performing colony counts. It provides criteria for the acceptability of differences
    between the results from parallel plates and subsequent dilution steps, as follows.\nThe
    results (colony counts) obtained from parallel plates are compared with tabulated
    limits for given colony counts. If these limits are exceeded, a technical problem
    when performing the parallel determinations may be indicated.\nThe results (sums
    of colony counts) of two parallel plates of two subsequent 10-fold dilution steps
    are compared with tabulated limits for given sums of colony counts. If these limits
    are exceeded, a technical problem when performing the dilutions may be indicated.\nIf
    the limits mentioned above are exceeded in more cases than expected, this indicates
    that the test procedure lacks reliability."
