    ISO/TS 14798:2006 establishes general principles and specific procedures for assessing risk.
    The purpose of ISO/TS 14798:2006 is to provide a process for making decisions relevant to the safety of lifts during the
    -  design, construction, and installation of lifts, lift components, and systems;
    -  developing generic procedures for the use, operation, testing, compliance verification, and servicing of lifts; and
    -  development of technical specifications and standards affecting the safety of lifts.
    While examples in ISO/TS 14798:2006 refer primarily to risks of harm to persons, the risk assessment procedure set out can be equally effective for assessing other types of risks relevant to lifts, such as the risk of damage to property and environment.
