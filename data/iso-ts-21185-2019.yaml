    This document specifies a methodology to define ITS-S communication profiles (ITS-SCPs) based on standardized communication protocols to interconnect trusted devices. These profiles enable secure information exchange between such trusted devices, including secure low-latency information exchange, in different configurations. The present document also normatively specifies some ITS-SCPs based on the methodology, yet without the intent of covering all possible cases, in order to exemplify the methodology.
    Configurations of trusted devices for which this document defines ITS-SCPs include:
    a)    ITS station communication units (ITS-SCU) of the same ITS station unit (ITS-SU), i.e. station-internal communications;
    b)    an ITS-SU and an external entity such as a sensor and control network (SCN), or a service in the Internet;
    c)    ITS-SUs.
    Other ITS-SCPs can be specified at a later stage.
    The specifications given in this document can also be applied to unsecured communications and can be applied to groupcast communications as well.
