    ISO 12649:2004 provides safety specifications for the design and construction of binding and finishing equipment operated in a system configuration or in stand-alone mode. It provides safety requirements for the design and construction of equipment used to convert printed or blank substrates into cut, folded, collated, assembled, bound, or otherwise finished product. It may also be applied to processes for preparing substrate for the printing process.
    It addresses recognized hazards specific to binding and finishing equipment and systems, such as mechanical, electrical, slipping, tripping, falling, ergonomics, noise, radiation, fire and explosion, thermal and emissions hazards.
