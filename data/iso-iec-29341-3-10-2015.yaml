    This service definition is compliant with the UPnP Device Architecture version 1.0.
    This service type enables control over the transport of audio and video streams.  The service type defines a ?common' model for A/V transport control suitable for a generic user interface. It can be used to control a wide variety of disc, tape and solid-state based media devices such as CD players, VCRs and MP3 players. A minimal implementation of this service can be used to control tuners.
    The service type is related to the ConnectionManager service type, which describes A/V connection setup procedures, and the ContentDirectory service, which offers meta-information about the resource stored on the media. AVTransport also offers an action to retrieve any meta data embedded in the resource itself.
    This service type does not offer scheduled recording.
