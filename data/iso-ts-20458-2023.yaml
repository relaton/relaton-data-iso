    This document provides definitions, symbols, mechanical requirements, certification test procedure, electronic subsystem requirements and user’s manual for advanced pedestrian legform impactor (aPLI), a standardized pedestrian legform impactor with an upper mass for pedestrian subsystem testing of road vehicles. It is applicable to impact tests involving:
    —     vehicles of category M1, except vehicles with the maximum mass above 2 500 kg and which are derived from N1 category vehicles and where the driver’s position, R-point, is either forward of the front axle or longitudinally rearwards of the front axle transverse centreline by a maximum of 1 100 mm;
    —     vehicles of category N1, except where the driver’s position, R-point, is either forward of the front axle or longitudinally rearwards of the front axle transverse centreline by a maximum of 1 100 mm;
    —     impacts to the bumper test area as defined by UN R127[1] and UN GTR No.9[2];
    —     pedestrian subsystem tests involving use of a legform for the purpose of evaluating compliance with vehicle safety standards.
