    ISO 9564-1:2017 specifies the basic principles and techniques which provide the minimum security measures required for effective international PIN management. These measures are applicable to those institutions responsible for implementing techniques for the management and protection of PINs during their creation, issuance, usage and deactivation.
    ISO 9564-1:2017 is applicable to the management of cardholder PINs for use as a means of cardholder verification in retail banking systems in, notably, automated teller machine (ATM) systems, point-of-sale (POS) terminals, automated fuel dispensers, vending machines, banking kiosks and PIN selection/change systems. It is applicable to issuer and interchange environments.
    The provisions of ISO 9564-1:2017 are not intended to cover:
    a)   PIN management and security in environments where no persistent cryptographic relationship exists between the transaction-origination device and the acquirer, e.g. use of a browser for online shopping (for these environments, see ISO 9564-4);
    b)   protection of the PIN against loss or intentional misuse by the customer;
    c)   privacy of non-PIN transaction data;
    d)   protection of transaction messages against alteration or substitution;
    e)   protection against replay of the PIN or transaction;
    f)    specific key management techniques;
    g)   offline PIN verification used in contactless devices;
    h)   requirements specifically associated with PIN management as it relates to multi-application functionality in an ICC.
