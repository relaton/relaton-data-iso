    ISO 12991:2012 specifies the construction requirements for refillable fuel tanks for liquefied natural gas (LNG) used in vehicles as well as the testing methods required to ensure that a reasonable level of protection from loss of life and property resulting from fire and explosion is provided.
    It is applicable to fuel tanks intended to be permanently attached to land vehicles but can be used as a guide for other modes of transport.
