    ISO 22493:2014 defines terms used in the practice of scanning electron microscopy (SEM). It covers both general and specific concepts, classified according to their hierarchy in a systematic order, with those terms that have already been defined in ISO 23833 also included, where appropriate.
    ISO 22493:2014is applicable to all standardization documents relevant to the practice of SEM. In addition, some clauses of ISO 22493:2014 are applicable to documents relevant to related fields (e.g. EPMA, AEM, EDS) for the definition of terms which are relevant to such fields.
