    This Recommendation | International Standard defines a set of lossless (bit-preserving) and lossy compression methods for coding bi-level, continuous-tone grey-scale, palletized colour, or continuous-tone colour digital still images.
    This Recommendation | International Standard:
    ? specifies decoding processes for converting compressed image data to reconstructed image data;
    ? specifies a codestream syntax containing information for interpreting the compressed image data;
    ? specifies a file format;
    ? provides guidance on encoding processes for converting source image data to compressed image data;
    ? provides guidance on how to implement these processes in practice.
    NOTE ? As this specification was first published as common text only after ISO/IEC JTC1 had approved the first edition in 2000, edition numbers in the ITU and ISO/IEC versions are offset by one. This is the third edition of ITU-T T.800 and the fourth edition of ISO/IEC 15444-1.
