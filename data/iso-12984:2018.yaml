    ISO 12984:2018 specifies a method for the determination of the particle size distribution of a sample of coke having a typical size distribution as normally produced by calcination of delayed petroleum coke. The same procedure is applicable to consignments of calcined anthracite. This document does not apply to fractions of carbon material prepared by sieving and crushing or to filter fines.
    This method is applicable to the determination of particle sizes ranging from 0,25 mm to 16 mm, as the sum of the percentages of the size distribution above and below this range is typically less than 10 %. This document does not apply to determining particle sizes below 0,25 mm where a specific test for dust is used.
