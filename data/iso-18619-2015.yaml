  content: ISO 18619:2015 specifies a procedure, including computation, by which a
    transform between ICC profiles can be adjusted (compensated) to take into account
    differences between the dark end of the source colour space and the dark end of
    the destination colour space. This is referred to as black point compensation
    (BPC). The relative colorimetric encoding of ICC profile transforms already provides
    a mechanism for such adjustment of the light (white) end of the tone scale.
