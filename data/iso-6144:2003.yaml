abstract:
- content: ISO 6144:2003 specifies a method for the preparation of calibration gas
    mixtures by a static volumetric method and provides a procedure for calculating
    the volumetric composition of the mixture. It can be used either with binary gas
    mixtures (containing one calibration component in a complementary gas, which is
    usually nitrogen or air) or with mixtures containing more than one component in
    the complementary gas. This International Standard also specifies how the expanded
    uncertainty in the volume fraction of each calibration component in the mixture
    is determined by a rigorous evaluation of all the measurement uncertainties involved,
    including those associated with the apparatus used for the preparation of the
    gas mixture and those associated with the experimental procedure itself.
