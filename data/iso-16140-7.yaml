abstract:
- content: "This document specifies the general principle and the technical protocol
    for the validation of identification methods of microorganisms for microbiology
    in the food chain. As there is no reference method, this document provides a protocol
    to evaluate the performance characteristics and validate the method workflow using
    well-defined strains. When required, an additional identification method can be
    used.\nThis document is applicable to the validation of identification methods
    of microorganisms that are used for the analysis of microorganisms in:\n—\tproducts
    intended for human consumption;\n—\tproducts intended for animal feeding;\n—\tenvironmental
    samples in the area of food and feed production, handling;\n—\tsamples from the
    primary production stage.\nValidated identification methods cannot be used instead
    of confirmation described in:\n—\tthe reference method;\n—\tan alternative method
    validated in accordance with ISO 16140-2;\n—\tan alternative method validated
    in accordance with ISO 16140-6.\nIn these instances, the identification method
    shall be validated in accordance with the ISO 16140-6 to be used as a confirmation
    method. \nThis document is, in particular, applicable to bacteria and fungi. Some
    clauses can be applicable to other (micro)organisms, to be determined on a case-by-case
    basis."
