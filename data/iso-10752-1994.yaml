abstract:
- content: Describes the principles and methods for the expression of results of performance
    tests on sizing equipment used in coal preparation, and includes methods for the
    evaluation of performance parameters. Performance test procedures and size measurement
    techniques are recommended. Applies to all types of sizing equipment, categorized
    as screens, classifiers, and others. The procedure described applies to two-product
    separations. Performance assessment of multiproduct separations can be achieved
    by consideration of a series of two-product separation.
