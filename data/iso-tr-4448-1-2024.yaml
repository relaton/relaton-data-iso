    This document provides an overview of the ground-based automated mobility systems deployment paradigm. The paradigm covers such kerbsides and pathways as are suitable for co-temporal, collaborative use by various types and combinations of automated and non-automated, wheeled, or ambulatory, motorized and non-motorized, mobility-related vehicles and devices as well as for various levels of automated or remote operation of such vehicles. This includes vehicles and devices that move people as well as goods within proximate distances of human bystanders.
    Note             Aerial (flying) drones are not part of the scope.
