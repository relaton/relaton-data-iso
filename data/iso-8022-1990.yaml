  content: A cotton disc of known nature and characteristics, held in a grip, is immersed
    in a solution of surface active agent of known concentration. After displacement
    of air an penetration of the solution into the cloth, the cotton disc starts to
    sink. The wetting time is determined by measurement the interval between the moment
    of immersion of the cotton disc and the moment when it begins to sink. The wetting
    time is determined of two standard solutions and for each of five different concentrations
    and then of the surface active agent solution under test for five different concentrations.
    The three curves "wetting time / concentration" are plotted and compared.
