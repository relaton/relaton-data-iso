    This document specifies fuse-links with bolt-in contacts (Type H and J) and test fixtures for the fuse-links for use in road vehicles. It establishes, for these fuse-link types, the rated current, test procedures, performance requirements and dimensions.
    This document is applicable to fuse-links with a rated voltage of 450 V DC, a current rating of ≤400 A and a breaking capacity of 2 000 A intended for use in road vehicles.
    This document is intended to be used in conjunction with ISO 8820-1 and with ISO 8820-2. The numbering of its clauses corresponds to that of ISO 8820-1 whose requirements are applicable, except where modified by requirements particular to this document.
