  content: "The objective of ISO/IEC 15944-2:2006 is the identification, registration,
    referencing and reusability of common objects in a business transaction. As stated
    in ISO/IEC 15944-1, reusability of scenarios and scenario components is an achievable
    objective because existing (global) business transactions, whether conducted on
    a for-profit or not for profit basis, already consist of reusable components unambiguously
    understood among participating parties. However, such existing \"standard\" components
    have not yet been formally specified and registered. The purpose of ISO/IEC 15944-2:2006
    is to fill this gap.\nISO/IEC 15944-2:2006 specifies procedures to be followed
    in preparing and maintaining registers of scenarios and scenario components. Although
    any organization may choose to establish registers of such items that conform
    to ISO/IEC 15944-2:2006, ISO/IEC 15944-2:2006 is intended particularly to apply
    to registers established under the auspices of ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 32. \nISO/IEC
    15944-2:2006 specifies the procedure by which Open-edi scenarios and scenario
    components can be registered as \"business objects\", starting with requirements
    for reusability and the ability to support cultural adaptability, as well as requirements
    of a jurisdictional nature as are applicable to the nature and goal of the business
    transaction. Registration principles are then stated, including\n- the federation
    of registration authorities;\n- internationally unique identification of Open-edi
    registry entries;\n- responsibilities of registration authorities;\n- registry
    operation;\n- registration status;\n- state of a register;\n- information required
    for registering scenarios and scenario components;\n- formal specification of
    scenarios and scenario components using an Open-edi Descriptive Technique.\nThe
    composite Open-edi registry item identifier, as well as roles and responsibilities
    in the management of Open-edi registers, are described. Registration authority
    and operations in the management of an Open-edi register are also described and
    a linkage to existing register standards is made by giving an overview of the
    ISO 19135:2005 register and its adaptation to the Open-edi register schema.\nNormative
    and informative annexes contain \n- consolidated list of terms and definitions;\n-
    Open-edi registration administration attributes;\n- reference to Open-edi scoping
    and specification attributes;\n- description of scenario classification concepts;\n-
    brief description of UML notation;\n- information on two classes of constraints,
    i.e. internal and external, as part of the business transaction model."
