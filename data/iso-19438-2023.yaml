abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: This document specifies a multi-pass filtration test, with continuous contaminant
    injection and using the on line particle counting method, to evaluate the performance
    of diesel fuel and petrol filters for internal combustion engines submitted to
    a constant flow rate of test liquid. The test procedure determines the contaminant
    capacity of a filter, its particulate removal characteristics and differential
    pressure. This document is applicable to filter elements having a rated flow between
    50 l/h and 800 l/h; however, by agreement between the filter manufacturer and
    customer, and with some modifications, the procedure is permitted for application
    to fuel filters with higher flow rates.
