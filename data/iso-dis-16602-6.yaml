    This document addresses the selection, use, care and maintenance (SUCAM) of chemical protective clothing (CPC). This guidance document is primarily intended for users, specifiers and others with responsibility for the procurement and provision of chemical protective clothing. It is also intended to be used by manufacturers in their dialogue with the users of PPE.
    This guidance document is intended to clarify the inter-relationship between this ISO 16602 series of standards and its modular approach, ISO 17723-1 but also how this links to the old classification of CPC.
    These guidelines are intended to assist users and specifiers in selecting the correct type of CPC for the task to be performed, and to help them ensure it is used according to the manufacturer's instructions to provide adequate chemical protection (including solids, airborne particles, aerosols, liquids, and gases (including radioactive contamination)) during its entire lifetime. Lifetime and effectiveness of protective clothing depend largely on care and maintenance. When cleaning, disinfection and end-of-life disposal are considered the environmental impact should also be taken into account.
    To assist the users of products covered under this document, this document provides descriptions of referenced test methods, guidelines for conducting hazard and risk assessments and suggested performance levels for certain applications. It is not the intent of this document to address all situations.
    NOTE Although this document has been created as a stand-alone document covering ISO 16602-1 through ISO 16602-5, it is strongly recommended to read this guidance in conjunction with ISO 16602-1 (if not the other parts) to understand the detail of the requirements.
