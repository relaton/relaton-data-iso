abstract:
- content: |-
    ISO/TS 14167:2003 provides guidance on the quality aspects in the field of gas analysis that are implemented in order to achieve a result with a valid measurement uncertainty.
    It provides guidelines on quality aspects to be employed in gas analysis using calibration gas mixtures and their subsequent validation and/or verification, and the testing of the analytical performance of gas analysis instruments. These guidelines have the overall objective of defining procedures which will ensure that measurements of gas composition are reliable, comparable and consistent between different organizations and countries.
    It explains, in particular, the concepts of measurement uncertainty and of traceability as effective quality assurance tools for defining the measurement uncertainty of particular measurement results. It also gives guidance on how to identify and estimate measurement uncertainty components of the result, and how to combine these uncertainty components in order to obtain the overall uncertainty.
