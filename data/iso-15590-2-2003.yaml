    ISO 15590-2:2003 specifies the technical delivery conditions for unalloyed or low-alloy steel seamless and welded pipeline fittings for use in pipeline transportation systems for the petroleum and natural gas industries as defined in ISO 13623.
    ISO 15590-2:2003 is applicable to welding end-fittings such as elbows, caps, tees, single or multiple extruded headers, reducers, and transition sections made from seamless and welded pipe of unalloyed or low-alloy steels.
    ISO 15590-2:2003 specifies three classes of fitting corresponding to increasing quality requirements in accordance with the technical delivery conditions of ISO 3183 for pipe.
    ISO 15590-2:2003 is not applicable to the selection of the fitting class.
    ISO 15590-2:2003 is not applicable to the materials for, or the attachment of, factory-welded extensions.
