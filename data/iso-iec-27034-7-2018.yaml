  content: "This document describes the minimum requirements when the required activities
    specified by an Application Security Control (ASC) are replaced with a Prediction
    Application Security Rationale (PASR). The ASC mapped to a PASR define the Expected
    Level of Trust for a subsequent application. In the context of an Expected Level
    of Trust, there is always an original application where the project team performed
    the activities of the indicated ASC to achieve an Actual Level of Trust.\nThe
    use of Prediction Application Security Rationales (PASRs), defined by this document,
    is applicable to project teams which have a defined Application Normative Framework
    (ANF) and an original application with an Actual Level of Trust. \nPredictions
    relative to aggregation of multiple components or the history of the developer
    in relation to other applications is outside the scope of this document."
