abstract:
- content: "This document specifies safety requirements and test methods for the components
    and systems that enable the transfer of compressed hydrogen to a hydrogen vehicle,
    as addressed in ISO 19880-1, by a hydrogen dispenser with dispensing pressures
    up to the H70 pressure class designation.\nThis document applies to a hydrogen
    dispensing system, referred to as a “dispenser”; the configuration of the dispenser
    can range from:\na) a dispenser cabinet, located in the fuelling area, that can
    perform all of the functionality needed to deliver hydrogen to a vehicle, to \nb)
    a minimum set of components mounted in or on (as applicable) a dispenser cabinet
    or other supporting structure as appropriate, with the remaining functionality
    provided elsewhere in the hydrogen fuelling station.\nA dispensing system includes
    the user and vehicle interface and can include components starting from the hydrogen
    supply, such as a connection to the banking system, a cooling unit, a dispenser
    control system, a flow meter, a pressure sensor, a fuel temperature sensor, an
    ambient temperature sensor, user interface and a fuelling hose assembly. Not all
    dispensing system equipment has to be physically housed within the enclosure at
    the dispensing area, as long as the specification of component design or type
    and location are adequate to ensure that the overall process meets the requirements
    in this document.\nThis document specifies the requirements for hydrogen dispensers
    and can provide specific references to other standards for individual components
    included in the hydrogen dispenser, such as valves (ISO 19880-3) and hoses (ISO 19880-5).\nThis
    document specifies general requirements for supporting the fuelling protocol and
    directs the user to ISO 19880-1 for additional requirements and the test methods
    required to verify proper fuelling protocol implementation.\nThis document does
    not specify the accuracy of flow meters that can be used to meter dispensed fuel."
