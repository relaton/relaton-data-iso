  content: Identifies specific test procedures for the acquisition and presentation
    of comparable data for certain basic properties of plastics. In general, each
    property is specified by a single experimental value although in certain cases
    properties are represented by two values obtained under different test conditions.
    The properties included are those presented conventionally in manufacturer's data
    sheets. Applies predominantly to those plastics that may be injection- or compression-moulded
    or prepared as sheets of specified thickness.
