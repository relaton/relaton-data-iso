  content: This document specifies a procedure to determine the shaft power of engine
    ships, by measuring the shaft distortion using an optical reflection type device.
    It gives the principles of the measurement, the components of the device and the
    calculation method. It also describes the factors for determining the measuring
    accuracy, including the calibration procedure, and specifies the on-board documentation
    for the device.
