    This document provides a general framework for improving the quality and comparability of methods for assessing the environmental, social and economic performance of construction works, and their combination as a basis for the sustainability assessment of buildings.
    It identifies and describes issues to be taken into account in the development and use of methods of assessment of the environmental, social and economic characteristics, aspects and impacts of new or existing buildings. These relate to the building’s design, production of construction products, materials and components, construction, operation, maintenance and refurbishment and end-of-life processes.
    This document is applicable to the assessment of the building (or part thereof) and the external works within its site (curtilage).
    NOTE      The assessment of environmental, social and economic aspects related to the location of the building, such as those resulting from transportation of the users, can extend beyond the area of the building site.
    This document does not set benchmarks or levels of performance relative to environmental, social and economic impacts and aspects.
