    This document provides guidance for a scenario-based safety evaluation framework for automated driving systems (ADSs). The framework elaborates a scenario-based safety evaluation process that is applied during product development. The guidance for the framework is intended to be applied to ADS defined in ISO/SAE PAS 22736 and to vehicle categories 1 and 2 according to Reference [10]. This scenario-based safety evaluation framework for ADS is applicable for limited access highways.
    This document does not address safety-related issues involving misuse, human machine interface and cybersecurity.
    This document does not address non-safety related issues involving comfort, energy efficiency or traffic flow efficiency.
