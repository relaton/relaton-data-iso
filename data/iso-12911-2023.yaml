    This document establishes a framework for providing specifications for the internal commissioning and implementation of building information modelling (BIM) during both delivery and operational phases. It identifies a structured approach so as to encourage clarity during development, management and checking processes for use by organizations that develop and apply these specifications.
    This document does not provide specific content but it does provide examples.
    It is applicable to buildings, infrastructure, facilities and managed landscapes, of any size or complexity.
