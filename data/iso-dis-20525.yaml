    This standard defines a semantics base that allows representing relevant information related to tourist destinations (tourist destination, tourist resources and services within the destination, travel experiences), ensuring -through its use- the interoperability of municipal, territorial and country tourist platforms with third-party developments.
    This standard provides the tourist activity with semantic data structures that benefit the whole value chain, from content developers to destinations managers and final users (i.e. tourists) facilitating the access to the relevant information in an intuitive and agile way.
