- content: |-
    This document describes the principles and methods for the expression of results of performance tests on sizing equipment used in coal preparation, and includes methods for the evaluation of performance parameters. Performance test procedures and size measurement techniques are recommended.
    This document applies to all types of sizing equipment, categorized as follows:
    — screens;
    — classifiers;
    — others.
    The procedure described in this document applies to two-product separations. Performance assessment of multiproduct separations can be achieved by consideration of a series of two-product separations.
