    ISO 9943:2009 specifies the design requirements and general considerations for the ventilation and air-treatment of galleys and pantries with cooking appliances on board merchant seagoing ships, when such ventilation and air-treatment is specified by the shipowner.
    It applies for normal conditions in all waters except those encountered in extremely cold or hot climates.
    For the purposes of ISO 9943:2009, pantries with cooking appliances, referred to above, are those which contain appliances consuming more than the small amount of electrical power needed for coffee urns, hot-plates for keeping food warm, electric water boilers, etc.
    Users of ISO 9943:2009 should note that, while observing its requirements, they should at the same time ensure compliance with such statutory requirements, rules and regulations as may be applicable to the individual ship concerned.
