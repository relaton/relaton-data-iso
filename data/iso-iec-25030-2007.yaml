  content: "ISO/IEC 25030:2007 provides requirements and recommendations for the specification
    of software quality requirements. It applies to both acquirers and suppliers.
    It focuses on software quality requirements, but takes a system perspective since
    software is normally developed and applied as part of a larger system.\nSoftware
    product quality requirements are needed for:\n- specification (including contractual
    agreement and call for tender);\n- planning (including feasibility analysis);\n-
    development (including early identification of potential quality problems during
    development); and\n- evaluation (including objective assessment and certification
    of software product quality).\nIf software quality requirements are not stated
    clearly, they may be viewed, interpreted, implemented and evaluated differently
    by different people. This may result in: software which is inconsistent with user
    expectations and of poor quality; users, clients and developers who are unsatisfied;
    and time and cost overruns to rework software.\nISO/IEC 25030:2007 helps to improve
    the quality of software quality requirements. It does this by providing requirements
    and recommendations for quality requirements, and guidance for the processes used
    to define and analyse quality requirements. It applies the quality model defined
    in ISO/IEC 9126-1 [ISO/IEC 25010] and it complies with the requirement processes
    defined in ISO/IEC 15288. \nISO/IEC 25030 is part of the SQuaRE series of International
    Standards."
