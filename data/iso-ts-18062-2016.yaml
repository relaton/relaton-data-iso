abstract:
- content: "ISO/TS 18062:2016 aims to\na)    specify the minimal characterizing generic
    concepts in herbal medicament (3.2) within terminological systems (3.8), that
    are required for terms used to identify of herbal medicines regulated by medicine
    regulatory agencies (3.10), and\nb)    facilitate the consistency and interoperability
    of the terms and their designating concepts in terminological systems.\nIn order
    to achieve these goals, this document specifies the minimal compositional concept
    representation of herbal medicament for use in terminological systems (3.8), while
    expressing semantic links and characterizing categories for formal definitions,
    with a set of domain constraints in the subject field[6] [7].\nHerbal medicaments
    (3.2) can be classified into \n1)    single herbal medicament (SHM), and\n2)    herbal
    medicament composed of several kinds of SHM.\nNOTE          Single herbal medicament
    is composed of only one herbal medicament. Herbal medicament composed of several
    kinds of SHMs is conventionally called \"formula.\" This document is not intended
    to include the mixture of formulae.\nThe specific intended use of this compositional
    concept representation is to\n-      provide a well-structured backbone for terminological
    systems,\n-      clarify the synonymy, homonymy and polysemy across different
    clinical specialties and terminological resources,\n-      promote meaningful
    exchange of information among different terminological systems,\n-      promote
    consistency and interoperability or re-use of terms among different terminological
    systems,\n-      facilitate the representation of herbal medicines in a manner
    suitable for computer processing,\n-      support developers and maintainers of
    terminological resources (3.7) to facilitate conformance,\n-      support knowledge
    management on herbal medicines with facilitating analysis of concerned data, and\n-
    \     support the reduction of confusion in trade and of health hazard in consequence.\nThe
    following topics are out of scope for this document:\n-      any implementation
    models or database schemas, and manufacturing models;\n-      any models or frameworks
    for quality control, and models for chemical and physical characteristics;\n-
    \     any individual pharmaceutical or medicinal products, and combinations use
    with modern medicines."
