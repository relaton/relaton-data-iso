    ISO 8513:2014 specifies three test methods for determining the longitudinal tensile properties of glass-reinforced thermosetting plastics (GRP) pipes. The properties which can be determined are: the longitudinal tensile strength and the percentage ultimate elongation.
    Method A uses, for the test piece(s), a longitudinal strip cut from a pipe.
    Method B uses a specified length of the full cross-section of the pipe.
    Method C uses a notched plate cut from a pipe wall section.
    Method A is applicable to pipes with a nominal size of DN 50 or greater with circumferentially wound filaments, with or without chopped glass and/or woven rovings and/or fillers, and to centrifugally cast pipes. It is applicable to pipes with helically wound filaments with a nominal size of DN 200 or greater.
    Method B is applicable to all types of GRP pipe. It is usually used for pipes with a nominal size up to and including DN 150.
    Method C is primarily intended for use for helically wound pipes with a winding angle other than approximately 90°. This method can also be used for other types of pipe.
    Results from one method are not necessarily equal to the results derived from any of the alternative methods. However, all methods have equal validity.
