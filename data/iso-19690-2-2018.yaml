    This document specifies two different grades of disc springs.
    Grade A defines basic requirements of disc springs for static applications with low and moderate performance. Springs manufactured according to Grade A are not used for dynamic applications.
    Grade B defines requirements on disc springs especially used for dynamic applications and high performance static applications. Disc springs according to Grade B ensure a better quality by higher demands on manufacturing processes and tolerance requirements. Grade B includes graphs showing the guaranteed fatigue life such as a function of stress.
