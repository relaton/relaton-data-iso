    ISO 9635-3:2014 specifies construction and performance requirements and test methods for check valves, intended for operation in irrigation systems with water at temperatures not exceeding 60 °C, which can contain fertilizers and other chemicals of the types and concentrations used in agriculture.
    It is applicable to hydraulically operated check irrigation valves of DN 15 diameter or greater, designed to operate in the fully open and fully closed positions, but which can also operate for extended time periods in any intermediate position.
