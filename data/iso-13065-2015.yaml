    ISO 13065:2015 specifies principles, criteria and indicators for the bioenergy supply chain to facilitate assessment of environmental, social and economic aspects of sustainability.
    ISO 13065:2015 is applicable to the whole supply chain, parts of a supply chain or a single process in the supply chain. ISO 13065:2015 applies to all forms of bioenergy, irrespective of raw material, geographical location, technology or end use.
    ISO 13065:2015 does not establish thresholds or limits and does not describe specific bioenergy processes and production methods. Compliance with ISO 13065:2015 does not determine the sustainability of processes or products.
    ISO 13065:2015 is intended to facilitate comparability of various bioenergy processes or products. It can also be used to facilitate comparability of bioenergy and other energy options.
