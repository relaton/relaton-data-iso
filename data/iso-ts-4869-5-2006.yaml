  content: "ISO/TS 4869-5:2006 specifies a method for measuring noise reduction of
    passive hearing protectors at the threshold of hearing. The method is designed
    to provide estimates of the noise reduction obtained by typical groups of users
    in real-world occupational settings, who may lack the training and motivation
    to wear hearing protectors in an optimum manner. \nThe principle of the test method
    is to measure the difference in hearing threshold with and without wearing a hearing
    protector. This difference between the thresholds constitutes the noise reduction.
    The measurement is done twice on a given number of test subjects.\nThis test method
    yields data that are collected at low sound pressure levels (close to the threshold
    of hearing), but which are also representative of the noise reduction values of
    hearing protectors at higher sound pressure levels. ISO/TS 4869-5:2006 is inapplicable
    for level-dependent hearing protectors for sound pressure levels above the point
    at which their level-dependent characteristics become effective. "
