  script: Latn
  content: "ISO/TS 18226:2006 describes the use of reinforced thermoplastics pipe
    (RTP) systems for transmission of gaseous fuels at maximum operating pressures
    up to and including 40 bars, and service temperatures in the region - 50 °C to
    120 °C, depending on the liner and cover materials. \nISO/TS 18226:2006 relates
    to transmission systems in which wear and damage to the liner are restricted by
    limiting pigging operations to soft pigging only.\nThe recommendations in ISO/TS
    18226:2006 are confined to RTP and its associated in-line fittings and end-fittings.
    Where the other system components (elbows, tees, valves, etc.) are of conventional
    construction, they will be governed by existing standards and codes of practice.\nISO/TS
    18226:2006 specifies a qualification testing procedure for RTP systems. It also
    provides a procedure for reconfirmation of the design basis that may be used for
    product variants where changes have been made in design, materials or the manufacturing
    process. "
