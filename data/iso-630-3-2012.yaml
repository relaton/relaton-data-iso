    This part of ISO 630 specifies requirements for flat and long products of hot-rolled weldable fine-grain structural steels in the as-rolled (for SG grades only), normalized/normalized-rolled and thermomechanical-rolled delivery conditions. It applies to steel plates rolled on a reversing mill, wide flats, hot-rolled sections and bars, which are intended for use in heavily loaded parts of welded or bolted structures.
    This part of ISO 630 covers 11 grades and four qualities. Grades S275, S355, S420 and S460 are covered in Annex A. Grades SG245, SG290, SG325, SG345, SG365, SG415 and SG460 are covered in Annex B. Not all grades are available in all qualities, and some qualities have Charpy V‑notch requirements.
    This part of ISO 630 does not include the following structural steels, some of which are covered by other International Standards:
    — Sheet and strip — refer to ISO TC 17/SC 12, Continuous mill flat rolled products;
    — Tubular products — refer to ISO TC 5/SC 1, Steel tubes.
    NOTE Lists of standards covered by ISO/TC 17/SC 12 and ISO/TC 5/SC 1 are available on the ISO Web site.
