  content: ISO 4381:2011 specifies requirements for bearing metals based on tin casting
    alloys for multilayer plain bearings. The chemical composition and material properties
    refer to the original unprocessed material and are measured on representative
    samples. Testing results on final bearings can differ due to the influence of
    bearing production. Therefore, it is not intended that these results be compared
    with data given in ISO 4381:2011.
