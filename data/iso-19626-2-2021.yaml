    As a connected standard of ISO 19626-1, this document defines the communication interactions between TCP system components and specifies their detailed interfaces — the processes and the APIs of the TCP system components.
    It provides the common communication interface for deployment and implementation of the system components, and their functions in a specific technology-neutral way to those who consider applying and establishing a TCP system.
