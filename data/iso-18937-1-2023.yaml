    This document provides information and general guidance about the methods for measuring the indoor light stability of reflection prints, both colour and monochrome, transparent or translucent films, and photographic prints for backlit displays. This document is relevant to the selection and operation of the methods of exposure to radiation and environmental stress factors described in detail in subsequent parts. It also describes general performance requirements for devices used for exposing printed material to laboratory light sources. Information regarding performance requirements is for producers of artificial accelerated lightfastness devices.
    NOTE       In this document, the term “light source” refers to radiation sources that emit UV radiation, visible radiation, infrared radiation, or any combination of these types of radiation.
    This document does not include test procedures for determining the effects of light exposure on the physical stability of images, supports, or binder materials. However, it is recognized that in some instances, physical degradation such as support embrittlement, image layer cracking, or delamination of an image layer from its support, rather than the stability of the image itself, determines the useful life of a print material.
    Print image stability results determined for one printer model, software settings, colorant, and media combination may not be applicable to another combination.
