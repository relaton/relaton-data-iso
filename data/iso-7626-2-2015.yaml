    ISO 7626-2:2015 specifies procedures for measuring linear mechanical mobility and other frequency-response functions of structures, such as buildings, machines and vehicles, using a single-point translational vibration exciter attached to the structure under test for the duration of the measurement.
    It is applicable to measurements of mobility, accelerance, or dynamic compliance, either as a driving-point measurement or as a transfer measurement. It also applies to the determination of the arithmetic reciprocals of those ratios, such as free effective mass. Although excitation is applied at a single point, there is no limit on the number of points at which simultaneous measurements of the motion response may be made. Multiple-response measurements are required, for example, for modal analyses.
