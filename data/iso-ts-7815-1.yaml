    This part of ISO 7815 provides the following for cooperative telematics applications for regulated commercial freight vehicles directly communicating via a ‘Secure Interface’
    a) A framework for the provision of cooperative telematics application services for regulated commercial freight vehicles;
    b) A description of the concept of operation, regulatory aspects and options and the role models;
    c) A conceptual architecture using an on-board platform and wireless communications to a regulator or his agent;
    d) References for the key documents on which the architecture is based;
    e) Specification of the architecture) of the facilities layer;
    f) A taxonomy of the organisation of generic procedures;
    This part of ISO 7815* does not replace, but is complementary to, ISO 15638-1, and provides an alternative communication architecture to achieve similar service provision by means of a standardised ‘Secure Interface’.
