    The proposed standard is the first part of a comprehensive series of international standards related to energy performance of underfloor air distribution systems. This standard shall stipulate the definition, terminology, technical specification and symbols related to underfloor air distribution systems.
    The new series of ISO standards will be composed of multiple parts as follows (tentatively).
    -
    Part 1: Definitions, terminology, technical specifications and symbols
    Part 2: In-situ measurement of room air stratification
    Part 3: In-situ measurement of thermal decay
    Part 4: Determination of air permeability of underfloor plenum

    This standard does not cover the conventional displacement ventilation system.
