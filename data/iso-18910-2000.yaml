    This International Standard specifies methods for determining and quantitatively expressing the curl characteristics
    of unprocessed and processed photographic film and paper in sheet, roll or strip formats.
    It specifies three measuring methods: method A involves the determination of curl when the specimen is held in a
    vertical position, methods B and C with the specimen in a horizontal position. The values for the three methods are
    not comparable because of the differences in specimen configuration and size.
    These methods are not intended for use in determining the curl characteristics of photographic materials during
    processing or drying.
