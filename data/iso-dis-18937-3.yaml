    This part of ISO 18937 describes test methods for measuring the light stability of photographic prints when subjected to LED (light-emitting diode) illumination sources under conditions that simulate indoor display.
    This document is applicable to all types of colour and monochrome photographic prints made with analogue and digital print processes.   It applies to reflection prints, transparent or translucent films, and prints for backlit displays.
    This document does not include test procedures for determining the effects of light exposure on the physical stability of images, supports, or binder materials.
