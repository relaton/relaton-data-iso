    This document specifies a method for the classification of requirements based on severity and susceptibility. The classification method requires a system in line with the framework described in ISO 24096-1 to form a complete system.
    This document:
    —     gives guidance on the needed elements for a consistent evaluation of the severity over time, and supports a company business model and its brand image;
    —     gives background to why additional parameters alongside severity are useful as a base for classification;
    —     adds susceptibility as a viable parameter along with severity;
    —     gives guidance on the methodology for classification requirements using severity and susceptibility.
