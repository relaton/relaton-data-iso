abstract:
- content: |-
    ISO/IEC 26559:2017, within the context of the tools and methods of variability traceability for software and system product lines:
    -      provides the terms and definitions specific to variability traceability for software and systems product lines;
    -      defines process groups and their processes for establishing and managing variability traceability at product line lifecycle processes. Those processes are described in terms of purpose, inputs, tasks, and outcomes;
    -      defines method capabilities to support the defined tasks of each process;
    -      defines tool capabilities to automate/semi-automate tasks or defined method capabilities.
    ISO/IEC 26559:2017 does not concern processes and capabilities of tools and methods for a single system but rather deals with those for a family of products.
