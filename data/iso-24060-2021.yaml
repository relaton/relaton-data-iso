    This document defines a ship software logging system (SSLS) for logging and retrieving software version information and current operational status. The system facilitates software maintenance for ship operational technology equipment and associated integrated systems, including but not limited to:
    —    control and alarm systems;
    —    fire and water mist systems;
    —    navigation and communication systems;
    —    steering control systems;
    —    propulsion systems;
    —    power generation systems;
    —    performance monitoring systems;
    —    auxiliary systems.
    This document sets requirements for the design and usability of a ship software logging system (SSLS) software that:
    —    records software versions for equipment with updateable software (hereinafter “equipment”);
    —    sets an initial log entry when equipment is first installed or detected by the SSLS;
    —    includes a repository of electronic service reports associated with log entries;
    —    automatically logs reports sent by the equipment.
