- content: |-
    ISO 10845-3:2011 sets out standard conditions of tender which
    - bind the employer and tenderer to behave in a particular manner,
    - establish what a tenderer is required to do in order to submit a compliant tender,
    - make known the evaluation criteria to tenderers, and
    - establish the manner in which the employer conducts the process of offer and acceptance and provide the necessary feedback to tenderers on the outcomes of the process.
    ISO 10845-3:2011 is intended for use in procurements relating to goods, services and construction works and disposals other than by auction.
