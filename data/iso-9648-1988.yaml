  content: The method consists in extraction by shaking with dimethylformamide, then
    after centrifuging, addition of ferric ammonium citrate and ammonia to an aliqiot
    part of the supernatant liquid and spectrometric determination, at 525 nm, of
    the absorbance of the solution thus obtained, and determing of the tannic content
    using a calibration curve prepared using tannic acid.
