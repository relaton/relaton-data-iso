    This document specifies requirements for the selection, placement and fixation of flexible postural support devices within seating devices and systems and to chairs, including wheelchairs and bathroom equipment. Seating devices can be involved in one or more situations, including hoists, static seating, wheelchair seating, shower chairs, etc. The devices enable the seated person (the occupant) to be positioned to maximize their functional activities in a safe environment. These requirements are formulated to achieve a balance of posture maintenance and safety.
    This document covers flexible positioning supports (padded or otherwise) used for postural positioning and/or safety. It does not cover belts and harnesses used in transportation for restraint, postural support devices made from rigid materials such as metal, wood, or hard plastics, or postural support devices designed solely for use in sports-related seating.
