  content: "This standard describes the basic principles and recommended procedures
    for corpus annotation project management as its core model. The core model of
    corpus project management consists of a series of recommended work packages to
    fulfill the basic requirements for error-free corpus annotation with training
    the involved human and validating the intermediate results. Thus, the core model
    contains recommendations below:\n-\tcorpus annotation project organization,\n-\tinternal
    structures and work-packages for corpus annotation project management,\n-\tproject
    team members' qualification,\n-\tworkflow among the internal structures of project."
