    reduced oxygen content and more or less enriched in carbon dioxide in such a way
    that the sum of the contents is 21 % (V/V); type 2 in such a way that the sum
    of the oxygen and the cabon dioxide contents is below 21 % (V/V). Specification
    of the method of regulation of atmospheres, of chambers for controlled atmosphere
    storage, of the regulation of temperature and atmosphere, of the maintenance of
