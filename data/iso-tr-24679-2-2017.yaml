    ISO/TR 24672-2:2017 provides a fire engineering application relative to fire resistance assessment of an airport terminal structure according to the methodology given in ISO 24679‑1. It follows step by step the procedure given by ISO 24679‑1. Some requirements relative to Chinese building regulation are taken into account concerning the fire scenarios.
    The fire safety engineering applied to an airport terminal takes into account the real fire data based in fire tests. It is important to note that the intervention of fire service brigade dedicated to this airport, located approximately 1 km away, has been taken into account in definition of fire scenarios. For the fire modelling, both fire extinguishing system and the smoke extraction are not considered but the fire fighter intervention has been taken into account 10 min after the starting of fire.
