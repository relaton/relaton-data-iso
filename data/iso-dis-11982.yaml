    The proposed document gives guidance for quantification of liquefied natural gas (LNG) as marine fuel on board LNG bunkering ships.
    It is applicable to the measurement of LNG from any source, e.g. gas from conventional reservoirs, shale gas, coalbed methane, at the time of
    - Ship to Ship (STS) transfer to LNG-fuelled ships,
    - Ship to Ship (STS) transfer between LNG bunkering ships, and
    - transfer to or from shore tanks or other facilities, with no regard to the type of tanks.
    This document is also applicable to the quantification of biomethane and synthetic methane from fossil fuels or renewable sources.
