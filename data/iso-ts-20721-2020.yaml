    This document established the currently recognized approaches and special considerations needed when evaluating the in vitro and in vivo performance of absorbable metals and implants fabricated, in whole or in part, from them. This document describes how the evaluation of these metals can differ from those utilized for permanent non-absorbable implantable implants (or subcomponents), in that absorbable metal implants (or subcomponents) are — by design — intended to be absorbed in their entirety by the host.
    This document provides guidance regarding the materials considerations, in vitro degradation/fatigue characterization, and biological evaluation of medical implants made of absorbable metals. The provided content is intended to deliver added clarity to the evaluation of these materials and implants to increase awareness of critical factors and reduce potential for generation of erroneous or misleading test results.
    While this document and the herein described referenced standards contain many suggested alterations or modifications to currently practiced procedures or specifications, the provided content is intended to complement, and not replace, current conventions regarding the assessment of implantable implants.
    This document covers the evaluation of absorbable metal specific attributes in general and is not intended to cover application or implant specific considerations. Thus, it is important to consult relevant implant and/or application specific standards.
    This document does not apply to non-absorbable or non-metallic components (e.g. polymeric coatings, pharmaceuticals, non-absorbable metals) used in conjunction with absorbable metal implants.
