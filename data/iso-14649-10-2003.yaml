    ISO 14649-10:2003 specifies the process data which is generally needed for NC-programming within all machining technologies. These data elements describe the interface between a computerized numerical controller and the programming system (i.e. CAM system or shopfloor programming system). On the programming system, the programme for the numerical controller is created. This programme includes geometric and technological information. It can be described using this part of ISO 14649 together with the technology-specific parts (ISO 14649-11, etc.). ISO 14649-10:2003 provides the control structures for the sequence of programme execution, mainly the sequence of working steps and associated machine functions.
    The "machining_schema" defined in ISO 14649-10:2003 contains the definition of data types which are generally relevant for different technologies (e.g. milling, turning, grinding). The features for non-milling technologies like turning, EDM, etc. will be introduced when the technology specific parts like ISO 14649-12 for turning, ISO 14649-13 for EDM, and ISO 14649-14 for contour cutting of wood and glass are published. It includes the definition of the workpiece, a feature catalogue containing features which might be referenced by several technologies, the general executables and the basis for an operation definition. Not included in this schema are geometric items and representations, which are referenced from ISO 10303's generic resources, and the technology-specific definitions, which are defined in separate parts of ISO 14649.
    ISO 14649-10:2003 cannot stand alone. An implementation needs in addition at least one technology-specific part (e.g. ISO 14649-11 for milling, ISO 14649-12 for turning).
    Additionally, the schema uses machining features similar to ISO 10303-224 and ISO 10303-214. The description of process data is done using the EXPRESS language as defined in ISO 10303-11. The encoding of the data is done using ISO 10303-21.
