- content: |-
    This part of ISO/IEC 10967 de_nes the properties of numerical approximations for many of the
    real elementary numerical functions available in standard libraries for a variety of programming
    languages in common use for mathematical and numerical applications.
    An implementor may choose any combination of hardware and software support to meet the
    speci_cations of this part. It is the computing environment, as seen by the programmer/user, that
    does or does not conform to the speci_cations.
    The term implementation (of this part) denotes the total computing environment pertinent
    to this part, including hardware, language processors, subroutine libraries, exception handling
    facilities, other software, and documentation.
