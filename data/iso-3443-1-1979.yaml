abstract:
- content: Describes the nature of dimensional variability in building and the purposes
    for which it has to be quantified, and defines the factors to be taken into account
    in the evaluation, specification and verification of tolerances for the manufacture
    of building components and for site work. Applies to components and buildings
    generally, including those designed in accordance with the principles of modular
    co-ordination.
