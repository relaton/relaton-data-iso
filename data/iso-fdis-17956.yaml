    This document gives recommendations for the calculation of the effective static safety under consideration of tilting or misalignment, operating clearance of the bearing and internal load distribution on rolling elements. The calculation method provided in this document covers influencing parameters additional to those described in ISO 76.
    The directions and limitations given in ISO 76 and ISO 20056-2 apply to this document. The calculation method pertains to the static safety of the bearings. Other mechanisms of failure, like false brinelling, fatigue life, wear or microspalling (gray-staining), lie outside the scope of this document.
    This document applies to single- and multi-row radial and thrust ball bearings, subjected to radial and axial load and with radial clearance and tilt taken into account. It also applies to single- and multi-row radial and thrust roller bearings, subjected to radial and axial load and with radial clearance, edge stress and tilt taken into account. References to methods for the analysis of the internal load distribution under general load are given.
    The analysis of internal load distribution and modified reference rating life for multi-row bearings or bearings of a more complex geometry can be derived from the formulae given in this document. For these bearings, the load distribution for each individual row has to be considered.
    The calculation of load distribution and nominal reference rating life is also applicable to hybrid bearings, using the static load ratings per ISO 20056-2.
