    ISO 6361-4:2011 specifies the tolerances on shape and dimensions for wrought aluminium and aluminium alloy sheet and plate by hot-rolling or cold-rolling for general engineering applications.
    It applies to products with a thickness over 0,15 mm up to and including 203 mm.
    It does not apply to semi-finished rolled products in coiled form to be subjected to further rolling (reroll stock) or to special products such as those that are corrugated or embossed.
    Technical conditions for inspection and delivery of products covered by ISO 6361-4:2011 are specified in ISO 6361-1.
