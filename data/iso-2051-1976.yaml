  content: The method is applicable to products having a minimum KCL content of about
    95 % (m/m). The principle consists in dissolution of a test portion taken from
    the laboratory sample, previously ground and sifted. Addition of formaldehyde
    solution to transform any ammonium ions present into hexamethylenetetramine, and
    of ethylenedinitrilotetraacetic acid, disodium salt, to complex any extraneous
    cations present which could cause excess errors. These*additions in no case have
    a detrimental effect on its precision or reproducibility. Precipitation of the
    potassium by sodium tetraphenylborate in a weakly alkaline medium, drying and
    weighing of the precipitate.
