  content: "This document outlines methodologies for creating and evaluating AACN
    algorithms, using suitable parameters, to predict the level of injury sustained
    by road users in a collision. \n\nThe injury prediction is used to facilitate
    emergency response after a collision occurs.\n\nThe methodology is based on onboard
    vehicle data and occupant-related information and applies to vehicle occupants
    and vulnerable road users. \n\nThis document is applicable to road vehicles having
    provisions for measuring and communicating crash related data. \n\nThis document
    does not provide recommendations on suitable actions how the risk information
    is further used.\n\nData format for sending vehicle information and communication
    protocol between vehicle and the public service answering point (PSAP) is outside
    the scope of this document."
