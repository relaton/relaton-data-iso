abstract:
- content: |-
    This document describes the on-board J1939 communication interface between a connected device and mobile machines for use in earth-moving, mining and road construction applications to enable interventional collision avoidance actions defined in ISO 21815-1 based on the SAE J1939 protocol. This interface is intended for use by a collision avoidance system (CAS) device integrated independently from the original machine providing intervention signals to slow down, stop or prevent motion of the machine. The protocol defined by this document can also be used to provide input information for a collision warning system (CWS).
    This document is not intended for plug-and-play implementation of CAS or CWS on the machine. Additional details not fully described in this document can be negotiated by the CAS or CWS manufacturer and the machine manufacturer to enable functionality.
    This document does not preclude the possibility of the machine manufacturer or the CxD manufacturer developing alternative on-board communication interfaces.
