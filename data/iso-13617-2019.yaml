    This document covers the design, manufacture, performance, operation, functioning and testing of incinerators intended to incinerate garbage and other shipboard wastes generated during a ship's normal service (i.e. maintenance, operational, domestic and cargo-associated wastes).
    This document is applicable to incinerator plants with capabilities up to 4 000 kW per unit.
    This document is not applicable to systems on special incinerator ships, e.g. for burning industrial wastes such as chemicals, manufacturing residues, etc.
    It does not address the electrical supply to the unit, nor the foundation connections and stack connections.
    This document provides emission requirements in Annex A, location requirements in Annex B, and flue gas temperature requirements in Annex D. Recommendations for incinerators integrated with heat recovery units are given in Annex C.
    The activities associated with this document can involve hazardous materials, operations and equipment. It does not purport to address all of the safety problems associated with its use. It is the responsibility of the user of this document to establish appropriate safety and health practices and determine the applicability of regulatory limitations prior to use.
