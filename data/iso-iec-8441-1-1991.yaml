    This part of ISO/IEC 8441 specifies requirements for
    unrecorded magnetic tape designed for high density
    digital recording (HDDR) having the following
    characteristics:
    a)     nominal thickness 25,4 urn (0,001 in);
    b)     longitudinal magnetic orientation;
    c)     coercivity 72 kA/m (900 Oe) max.
    These tapes are suitable for interchange in accordance
    with ISO/IEC 8441-2.
    Requirements for packaging are also included.
    NOTE 1 Tapes of coercivity above 32 kA/m (400 Oe) are
    usually classified as high energy tapes and users should
    establish compatibility with equipment used for driving
    them.
    Annex A gives guidance on glass and metal-flanged
    reels. Annex B gives information on the wear of recording
    heads. Different categories of environmental
    conditions and their effects on tape are dealt with in
    annex C. Severe operating conditions are considered
    in annex D. Surface electrical resistance
    testing is dealt with in annex E. A tape abrasivity
    testing technique is described in annex F. A list of
    bibliographical references is given in annex G.
    NOTES
    2 It is recognized that archival interchange tapes, or
    those produced by systems in use prior to the publication
    of this part of ISO/lEC 8441, may not comply with the requirements
    and/or recommendations herein.
    3 Various tests and procedures herein refer to recording
    with a.c. HF bias. In practice, certain HDDR systems do
    not use bias. The use of bias in this part of ISO/IEC 8441
    does not imply that the tape so tested is in any way unsuitable
    for a biasless system.
