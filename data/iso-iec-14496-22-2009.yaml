  content: "ISO/IEC 14496-22:2009 specifies the Open Font Format (OFF) specification,
    the TrueType™ and Compact Font Format (CFF) outline formats, and the TrueType
    hinting language. It makes references to both TrueType and PostScript, as Open
    Font Format fonts combine the two technologies.\nMultimedia applications require
    a broad range of media-related standards. In addition to the typical audio and
    video applications, multimedia presentations include scalable 2D graphics and
    text supporting all languages of the world. Faithful reproduction of scalable
    multimedia content requires additional components including scalable font technology.
    The Open Font Format is an extension of the TrueType font format, adding support
    for PostScript font data. OFF fonts and the operating system services which support
    OFF fonts provide users with a simple way to install and use fonts, whether the
    fonts contain TrueType outlines or CFF (PostScript) outlines. \nThe Open Font
    Format addresses the following goals:\n- broader multi-platform support;\n- excellent
    support for international character sets;\n- excellent protection for font data;\n-
    smaller file sizes to make font distribution more efficient;\n- excellent support
    for advanced typographic control.\nPostScript® data included in OFF fonts may
    be directly rasterized or converted to the TrueType outline format for rendering,
    depending on which rasterizers have been installed in the host operating system.
    But the user model is the same: OFF fonts just work. Users will not need to be
    aware of the type of outline data in OFF fonts. And font creators can use whichever
    outline format they feel provides the best set of features for their work, without
    worrying about limiting a font's usability.\nOFF fonts can include the OFF Layout
    tables, which allow font creators to design broader international and high-end
    typographic fonts. The OFF Layout tables contain information on glyph substitution,
    glyph positioning, justification, and baseline positioning, enabling text-processing
    applications to improve text layout. \nAs with TrueType fonts, OFF fonts allow
    the handling of large glyph sets using Unicode encoding. Such encoding allows
    broad international support, as well as support for typographic glyph variants.
    \nAdditionally, OFF fonts may contain digital signatures, which enable operating
    systems and browsing applications to identify the source and integrity of font
    files, including embedded font files obtained in web documents, before using them.
    Also, font developers can encode embedding restrictions in OFF fonts which cannot
    be altered in a font signed by the developer. "
