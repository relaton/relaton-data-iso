    This document specifies the safety requirements for horizontal directional drilling (HDD) machines (hereafter referred to as HDD machines) as defined in ISO 21467:2023 which are designed primarily for drilling through the earth in a mostly horizontal direction.
    This document is applicable to the following HDD machine types:
    portable HDD machines;
    pedestrian-controlled HDD machines;
    towed HDD machines;
    self-propelled HDD machines;
    ride-on HDD machines;
    remote-controlled tramming HDD machines;
    skid-mounted HDD machines;
    pit-launched HDD machines;
    surface-launched HDD machines.
    NOTE Some HDD machines can include a combination of types or characteristics noted above.
