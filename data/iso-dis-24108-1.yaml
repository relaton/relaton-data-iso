    The scopes in this document of international standard for grid square statistics are following:

    ・To present the standard method to enable policy decisions based on common recognition from grid statistics produced with different grid coordinate standards in different countries and areas that may have different geographic coding systems with different geometric shapes.

    ・To standardize methods to accommodate the conversion calculation among grid statistics with different grid coordinate systems having different geometric shapes by employing prorating method based on the grid areas as well as the method to calculate the approximation errors, for exchanging the converted grid statistics.
