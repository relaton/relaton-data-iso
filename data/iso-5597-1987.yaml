  content: 'Establishes the preferred range of nominal dimensions and associated tolerances
    for a series of housings as follows: for cylinders of 16 to 500 mm; for rods of
    6 to 360 mm. For the compact series of ISO 6020-2 the ranges of dimensions are
    as follows: for cylinders of 25 to 200 mm; for rods of 12 to 140 mm. Does not
    give details of seal design. Applies to the dimensional criteria of products;
