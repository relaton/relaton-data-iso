    Storage Management Technical Specification, Part 2 Common Architecture, 1.8.0 Rev 4 defines the core architecture and protocols in SMI-S. The components of SMI-S architecture include:
    - Transport - communicating management information between constituents of the management system
    - Health and fault management - detecting failures through monitoring the state of storage components
    - General information about the object model
    - Names - how SMI-S uses names to allow applications to correlate across SMI-S and to other standards
    - Standard messages - how exceptions are presented to client applications
    - Service discovery - techniques clients use to discover SMI-S services
    - Installation and upgrade - recommendations for implementations
    - Compliance - requirement for compliance to the standard
