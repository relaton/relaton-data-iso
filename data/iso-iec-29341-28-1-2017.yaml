abstract:
- content: "Today multi-screen/second-screen solutions are proliferating. However,
    each is a proprietary vertical for particular vendor(s). Therefore users expectations
    aren't being met:\n-           Seamless interoperability across vendors.\n-           Ability
    for second screen integrated usages rather than 100s of different apps.\nThe UPnP
    Multi-Screen Device Control Protocols (DCPs) provide an open interface to enable
    this interoperability between devices and applications, i.e. enable time-sensitive
    and interactive services, including implementation-specific applications, among
    various display devices.  \nISO/IEC 29341-28-1:2017 describes the overall Multi-Screen
    Architecture, which forms the foundation for the UPnP Multi-Screen Device and
    Service templates. The Multi-Screen Architecture defines the general interaction
    between UPnP control points and UPnP devices defined by the UPnP Multi-Screen
    DCPs."
