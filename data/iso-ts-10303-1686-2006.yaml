- content: "ISO/TS 10303-1686:2006 specifies the application module for\n         Interconnect

    deals with the representation of the information needed to describe the interface
    definition of the interconnect substrate.\n            \t   This view may be used
    for the purpose of electrical and mechanical simulation and verification of the
    \n            \t   interconnect substrate performance when applied in the next
