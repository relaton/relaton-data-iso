  content: |-
    ISO 15782-1:2009 defines a certificate management system for financial industry use for legal and natural persons that includes
    - credentials and certificate contents,
    - Certification Authority systems, including certificates for digital signatures and for encryption key management,
    - certificate generation, distribution, validation and renewal,
    - authentication structure and certification paths, and
    - revocation and recovery procedures.
    ISO 15782-1:2009 also recommends some useful operational procedures (e.g. distribution mechanisms, acceptance criteria for submitted credentials).
    Implementation of ISO 15782-1:2009 will also be based on business risks and legal requirements.
    ISO 15782-1:2009 does not include
    - the protocol messages used between the participants in the certificate management process,
    - requirements for notary and time stamping,
    - Certificate Policy and Certification Practices requirements, or
    - Attribute Certificates.
    While ISO 15782-1:2009 provides for the generation of certificates that could include a public key used for encryption key management, it does not address the generation or transport of keys used for encryption.
