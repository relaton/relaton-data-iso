  content: |-
    ISO/TS 15311-1:2016 defines print metrics, measurement methods and reporting requirements for printed sheets that are suitable for all classes of printed products.
    Guidance as to which of these metrics to apply to any given category of product along with acceptable conformance criteria is provided in subsequent parts of ISO/TS 15311.
    Although ISO/TS 15311-1:2016 is expected to be used primarily to measure prints from digital printing systems, the metrics are general and can be applied to other kinds of print.
