    ISO 3547-5:2007 specifies, following ISO 12301, the checking of the outside diameter of wrapped bushes (ISO 3547-2:2006, methods A, B and D) and describes the necessary checking methods and measuring equipment.
    Wrapped bushes in the free condition are flexible, but after insertion they adapt largely to the shape of the housing bore due to the oversize between the outside diameter of the bush and the housing bore. For this reason, checking of the outside diameter of wrapped bushes can only be carried out under a constraining load by use of specialized measuring equipment.
