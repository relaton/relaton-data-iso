  content: "ISO/IEC 20113:2004 specifies supplementary service Make Call Request (SS-MCR),
    which is related, but not limited to, various basic services supported by Private
    Integrated Services Networks (PISNs). Basic services are specified in ISO/IEC
    11574.\nThe supplementary service MCR enables a Requesting User to request a Co-operating
    User to establish a new Requested Call to a Destination User. This new Requested
    Call between the Co-operating and Destination User can be either a Basic call
    or call independent signalling connection. \nService specifications are produced
    in three stages, according to the method described in ETS 300 387. ISO/IEC 20113:2004
    contains the stage 1 and stage 2 specifications of SS-MCR. The stage 1 specification
    specifies the supplementary service as seen by users of PISNs. The stage 2 specification
    specifies the functional entities involved in the supplementary service and the
    information flows between them."
