    This document establishes technical guidelines for developing and documenting an electrical, electronic and electromechanical (EEE) parts control program, in order to assure that the parts used in the flight hardware are acceptable and possess adequate functional, radiation and reliability characteristics to meet the system requirements. The family of EEE parts includes electro-optical parts.
    This document identifies a set of management guidelines for dealing with space systems engineering activities and defines the minimum existing processes on the subject.
    These guidelines are tailorable to the needs of each individual programme based on the project performance criteria, risk tolerance, budget, mission duration, environment, schedule and other considerations. This document is applicable to all customers and suppliers furnishing flight hardware and is suitable for reference in proposal instructions.
