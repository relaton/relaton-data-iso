  script: Latn
  content: ISO 19438:2003 specifies a multi-pass filtration test, with continuous
    contaminant injection and using the on-line particle counting method, for evaluating
    the performance of fuel filters for internal combustion engines submitted to a
    constant flow rate of test liquid. The test procedure determines the contaminant
    capacity of a filter, its particulate removal characteristics and differential
    pressure. ISO 19438:2003 is applicable to filter elements having a rated flow
    of between 50 l/h and 800 l/h; however, by agreement between filter manufacturer
    and customer, and with some modification, the procedure is permitted for application
    to fuel filters with higher flow rates.
