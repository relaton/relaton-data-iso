  content: ISO 21609:2003 gives requirements and recommendations for the installation
    in road vehicles of radio frequency transmitting and receiving equipment, "in-road-vehicle"
    mounting kits for transportable and handheld RF equipment, and ancillary equipment
    associated with these. As well as methods for installation, it establishes methods
    for minimizing the possibility of electromagnetic interference (EMI) between the
    installed equipment and the vehicle electrical and electronic systems.
