  content: "This document identifies information to be collected and reported to an
    analyst by a user of surface  analysis services regarding the selection and preparation
    of samples presented for surface analysis. Such information is required to ensure
    that the sample has been selected, processed, handled and stored in a manner consistent
    with the analysis objective, to insure the reliability and reproducibility of
    the analyses. This information should also appear, as appropriate to the analyses
    and planned data use, in a data record books, datasheets, certificates of analysis,
    reports or other publications. This information should be in addition to other
    details associated with to specimens to be analyzed, including synthesis information,
    processing history and other characterization that should become part of the data
    record (sometimes identified as provenance information) regarding the source of
    the material and changes that have taken place since it was originated. \n\nThis
    document also includes informative annexes as an aid in understanding the special
    sample handling requirements of surface chemical analysis techniques, particularly:
    Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), Secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS), and
    X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS or ESCA). The information presented may
    also be applicable for other analytical techniques, such as TXRF, that are sensitive
    to surface composition. \n\nThis document does not define the nature of instrumentation
    or operating procedures needed to ensure that the analytical measurements described
    have been appropriately conducted."
