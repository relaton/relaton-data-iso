  content: "This International Standard specifies the additional network feature Common
    Information (ANF-CMN), which is applicable to various basic services supported
    by Private Integrated Services Networks (PISN). Basic services are specified in
    ISO/IEC 11574. \nANF-CMN is an additional network feature which enables the exchange
    of Common Information between entities acting on behalf of the two ends of a connection
    through a PISN. This Common Information is a collection of miscellaneous information
    that relates to the user or equipment at one end of a connection and includes
    one or more of the following: Feature Identifiers, Party Category, Equipment Identity.
    This information, when received by an entity, can be used for any purpose, e.g.
    as the basis for indications to the local user or to another network or in order
    to filter feature requests.\nAdditional network feature specifications are produced
    in three stages, according to the method described in ITU-T Rec. I.130. This International
    Standard contains the stage 1 and stage 2 specifications of ANF-CMN. The stage
    1 specification (clause 6) specifies the additional network feature as seen by
    users of the feature. The stage 2 specification (clause 7) identifies the functional
    entities involved in the additional network feature and the information flows
    between them."
