  content: "ISO 13641-2:2003 specifies a screening method for assessing the potential
    toxicity of substances, mixtures, surface waters, groundwaters and wastewaters,
    effluents, sludges, or other environmental samples by determining the production
    of biogas (carbon dioxide and methane) from muds, sediments and other anaerobic
    environments with low biomass concentration. The growth rate of anaerobic bacteria
    is much lower, compared with that of aerobic microorganisms. For this reason,
    the test periods in anaerobic methods are longer than in those with aerobic bacteria.
    The conditions of this test (for example amount of inoculum and substrate in the
    test bottles) were adopted to a defined test period over several days. The inoculum
    can be collected from anaerobic sediments or from large, or laboratory scale,
    anaerobic digesters.\nThis method is applicable to materials, soluble or insoluble
    in water, including volatile chemicals. \nNote that special care is necessary
    with compounds of low water-solubility, and in these cases, other methods might
    be more suitable.\nInformation obtained by this method may be helpful prior to
    anaerobic biodegradability testing with low inoculum mass concentrations and for
    estimations of the potential effects of chemicals and wastewater to anaerobic
    processes in habitats characterized by a relatively low anaerobic biomass, for
    example natural sediments and soils."
