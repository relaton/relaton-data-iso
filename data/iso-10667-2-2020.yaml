  content: "This document establishes requirements and guidance for one or more service
    provider(s) in working with a client to carry out the assessment of an individual,
    group or organization for work-related purposes and to deliver quality assessment
    services.\nThis document addresses the requirements for the service provider with
    respect to, among other areas:\na)   the choice, integration, implementation and
    evaluation of assessment procedures and methods in making recommendations to a
    client who has an assessment need, carrying out and delivering such assessments,
    and assisting the client in communicating with assessment participants and others;\nb)
    \  the interpretation of assessment results and subsequent reports;\nc)   the
    collection, processing and storage of personal data of assessment participants
    and of assessment data;\nd)   ensuring the required competence and professionalism
    of any person working under its control with a role in the assessment process;\ne)
    \  organizational decisions related to the delivery of assessment services.\nThis
    document also specifies assessment approaches and procedures that can be carried
    out for one or more work-related purposes made by or affecting individuals, groups
    or organizations, including, but not limited to:\n—     employment-related decisions
    (e.g. recruitment, selection, development, appraisal, promotion, outplacement,
    succession planning and reassignment);\n—     career-related decisions (e.g. recruiting,
    coaching, guidance, vocational rehabilitation and outplacement counselling);\n—
    \    group decisions (e.g. training initiatives, team building); \n—     organizational
    decisions (e.g. restructuring, morale and culture initiatives, mergers and acquisitions).\nNo
    detailed technical or professional specifications are included within this document;
    however, an explanation of some of the more common professional quality principles
    used in assessment (e.g. validity, reliability, fairness, standardization) are
    included in Annex B. Despite the informative nature of this annex, the quality
    of assessment procedures and methods is important to the client in relation to
    the purposes of the assessment, the relevance of the measures involved, their
    validity, reliability, fairness, standardization and any issues relating to special
    needs of the assessment participant and other factors that affect the practicality,
    acceptability and utility of the assessment.\nNOTE 1 Requirements for the client
    are specified in ISO 10667-1.\nNOTE 2 See Bibliography for examples of various
    professional guidelines and national standards.\nThis document does not detail
    the specific competences required for assessors as these are dependent upon the
    nature of the assessment.\nNOTE 3 See Annex C for further information on assessor
    competence."
