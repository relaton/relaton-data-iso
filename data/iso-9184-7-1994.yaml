abstract:
- content: 'Specifies two methods for determining the weight factor of fibres used
    in the fibre furnish analysis of paper, board and pulp: by comparison with a reference
    pulp (any pulp that contains only one type of well-defined fibre - mechanical
    pulps and beaten pulps are unsuitable, and whose weight factor is known) or by
    calculating from the fibre coarseness. The methods are applicable to all kinds
    of fibres of pulp from unmixed wood species which do not contain more than 5%
    of other fibres with an essentially different weight factor.'
