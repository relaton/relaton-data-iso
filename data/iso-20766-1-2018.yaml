- content: |-
    This document specifies general requirements and definitions of liquefied petroleum gas fuel system components, intended for use on the types of motor vehicles as defined in ISO 3833. It also provides general design principles, and specifies requirements for instructions and marking.
    This document is applicable to vehicles (mono-fuel, bi-fuel or dual-fuel applications) using gaseous fuels in accordance with ISO 9162. It is not applicable to the following:
    a)    fuel containers;
    b)    stationary gas engines;
    c)    container mounting hardware;
    d)    electronic fuel management; and
    e)    refuelling receptacles.
    NOTE 1    It is recognized that miscellaneous components not specifically addressed herein can be examined for compliance with the criteria of any applicable part of ISO 20766, including testing to the appropriate functional tests.
    NOTE 2    All references to pressure in this document are considered gauge pressures unless otherwise specified.
    NOTE 3    This document applies to devices which have a service pressure in the range of 110 kPa (Butane rich at 20 °C) and 840 kPa (Propane rich at 20 °C), hereinafter referred to in this document. Other service pressures can be accommodated by adjusting the pressure by the appropriate factor (ratio).
