    ISO 15673:2005 applies to the planning, design and construction of structural reinforced concrete structures to be used in new low-rise buildings with restricted occupancy, number of stories, and area. The purpose of ISO 15673:2005 is to provide a registered civil engineer or architect with sufficient information to design the reinforced-concrete structural framing of a low-rise building that complies with these limitations. The rules of design as set forth in ISO 15673:2005 are simplifications of the more elaborate requirements.
    ISO 15673:2005 may be used as an alternative to the development of a national concrete building code, or equivalent document, in countries where no national design codes themselves are available, or as an alternative to the national concrete building code in countries where it is specifically considered and accepted by the national standard body or other appropriate regulatory organization.
