    This document specifies the requirements for the hierarchical taxonomy for specifying operating conditions which enable the definition of an operational design domain (ODD) of an automated driving system (ADS). This document also specifies requirements for the definition format of an ODD using the taxonomy. The ODD comprises specific conditions (which include the static and dynamic attributes) within which an ADS is designed to function.
    This document is mainly applicable to level 3 and level 4 ADS. An ODD for level 5 ADS is unlimited (i.e. operation is possible everywhere).
    This document can be used by organizations taking part in developing safety cases for automated vehicles, in particular, for organizations conducting trials, testing and commercial deployment. This document can also be used by manufacturers of level 3/4 ADS to define the ADS’ operating capability. It may also be of interest to insurers, regulators, service providers, national, local and regional governments to enable them to understand possible ADS deployments and capabilities.
    This document does not cover the basic test procedures for attributes of the ODD. It does not cover the monitoring requirements of the ODD attributes.
