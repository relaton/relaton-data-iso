abstract:
- content: "This standard describes a communication interface between a channel and
    I/O control units that utilize the Single-Byte Command Code Sets (SBCCS) as implemented
    in a wide range of data processing systems. It employs information formats and
    signaling protocols that provide a uniform means for communicating with various
    types of I/O control units, facilitating a high bandwidth, high performance, and
    long distance information exchange environment. The signaling protocols and information
    exchanges are defined at a layer (FC-4) to compatibly utilize the link services
    and other functions provided by the INCITS Fibre Channel Framing and Signaling
    (FC-FS-4) and the INCITS Fibre Channel Link Services (FC-LS-3) specifications.
    This FC-4 Upper Level Protocol is referred to as the Fibre Channel-Single-Byte-6
    Command Code Sets Mapping Protocol (FC-SB-6). \nThis standard modifies the FC-SB-5
    standard to specify enhancements and clarifications to the command-mode and transport-mode
    protocols to increase the efficiency and expand the capabilities of operations."
