    This document provides a framework for assessor training aimed at training providers who design, develop, and/or deliver training courses for assessors conducting assessments conformant with ISO/IEC 33002.
    The document defines four training course elements:
    —     Foundation
    —     Process assessment model
    —     Assessor
    —     Practical assessment performance
    Whilst the training is defined as separate training course elements, the elements can be combined into one or more training courses for delivery. Furthermore, training modules and learning objectives can be addressed in training courses in any combination or sequence.
