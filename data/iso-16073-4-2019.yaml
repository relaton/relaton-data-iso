- content: |-
    This document specifies the minimum performance requirements and methods of test for personal protective equipment (PPE), gloves, that cover the hands whilst wildland firefighting.
    This document covers the general design of the PPE, the minimum levels of performance for the materials employed and the methods of test used. This PPE is not intended to provide protection during fire entrapment. A risk assessment (see ISO/TR 21808) can be undertaken to determine if the gloves covered by this document are suitable for their intended use and the expected exposure.
    This document does not cover PPE for structural firefighting (see ISO 11999‑4), for use against chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear hazards, or for use where a reflective outer surface is required (see ISO 15538).
    Activities in support of wildland firefighting, such as the cutting of trees and the use of a chainsaw can require additional protection to that provided in this document. Users can refer to the relevant standards for the requirements associated with such protection.
