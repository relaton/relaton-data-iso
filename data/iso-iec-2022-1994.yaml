  content: Cancels and replaces the third edition (1986). Specifies the structure
    of 8-bit codes and 7-bit codes which provide for the coding of character sets.
    The codes specified here are designed to be used for data that is processed sequentially
    in a forward direction. Use of these codes in strings of data which are processed
    in some other way, or which are included in data formatted for fixed-length record
    processing, may have undesirable results or may require additional special treatment
    to ensure correct interpretation.
