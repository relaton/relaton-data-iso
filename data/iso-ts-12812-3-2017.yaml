abstract:
- content: |-
    ISO/TS 12812-3:2017 specifies the interoperable lifecycle management of applications used in mobile financial services. As defined in ISO 12812‑1, an application is a set of software modules and/or data needed to provide functionality for a mobile financial service.
    This document deals with different types of applications which is the term used to cover authentication, banking and payment applications, as well as credentials.
    Clause 5 describes the basic principles required, or to be considered, for the application lifecycle management.
    Because several implementations are possible with impacts on the lifecycle, this document describes the different architectures for the location of the application and the impacts of the different scenarios regarding the issuance of the secure element when present (see Clause 6), the different roles for the management of the application lifecycle and the domains of responsibilities (see Clause 7). It also specifies functions and processes in the application lifecycle management (see Clause 8) and describes scenarios of service models and roles of actors (see Clause 9).
