    This document specifies methods for the chemical analysis of metal impurities present in silicon dioxide powders used as a raw material for fine ceramics.
    It stipulates the methods for the determination of metal impurity elements in silicon dioxide powders that are decomposed by acid decomposition. The aluminium, cadmium, calcium, copper, iron, lead, lithium, magnesium, manganese, nickel, potassium, sodium, titanium, zinc and zirconium contents in the test solution are determined by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES).
