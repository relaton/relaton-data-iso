    ISO 18061:2014 specifies a test method for the determination of the antiviral activity of materials that contain photocatalytic materials or have photocatalytic films on the surface, by enumerating the destruction of bacteriophage Q-beta after irradiation of ultraviolet light.
    It is intended for use with different kinds of semiconducting photocatalytic materials used in construction materials, in flat sheet, board, or plate shape that are the basic forms of materials for various applications. It does not include powder, granular, or porous photocatalytic materials.
    It is applicable to photocatalytic materials produced for an antiviral application. Other types of performance of photocatalytic materials, i.e. antibacterial activity, antifungal activity, decomposition of water contaminants, self-cleaning, antifogging, and air purification, are not determined by the test method.
