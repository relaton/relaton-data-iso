    This document specifies the technical delivery conditions for bends made by the induction bending process for use in pipeline transportation systems for the petroleum and natural gas industries as defined in ISO 13623.
    This document is applicable to induction bends made from seamless and welded pipe of unalloyed or low-alloy steels.
    NOTE       These are typically C-Mn steels or low-alloy steels that are appropriate for the corresponding level and grade of line pipe in accordance with ISO 3183.
    This document specifies the requirements for the manufacture of two product specification levels (PSLs) of induction bends corresponding to product specification levels given for pipe in ISO 3183.
    This document is not applicable to the selection of the induction bend PSL. It is the responsibility of the purchaser to specify the PSL, based upon the intended use and design requirements; see also ISO 3183, Introduction.
    This document is not applicable to pipeline bends made by other manufacturing processes.
