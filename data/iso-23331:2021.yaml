    This document specifies the test method for the determination of total electrical conductivity of conductive fine ceramics by the DC (direct current) four-terminal method. The test method applies to conductive fine ceramics which have an ionic transference number of 0,01 or less. The applicable conductivity range is from 1 S cm−1 to 1 000 S cm−1 and the temperature range is up to 1 000 °C. The values expressed in the test method are in accordance with the International System of Units (SI).
    This document is intended for industrial product quality control and material development of conductive fine ceramics used in electrodes, e.g. fuel cells, batteries and water electrolysis.
