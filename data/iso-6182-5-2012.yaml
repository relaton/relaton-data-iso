    ISO 6182-5:2012 specifies performance requirements, methods of test and marking requirements for deluge valves and manufacturer's specified relevant trim used in deluge and pre-action automatic fire protection systems. Deluge valves covered by these requirements can be operated by hydraulic, pneumatic, electric, mechanical, manual, or thermal means, or combinations thereof.
    Performance and test requirements for other auxiliary components or attachments to deluge valves are not covered by ISO 6182-5:2012.
    ISO 6182-5:2012 does not cover thermally operated valves released by heat acting directly on the valve. This type of valve utilizes a thermal device, such as the link-and-lever arrangement or glass bulb of a sprinkler, to hold the valve closed. Operation of the thermal device allows the valve to open.
