    This document specifies test methods as well as test charts for measuring the physical durability attributes of duplex colour prints, typically used in office environment.
    This document is applicable to duplex prints comprising several sheets with colour images printed on both sides of a substrate. A multifunction or single function printer is used to form the duplex prints.
    This document is intended to be used to evaluate the durability of colour prints under environment and stress conditions assuming general office use, including transportation from the place of printing to where practically used. Permanence and durability in archival and storage environments are out of scope of this document and can be evaluated by the methods in ISO 11798.
    The physical durability attributes included are thermal and humidity blocking, water resistance, abrasion resistance and scratch resistance.
    All of these attributes are also applicable to a simplex print set comprising several sheets with colour images printed on one side of a substrate and no image on the other side.
