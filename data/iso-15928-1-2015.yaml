    ISO 15928-1:2015 sets out a method for describing the structural safety performance of houses. It covers objectives, provides performance descriptions, establishes parameter descriptions, and outlines evaluation processes. It includes a description of permanent, imposed, wind, seismic, snow and other actions as well as structural resistance.
    ISO 15928-1:2015 is intended for use in the evaluation of the design and construction of houses, in the international trading of houses or their sub-systems, and in developing risk-management tools for the protection of houses.
    The ISO 15928‑ series does not specify a level of performance and it is not intended to provide a design method and/or criteria.
    It describes the structural safety of a house as a whole.
    NOTE 1       Annex A includes background information on this part of ISO 15928, guidance on its use, and suggestions on good practice.
    NOTE 2       Details on references referred to in Notes are provided in a Bibliography.
    NOTE 3       Structural serviceability, durability and other attributes are covered in other parts of ISO 15928.
