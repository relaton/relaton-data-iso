    This document specifies a method for the assessment of the surface resistance to first visible scratching traces (e. g. scratches, marks) that may also be a change in the gloss.

    It relates to the rigid surfaces of all finished products, regardless of their material.

    It does not apply to finishes on leather and fabrics.

    The test is intended to be carried out on a part of finished furniture. It can however be carried out on test panels of the same material, finished in an identical manner to the finished product, and of a size sufficient to meet the requirements of the test.

    It is essential that the test be carried out on unused surfaces without any defects or damages.
