    This International Standard establishes specifications for the stability of photographic films intended for storage of
    records; specifically, microfilms with a base of safety polyester [poly(ethylene terephthalate)] having predominantly
    silver behenate salts dispersed in nongelatinous emulsions, and thermally processed to produce a black-and-white
    silver image.
    This International Standard applies to thermally processed silver (TPS) microfilms having ultrasonic or dielectric
    (induction-heated) splices. It does not cover films with splices made by means of adhesive tape.
    This International Standard does not cover other types of black-and-white TPS films, black-and-white paper, colour
    images and colour prints that are produced with thermally processed silver behenate systems.
    It does not apply to films to which lacquers have been applied.
    It also does not apply to conventional black-and-white silver images that are produced by wet processing of silvergelatin
    films (see ISO 10602).
