  content: "The proposed International Standard “Impact assessment for museums” is
    planned as follow-up to ISO 18461 \"Information and documentation - International
    museum statistics\" and ISO 21246 “Information and documentation – Key indicators
    for museums”. Its purpose is to define and describe methods for assessing and
    measuring the impact of museums on individuals and on society. \n\nThe methods
    described in the Standard should be adequate for identifying areas of influence
    of museums and their services, and for reporting such influence to stakeholders
    and the general public."
