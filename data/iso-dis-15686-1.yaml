    This International Standard identifies and establishes Concepts, Principles and terminology for service life planning and a systematic framework for undertaking service life planning of a planned building or construction work throughout its life cycle (or remaining life cycle for existing buildings or construction works). The life cycle incorporates initiation, project definition, design, construction, commissioning, operation, maintenance, refurbishment, replacement, deconstruction and ultimate disposal, recycling or re-use of the asset (or parts thereof), including its components, systems and building services.

    This International Standard is applicable to the service life planning of individual buildings. A series of service life plans, developed in accordance with this International Standard, can be used as input data to the strategic property management of a number of buildings.
