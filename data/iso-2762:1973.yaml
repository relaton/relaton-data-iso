  content: The turbidimetric method is applicable to products containing less than
    0.1 % (m/m) of soluble sulphates. The principle consists in evaporation of a test
    portion to dryness and solution of the residue in hydrochloric acid. Measurement
    of the turbidity obtained by precipitation, under well defined conditions, of
    barium sulphate. Has also been approved by the IUPAC.
