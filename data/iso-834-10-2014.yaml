    ISO 834-10:2014 specifies a method for testing fire protection systems applied to structural steel members used in buildings as beams, columns, or tension members. It is intended for use in conjunction with the assessment protocol described in ISO 834‑11. It applies to steel sections (including hollow sections) and only considers sections without openings in the web. Results from analysis of I or H sections are directly applicable to angles, channels, and T-sections for the same section factor, whether used as individual members, e.g. bracing, or part of a fabricated structural system such as a steel truss construction. ISO 834-10:2014 does not apply to solid bar, rod, or concrete-filled hollow sections.
    ISO 834-10:2014 describes the fire test procedures that specify the tests which should be carried out to determine the ability of the fire protection system to remain sufficiently coherent and in position for a well-defined range of deformations, furnace, and steel temperatures, such that the efficacy of the fire protection system is not significantly impaired, and to provide data on the thermal characteristics of the fire protection system when exposed to the standard temperature/time curve specified in ISO 834‑1.
    In special circumstances, where specified in National Building Regulations, there can be a requirement to subject reactive fire protection materials to a smouldering curve. The test and the requirements for its use are described in ISO 834-10:2014 (Annex G).
    ISO 834-10:2014 is applicable to both passive and reactive fire protection systems as defined in the terms and definitions, which are installed or applied in such a way that they remain in place for the intended duration of fire exposure.
    The fire test methodology makes provision for the collection and presentation of data which is then used as direct input into ISO 834‑11 to determine the limits of direct application to steel sections of various shapes, sizes, and fire resistance periods.
