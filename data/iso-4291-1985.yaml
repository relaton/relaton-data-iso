abstract:
- content: Establishes types of contact (stylus) instruments to be used, recommendations
    for their use, procedures for calibration of instruments and verification of their
    characteristics. Applies to a profile transformation, obtained under reference
    conditions. Departures from roundness of the measured profile, procedure, calibration
    and determination of systematic errors of rotation are dealt with in annexes A
    to D, respectively. Annex E gives rules for plotting and reading polar graphs.
    The position of the least squares centre can be calculated from a simple explicit
    equation given in annex F.
