    ISO 19357:2016 specifies the requirements for design, construction, safety, performance, acceptance test and operation of marine cranes for low temperature operation.
    ISO 19357:2016 is applicable to marine cranes of the following types, which are exposed to and operated in low temperatures:
    -      deck cranes mounted on ships for handling cargo or containers in harbour or sheltered water conditions;
    -      floating cranes or grab cranes mounted on barges or pontoons for operating in harbour conditions or sheltered water conditions;
    -      engine room cranes and provision cranes, etc. mounted on ships (including floating docks) for handling equipment and stores in harbour conditions.
    ISO 19357:2016 is not applicable to the following:
    -      minimum ambient operating temperatures no less than −20 °C;
    -      maximum ambient operating temperatures above +45 °C;
    -      transport, assembly, dismantling and decommissioning of cranes;
    -      lifting accessories, i.e. any item between the crane and the load;
    -      lifting operations involving more than one crane;
    -      hand powered cranes;
    -      emergency rescue operations;
    -      shore-side cargo handling cranes;
    -      portable cranes on board;
    -      lifting appliances for lifeboats, liferafts accommodation ladders and pilot ladders;
    -      launching appliances for survival craft and rescue boats;
    -      gangways, accommodation and pilot ladders and their handling appliances.
