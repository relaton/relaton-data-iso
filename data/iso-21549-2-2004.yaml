- content: |-
    ISO 21549-2:2004 establishes a common framework for the content and the structure of common objects used to construct or referenced by other data-object data held on patient healthcare data cards.
    It is applicable to situations in which such data are recorded on or transported by patient healthcards whose physical dimensions are compliant with those of ID-1 cards as defined by ISO/IEC 7810.
    It specifies the basic structure of the data, but does not specify or mandate particular data-sets for storage on devices.
