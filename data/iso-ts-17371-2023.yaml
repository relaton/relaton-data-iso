    This document provides information on the key aspects and details of the process requirements, procedures for selecting service providers, such as travel management company, and procedures for cross-border workers amidst a pandemic, encompassing the complete set of stages from ‘pre-departure’, ‘border crossing’, ‘quarantine and commute’, to ‘return’, and is addressed to all stakeholders involved in travel, whether from the public or private sector.
    NOTE            Stakeholders are comprised of but not limited to health authority, healthcare organization and screening stations, accommodation services, transportation services, travel agencies, and private companies including their contractors and providers.
