    This International Standard specifies the minimum requirements for coated fabrics, and test procedures for those
    fabrics, for use in the construction of inflatable chambers of rescue boats complying with the 1974 Safety of Life at
    Sea Convention (SOLAS), as amended; Chapter I, paragraph 1.2, and Chapter V of the International Life-Saving
    Appliance Code [IMO Resolution MSC.48 (66)]; and the IMO Assembly resolution A.689(17), as amended. These
    coated fabrics consist of a base textile with a synthetic elastomeric or plastomeric compound applied to one or both
    faces.
    Requirements for fabrics for inflatable boats other than SOLAS rescue boats are contained in ISO 6185:1982,
    Shipbuilding and marine structures — Inflatable boats — Boats made of reinforced elastomers or plastomers.
