    This document provides guidelines for cost analysis of the use of reclaimed water in industrial cooling systems.
    This document is intended for new-built industrial cooling systems using reclaimed water as make-up water, in which the reclaimed water originates from industrial wastewater and is generated through wastewater treatment systems for reuse. The source of industrial wastewater is from all the production plants inside the enterprise.
    In this document, the levelized cost of cooling water (LCOCW) is used to compare and determine which industrial cooling system is more expensive per-kilowatt-hour heat removed.
    Use of reclaimed water will have a direct impact on the operating cost of cooling systems and the environment. External benefits, including positive externalities and negative externalities, are provided in Annex A, which considers environmental, social and financial elements.
    This document is intended for all types of stakeholders involved in reclaimed water use in new-built industrial cooling systems.
    This document aims to ensure consistency within any organization engaged in reclaimed water reuse.
    This document provides a broad framework within which costs for new-built industrial cooling systems using reclaimed water can be assessed. The currency used is local currency (LCY).
