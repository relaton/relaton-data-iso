    ISO 14814:2006 establishes a common framework to achieve unambiguous identification in ITS/RTTT (Intelligent Transport Systems/Road Transport and Traffic Telematics) AVI/AEI (Automatic Vehicle Identification/Automatic Equipment Identification) applications.
    This scheme and Reference Architecture Model is designed to be an "enabling" structure to allow interoperability between different commercial systems, and not prescriptive in determining any one system. It is not frequency- nor air interface protocol-specific, provides maximum interoperability, has a high population capability, and provides the possibility of upwards migration to more capable systems.
    ISO 14814:2006 provides a reference structure which enables an unambiguous identification and also identifies the data construct as an ITS/RTTT message. The construct also identifies which ITS/RTTT data structure is contained in the message.
