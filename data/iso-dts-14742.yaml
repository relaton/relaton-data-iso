abstract:
- content: "This document provides a list of recommended ISO cryptographic algorithms
    for use within applicable ISO TC68 – Financial Services standards.  It also provides
    strategic guidance on key lengths and associated parameters and usage dates.\n\nThis
    document deals primarily with recommendations regarding algorithms and key lengths.
    \ For standards on key management, see ISO 11568 ([18], [19], and [20]).\nThe
    categories of algorithms covered are:\na)\tBlock ciphers – \nb)\tStream ciphers
    – \nc)\tTweakable ciphers – \nd)\tHash functions – \ne)\tMessage authentication
    codes (MACs) – \nf)\tAsymmetric algorithms \n1)\tDigital signature schemes giving
    message recovery\n2)\tDigital signatures with appendix\n3)\tAsymmetric ciphers\ng)\tAuthenticated
    encryption algorithms \nh)\tAuthentication mechanisms\ni)\tKey wrapping \nj)\tKey
    derivation, establishment and agreement mechanisms \nk)\tKey transport mechanisms.\nThis
    document does not define any cryptographic algorithms; however the standards to
    which this document refers may contain necessary implementation information as
    well as more detailed guidance regarding choice of security parameters, security
    analysis, and other implementation considerations."
