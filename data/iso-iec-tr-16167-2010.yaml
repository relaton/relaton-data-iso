  content: "ISO/IEC TR 16167:2010 discusses issues related to emergency calls from
    an enterprise user to a public or enterprise emergency response centre (ERC) using
    the Session Initiation Protocol within the Next Generation Corporate Network.
    It uses terminology and concepts developed in ISO/IEC TR 12860. It identifies
    a number of requirements impacting Next Generation Network standardization and
    concerning deployment of enterprise networks. \nThe scope of ISO/IEC TR 16167:2010
    is limited to calls from an enterprise user to an authority, where the authority
    is represented by a public or a private ERC. This includes the special case where
    a private ERC acts as an enterprise user in making an emergency call to a public
    ERC."
