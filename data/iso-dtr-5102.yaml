abstract:
- content: "This document sets out test methods for fibre-reinforced plastic working
    towers made of \nprefabricated elements.\nThis document only encompasses fibre
    reinforced plastic working towers made of prefabricated \nelements，It can be designed
    with reference to EN 1004-1. \nThis document does not apply to working towers
    made of materials other than fibre-reinforced \nplastic. This document does not
    apply to scaffolds according.\nThis document is not for the purpose of in-service
    testing of fibre reinforced plastic working towers. \nNote: Product which has
    been tested in accordance with this document must be destroyed after \ntesting.
    \nWorking towers are temporary works equipment that have dimensions which are
    fixed by the design \nwith a height up to 12 m (indoors) and up to 8 m (outdoors)."
