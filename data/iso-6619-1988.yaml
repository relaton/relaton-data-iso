abstract:
- content: Gives a method for the determination of acidic constituents in products
    soluble or nearly soluble in mixtures of toluene and propan-2-ol. It is applicable
    for the determination of acids whose dissociation constants in water are greater
    than 10-9. The method may be used to indicate relative changes that occur in an
    oil during use under oxidizing conditions regardless of the colour or other properties
    of the resulting oil. No general relationship between bearing corrosion and acid
    or base numbers is known.
