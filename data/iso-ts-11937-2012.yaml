    ISO/TS 11937 provides requirements to describe the basic characteristics of titanium dioxide in powder form relevant for applications in nanotechnology. It is intended to detail the materials specification necessary to use titanium dioxide in the applications related to nanotechonology.
    It is limited to dry powders and does not include materials dispersed or suspended in water or solvents.
    It does not cover characteristics for health and safety issue, and for specific application of titanium dioxide or for surface modification, if coated.
