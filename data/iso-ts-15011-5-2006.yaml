abstract:
- content: |-
    ISO/TS 15011-5:2006 specifies procedures for obtaining information about thermal degradation products generated when welding, cutting through, preheating and straightening products composed wholly or partly of organic substances, e.g. shop primers, paints, adhesives, waxes, sealants, pressing lubricant, oils, etc. It is aimed primarily at test laboratories performing such procedures. The data generated may be used by product manufacturers to provide information for inclusion in safety data sheets and by occupational hygienists to identify thermal degradation products of significance in the performance of risk assessments and/or workplace exposure measurements. The data cannot be used to estimate workplace exposure directly.
    ISO/TS 15011-5:2006 is applicable to all products composed partly or wholly of organic materials that could be heated, during welding and cutting, to temperatures at which thermal degradation products are generated and where it is not apparent what those degradation products will be.
