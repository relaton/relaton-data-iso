    This document specifies the characteristics of pipes (mains, sub-mains and laterals) made from polyethylene (PE), intended for the conveyance of water for irrigation, at a water temperature up to 45 °C.
    NOTE 1  For the effect of water temperature on the maximum operating pressure, see Annex A.
    This document applies to pipes that will not be subjected to internal pressure for long periods, and not more than 1 500 hours/year. For piping applications with long-term continuous pressure, the ISO 4427 series applies.
    NOTE 2  The expected lifetime of pipes covered by this document is ten years or less.
    This document also specifies the properties of the material and the parameters for the test methods to which it refers.
