abstract:
- content: |-
    ISO 15801:2004 describes the implementation and operation of information management systems which store information electronically and where the issues of trustworthiness, reliability, authenticity and integrity are important. The whole life cycle of a stored electronic document is covered, from initial capture to eventual destruction.
    ISO 15801:2004 is for use with any information management system, including traditional document imaging, workflow and COLD/ERM technologies, and using any type of electronic storage medium including WORM and rewritable technologies.
    ISO 15801:2004 does not cover processes used to evaluate the authenticity of information prior to it being stored or imported into the system. However, it can be used to demonstrate that output from the system is a true reproduction of the original document.
