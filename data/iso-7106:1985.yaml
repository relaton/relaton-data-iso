abstract:
- content: A test portion is evaporated at ambient temperature and the oil contained
    in the residue is extracted with carbon tetrachloride. The oil contained in the
    residue is determined either gravimetrically by evaporation of the organic solvent
    and weighing of the residue or by spectrometric measurement of the absorbance
    of the organic phase at a wavelength of approximately 3.42 m. The gravimetric
    method is applicable to products having an oil content equal to or greater than
    10 mg/kg. The infra-red spectrometric method, being more sensitive, is applicable
    to products having an oil content greater than 1 mg/kg.
