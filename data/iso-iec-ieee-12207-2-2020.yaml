- content: |-
    This document provides the mapping expressing corresponding relations between software life cycle processes in ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2017 and the processes in ISO/IEC 12207:2008.
    These relations are demonstrated by means of mapping tables that show relationships between activities and tasks, and process outcomes.
    This mapping assists users of ISO/IEC 12207:2008 to transition to using ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2017.
    This document will help users understand the differences between the reference processes and requirements of the two editions of ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207, and any potential gaps or process enhancements that can be needed in seeking conformance to and/or using ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2017. Also, this document provides to such users the mapping which helps to identify corresponding process outcomes, activities and tasks of processes for software systems in ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2017.
    The mapping between ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2017 and ISO/IEC 12207:2008 in this document can be used as a basis to continuously conduct, improve and extend current process assets including software specific process assets based on ISO/IEC 12207:2008 for effective implementation of ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2017. These process activities and tasks can be applied iteratively.
