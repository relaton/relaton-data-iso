- content: |-
    This International Standard describes a procedure for the detection of a DNA sequence of a construct used to (genetically) enhance the growth of fish commonly found in aquaculture. The genetically modified AquAdvantage Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) carries this construct and can be detected based on a real-time PCR targeting the border between the growth hormone coding sequence (CS-GHc2) of Oncorhynchus tshawytscha (Chinook salmon) and the antifreeze terminator (T-AFP) of (Macro-) Zoarces americanus (ocean pout). This method can be applied to identify the GM fish or for screening purposes.

    This part of the ISO 21569 series is applicable for the analysis of DNA extracted from foodstuffs. It may also be suitable for the analysis of DNA extracted from other products such as feedstuffs. The application of these methods requires the extraction of an adequate amount of amplifiable DNA from the relevant matrix.
