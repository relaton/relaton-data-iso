    ISO/ASTM 51401:2013 covers the preparation, testing, and procedure for using the acidic aqueous silver dichromate dosimetry system to measure absorbed dose to water when exposed to ionizing radiation. The system consists of a dosimeter and appropriate analytical instrumentation. For simplicity, the system will be referred to as the dichromate system. The dichromate dosimeter is classified as a type I dosimeter on the basis of the effect of influence quantities. The dichromate system can be used as either a reference standard dosimetry system or a routine dosimetry system.
    ISO/ASTM 51401:2013 is one of a set of standards that provides recommendations for properly implementing dosimetry in radiation processing, and describes a means of achieving compliance with the requirements of ISO/ASTM Practice 52628 for the dichromate dosimetry system. It is intended to be read in conjunction with ISO/ASTM Practice 52628.
    ISO/ASTM 51401:2013 describes the spectrophotometric analysis procedures for the dichromate system. It applies only to gamma radiation, X-radiation/bremsstrahlung, and high energy electrons.
