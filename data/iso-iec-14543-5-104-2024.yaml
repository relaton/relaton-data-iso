  content: This document specifies the remote access (RA) server-based application
    framework, device interaction model, flow process and interfaces, and message
    formats to achieve intelligent grouping, resource sharing and service collaboration
    among IGRS smart lock devices. This document is applicable to smart lock devices
    with direct network connections or connections through an intermediary network
    to a server for security authentication. This server utilizes a method to minimize
    the possibility of unauthorized access to these smart locks, while maintaining
    seamless interoperability among users, smart lock devices and RA servers at home,
    office or other remote environments.
