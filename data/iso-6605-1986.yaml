abstract:
- content: Gives methods for testing and evaluating performance of hose assemblies
    (hose and attached end fittings) used in hydraulic systems. Specific tests and
    performance criteria for evaluating hose assemblies used in hydraulic service
    are in accordance with the requirements for hose in ISO 1436, ISO 3862, ISO 3949
    and ISO 4079. Further establishes a uniform means of testing and evaluating performance
    of hose assemblies.
