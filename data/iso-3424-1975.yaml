abstract:
- content: The apparatus required consisting of the essential parts as funnel, calibrated
    cylindrical receiver and closure plate (to cover the bottom of the funnel), is
    shown in a figure. The funnel may be constructed of any suitable material, for
    example, stainless steel, plastics or wood. The test is carried out by determining
    the mass of the product in the receiver of known dimensions after running the
    sample out of the funnel of specified shape under specified conditions.
