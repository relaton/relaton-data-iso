abstract:
- content: Includes the requirements for these components for use in aircraft electrical
    systems having voltage and frequency characteristics conforming to ISO/R 222,
    at any ambient temperature from -65 to + 85 °C, and all altitudes from 0 to 24
    000 m. Gives terminology, requirements for dimensions, temperature and altitude
    rating, current, voltage and breaking-capacity ratings, environment, temperature
    rise, time/current characteristics, endurance, identification and marking, tests,
    type tests, production routine test, production quality tests and a method of
    measurement of voltage drop.
