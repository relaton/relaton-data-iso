    This document applies to Liquefied Petroleum Gas vehicle nozzles and receptacles, hereinafter referred to as devices, constructed entirely of new, unused parts and materials. Liquefied Petroleum Gas fuelling connectors consist of the following components, as applicable:
    a)    nozzle (mounted on dispenser side) (see Clause 5);
    b)    receptacle (mounted on vehicle) (see Clause 7).
    This document applies to devices which have a gauge service pressure in the range of 110 kPa (Butane rich at 20 °C) and 840 kPa (Propane at 20 °C), hereinafter referred to as [see 9.1 c)]:
    —          J15;
    —          K15.
    This document also applies to:
    —          devices with standardized mating components;
    —          connectors which prevent Liquefied Petroleum Gas vehicles from being fuelled by other gaseous fuels station dispensers; and
    —          Liquefied Petroleum Gas in accordance with ISO 9162.
    NOTE       All references to pressures (kPa) throughout this document are considered gauge pressures unless otherwise specified.
    This document does not apply to the fuel system of vehicle, with the exception of the Liquefied Petroleum Gas receptacle.
