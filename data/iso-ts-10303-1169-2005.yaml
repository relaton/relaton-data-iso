    ISO 10303-1169:2005 specifies the application module for Activity structure and classification.
    The following are within the scope of ISO 10303-1169:2005:
    - the existence of an individual activity;
    - a whole-part relationship between two individual activities;
    - a connection relationship between two individual activities;
    - an involvement of a product, document, person, organization or other activity in an individual activity;
    - the existence of a class of activity;
    - a mapping between one class of activity and another that indicates the nature of a whole-part relationship between two individual activities;
    - a mapping between one class of activity and another that indicates the nature of a connection relationship between two individual activities;
    - a mapping between a class of activity and another class that indicates the nature of an involvement in an activity;
    - set theory relationships, such as subset, union and intersection, between classes of activity and between mappings;
    - the classification of an individual activity as a member of a class of activity;
    - the classification of a relationship between individual activities as a member of a mapping;
    - the specification of the complete membership of a class of activity or of a mapping between classes of activity;
    - reference to an externally defined class of activity or activity relationship.
