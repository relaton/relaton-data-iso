  content: "Interoperability involves the ability to use assistive technology (AT)
    to add to or augment existing components of information technology (IT) systems.
    Interoperability between AT and IT is best facilitated via the use of standardized,
    public interfaces for all IT components.\nISO/IEC 13066-1:2011 provides a basis
    for designing and evaluating interoperability between IT and AT. It formalizes
    the layered architecture of hardware-to-hardware, hardware-to-software, and software-to-software
    connections that have long been implicit in the IT definitions of ISO/IEC JTC
    1. It also recognizes the central role that accessibility application programming
    interfaces (accessibility APIs) play in aiding this interoperability.\nISO/IEC
    13066-1:2011 identifies a variety of APIs that are described further in other
    parts of ISO/IEC 13066. These APIs can be used as frameworks to support IT-AT
    interoperability.\nISO/IEC 13066-1:2011 does not define or require specific technology,
    commands, APIs, or hardware interfaces. It defers to other existing standards
    and supports the development of new standards in these areas. \nIt identifies
    a variety of common accessibility APIs that are described further in other parts
    of ISO/IEC 13066."
