abstract:
- content: "The objective of International Workshop Agreement IWA 4:2005 is to provide
    local governments with guidelines for the voluntary application of ISO 9001:2000
    on an integral basis. These guidelines do not, however, add, change or modify
    the requirements of ISO 9001:2000. \nFor a local government to be considered reliable,
    it should guarantee minimum conditions of reliability for the processes that are
    necessary to provide all the services needed by its citizens in a consistent and
    reliable manner. All the local government's processes, including management, core,
    operational and support processes, should constitute a single, integral, quality
    management system. The integral character of this system is important because,
    otherwise, although a local government could be reliable in some areas of activity,
    it may be unreliable in others. For a government to be considered reliable, it
    should guarantee minimum conditions of reliability for all key processes and services.
    To achieve this, it is advisable that the local government clearly identify the
    management, core and support processes that, together, make it reliable (see Annex
    A). Annex B provides a diagnostic tool for local governments to evaluate the scope
    and maturity of their processes and services. "
