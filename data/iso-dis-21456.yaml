abstract:
- content: "This document describes the test method for the determination of the residual
    stress of the TGO layer in thermal barrier coating by photoexcitation fluorescence
    piezoelectric spectroscopy.\nThis test method requires that there must be a Cr
    element in the bond coat of the thermal barrier coating, i.e., Cr element shall
    exist in the TGO layer.\nThis test method of determining the residual stress in
    the TGO layer of the thermal barrier coating system is not limited by the preparation
    method of the thermal barrier coatings. Particularly, the thermal barrier coating
    system prepared by EB-PVD has a better effect. \nThis method provides guidance
    on determining reliable estimates of residual stresses from fluorescence spectral
    data and estimating uncertainties in the results."
