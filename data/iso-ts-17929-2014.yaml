    ISO 17929:2014 has been drawn up with the objective of ensuring the safety of amusement ride passengers, based on the international experience of manufacture and operation of such structures throughout the world gained over decades prior to its publication.
    It enables the identification of potential hazards and classification of biomechanical effects, including information on recommended acceleration limits, rate of their onset and their duration, to ensure acceptable degrees of biomechanical risks at the stage of amusement ride design, as well as to take such risks into account during development of operational procedures and information on use limitations for amusement ride guests.
    It gives recommendations regarding use limitations for amusement rides in accordance with the health condition and the well-being of passengers. It also specifies body dimensions of passengers 1,20 m to 2,0 m in height for motion risk analysis on amusement rides. These body dimensions can be taken into account when designing passenger containments and restraints.
    It does not cover devices used in the circus, theatre or sports, or other devices intended for use only by specially trained people. Nevertheless, it can be used in the design of any similar structural or passenger-carrying device even if it does not explicitly mention the device.
    ISO 17929:2014 is not applicable to amusement rides put into operation before the date of its publication.
