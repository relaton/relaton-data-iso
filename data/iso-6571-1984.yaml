  content: Describes a method the principle of which consists in distilling an aqueous
    suspension of the product and collecting the distillate in a graduated tube containing
    a measured volume of xylene to fix the volatile oil. After separation of the organic
    from the aqueous phases the total volume of the organic phase is read and the
    volatile oil content is calculated after deduction of the volume of xylene. The
    test parameters for different spices, condiments and herbs are indicated in an
    annex.
