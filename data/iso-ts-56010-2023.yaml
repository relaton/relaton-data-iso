Descriptions, examples, and infographics are used throughout this document, both to illustrate concepts and to differentiate between concepts. The examples have been chosen from a variety of industries and sectors with a focus on different types of innovations and are non-exhaustive.

    —     An introduction: Interested parties can be onboarded to the documents published as part of the ISO 56000 family of standards, bridging the gaps between alternative views, beliefs, and conceptions of innovation and the science and practice of innovation management.
    —     A guideline: This document presents key technical definitions and concepts in a descriptive format suited to broad and non-technical audiences and can be used to provide basic understanding to organizations, academia, media, and other interested parties as the agreed upon standards become available to the world.
