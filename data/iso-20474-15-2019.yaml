    This document gives the safety requirements specific to compact tool carriers. It is intended to be used in conjunction with ISO 20474‑1, which specifies general safety requirements common to two or more earth-moving machine families. The specific requirements given in this document take precedence over the general requirements of ISO 20474‑1.
    This document deals with all significant hazards, hazardous situations and events relevant to the earth-moving machinery within its scope (see ISO 20474‑1:2017, Annex A) when used as intended or under conditions of misuse reasonably foreseeable by the manufacturer. It specifies the appropriate technical measures for eliminating or reducing risks arising from relevant hazards, hazardous situations or events during commissioning, operation and maintenance.
    This document is not applicable to machines manufactured before the date of its publication.
