abstract:
- content: "ISO/TR 14232-2:2017 gives guidelines for selecting the powder chemistry
    or composition for obtaining an objective coating performance. \nIt provides comparisons
    of coating performance for wear resistance (Table 1) and corrosion resistance
    (Table 2) to spray powder chemistry/composition. The wear types shown in Table
    1 are abrasive, adhesive, chemical, erosion, fretting, impact, rolling and sliding.
    The corrosion types shown in Table 2 are acid/alkaline/salt, atmospheric, biochemical,
    biological, chemical agent, chemicals in food, combustion gas, sea water, fresh
    water, molten metal, molten salt, non-aqueous solution, soil, steam and miscellaneous.
    The tables give the coating chemistries and describe the composition of spray
    powder of metals/alloys, ceramics and cermets. The guidelines have been produced
    on the basis of academic literature, in particular the Journal of Thermal Spray
    Technology and the Proceedings of the International Thermal Spray Conference."
