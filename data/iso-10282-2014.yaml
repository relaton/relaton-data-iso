    ISO 10282:2014 specifies requirements for packaged sterile rubber gloves intended for use in surgical procedures to protect the patient and the user from cross-contamination. It is applicable to single-use gloves that are worn once and then discarded. It does not apply to examination or procedure gloves. It covers gloves with smooth surfaces and gloves with textured surfaces over part or the whole glove.
    ISO 10282:2014 is intended as a reference for the performance and safety of rubber surgical gloves. The safe and proper usage of surgical gloves and sterilization procedures with subsequent handling, packaging, and storage procedures are outside the scope of ISO 10282:2014.
