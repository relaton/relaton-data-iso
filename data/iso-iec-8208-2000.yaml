    This International Standard specifies the procedures, formats and
    facilities at the Packet Layer for Data Terminal Equipment (DTE)
    operating in conformance with ITU-T Recommendation X.25.
    Both Virtual Call and Permanent Virtual Circuit modes of
    operation are covered.
    The Packet Layer protocol specified herein can be used in both
    Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) and non-OSI environments.
    When used within the context of OSI, the Packet Layer protocol
    is encompassed in the Network Layer of the OSI Reference
    Model, ITU-T Rec. X.200 | ISO/IEC 7498-1.
    This International Standard covers DTE operation at the Packet
    Layer when accessing a public or private packet-switched
    network conforming to ITU-T Recommendation X.25 by means
    of a dedicated path or a circuit-switched connection. It also
    covers the additional Packet Layer procedures necessary for two
    DTEs conforming to this International Standard to communicate
    directly (i.e., without an intervening packet-switched network)
    over a dedicated path, a circuit-switched connection, or a local
    area network (LAN).
    This International Standard also covers private networks that use
    ITU-T Recommendation X.25 to connect to packet-switched
    public data networks and that may also offer an X.25 interface to
    a DTE (see annex A).
    To evaluate conformance of a particular implementation, it is
    necessary to have a statement of which capabilities and options
    have been implemented. Such a statement is called a Protocol
    Implementation Conformance Statement (PICS), as defined in
    ITU-T Rec. X.290 | ISO/IEC 9646-1. Annex B provides the PICS
    proforma in accordance with the relevant guidance given in ITUT
    Rec. X.296 | ISO/IEC 9646-7.
    The first edition of this International Standard was based on the
    1984 CCITT Red Book text of Recommendation X.25. It also
    contained the necessary provisions for compatibility with the
    earlier 1980 CCITT Yellow Book text of Recommendation X.25.
    The second edition was based on the 1988 CCITT Blue Book
    text of Recommendation X.25. The third edition is based upon
    the 1993 version of X.25. This fourth edition is based on the
    1996 version of X.25. Retained within this fourth edition are the
    necessary provisions for compatibility with the 1993, 1988, 1984
    and 1980 versions of X.25. The differences between various
    editions of this International Standard are summarized in annex
    C.
    CCITT Recommendation X.613 (1992) | ISO/IEC 10588 : 1993,
    Information technology  Use of X.25 Packet Layer Protocol in
    conjunction with X.21/X.21bis to provide the OSI connectionmode
