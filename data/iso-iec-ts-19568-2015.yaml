abstract:
- content: |-
    ISO/IEC TS 19568:2015 describes extensions to the C++ Standard Library (1.2). These extensions are classes and
    functions that are likely to be used widely within a program and/or on the interface boundaries between libraries written
    by different organizations.
    ISO/IEC TS 19568:2015 is non-normative. Some of the library components in this technical specification may be
    considered for standardization in a future version of C++, but they are not currently part of any C++ standard. Some of
    the components in this technical specification may never be standardized, and others may be standardized in a
    substantially changed form.
    The goal of ISO/IEC TS 19568:2015 is to build more widespread existing practice for an expanded C++ standard
    library. It gives advice on extensions to those vendors who wish to provide them.
