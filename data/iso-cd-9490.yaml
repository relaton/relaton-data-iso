abstract:
- content: "This recommended standard addressees protocols and operational Space Traffic
    Coordination (STC) requirements critical to ensure flight safety and mitigate
    collision risk, from pre-launch safety assessment through manoeuvre plans, on-orbit
    collision avoidance support services, and end of mission disposal.  This standard
    levies requirements of an STC system that will facilitate the provision of high-availability,
    timely, comprehensive and sufficiently accurate services to support the safe,
    efficient, and sustainable use of space.  \nThis STC standard addresses:\n•\tProtocols
    for collection and exchange of data relevant to space safety;\n•\tProtocols for
    creating, populating and operating an open architecture data repository to facilitate
    open data exchange;\n•\tData integrity measures and standards to ensure quality
    from diverse sources;\n•\tSpace Situational Awareness (SSA) data derived from
    multiple and diverse sources. \n•\tMeasures to safeguard proprietary or sensitive
    data;\n•\tOwner-operator notification of flight plans and planned manoeuvres and
    sharing of orbital location data (ephemerides)\n•\tTimely and actionable warnings;
    sharing of catalogue data, to predict close approaches;\n•\tInteroperable formats
    to enable reliable messaging STC inputs and results, timely and actionable warnings,
    referencing extant CCSDS standards where applicable;\n•\tExchange of catalogue
    data to predict close approaches and assess options for operator collision avoidance
    manoeuvre plans. \n•\tFormats to enable development of applications to leverage
    data and perform automated processes for collision avoidance. \n•\tData protection
    measures\n•\tCoordination for satellites transiting Large Constellation (LC) radial
    shells\n\nThis standard requires flexibility to accommodate our deeper understanding
    of the impacts upon the space environment created by increased and emerging space
    activities and to benefit from technological advances and refined capabilities."
