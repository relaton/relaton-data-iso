    This Technical Report gives information concerning the design criteria for nuts specified in ISO 898-2 so that, under static tensile overload, the stripping fracture mode is prevented.
    The design criteria are also applicable to non-standardized nuts or internally threaded elements with ISO metric screw threads (in accordance with ISO 68-1) mating with bolts. However, dimensional factors such as the width across flats or other features related to rigidity of nuts, and thread tolerances can affect the load ability of the individual bolt and nut assemblies. Therefore, it is intended that verification tests be carried out.
    NOTE The terms "bolt" and "nut" are used as the general terms for externally and internally threaded fasteners,
    respectively.
