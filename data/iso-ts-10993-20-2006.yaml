    ISO/TS 10993-20:2006 presents an overview of immunotoxicology with particular reference to the potential immunotoxicity of medical devices. It gives guidance on methods for testing for immunotoxicity of various types of medical devices.
    ISO/TS 10993-20:2006 is based on several publications written by various groups of immunotoxicologists over the last few decades in which the development of immunotoxicology as a separate entity within toxicology took place.
