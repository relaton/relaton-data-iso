    ISO 16063-21:2003 describes the calibration of rectilinear vibration transducers by comparison. Although it mainly describes calibration using direct comparison to a standard calibrated by primary methods, the methods described can be applied between other levels in the calibration hierarchy.
    ISO 16063-21:2003 specifies procedures for performing calibrations of rectilinear vibration transducers by comparison in the frequency range from 0,4 Hz to 10 kHz. It is primarily intended for those who are required to meet ISO standardized methods for the measurement of vibration under laboratory conditions, where the uncertainty of measurement is relatively small. It can also be used under field conditions, where the uncertainty of measurement may be relatively large.
    From knowledge of all significant sources of uncertainty affecting the calibration, the expanded uncertainty can be evaluated using the methods given in ISO 16063-21. It also covers the assessment of uncertainties for calibrations performed using a check standard.
    This document is applicable to calibrations outside the frequency range from 0,4 Hz to 10 kHz, considering the additional facts described in 4.3. Systems have been demonstrated to cover the range from 0,01 Hz to 30 kHz.
