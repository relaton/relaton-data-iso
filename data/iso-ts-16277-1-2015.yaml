abstract:
- content: |-
    ISO/TS 16277-1:2015 defines a categorial structure for clinical findings in terminological systems for Traditional Chinese Medicine, Traditional Japanese Medicine, and Traditional Korean Medicine (TM-CJK). This Technical Specification defines three subcategories: pattern-TM, disorder-TM and sign&symptom-TM. Concept representations within these three categories are used to describe the states of patients in clinical records and communications.
    This Technical Specification is not applicable to:
    -      a comprehensive categorial structure for TM-CJK;
    -      an exhaustive list of all possible characterizing concepts that could be used to describe clinical findings;
    -      terms/descriptions for individual TM-CJK concepts;
    -      a detailed terminology of clinical findings in TM-CJK;
    -      categorical structure of diagnosis and treatment on clinical findings in TM-CJK.
    NOTE          This Technical Specification is limited to a subpopulation of clinical findings in traditional medicine. Other types of clinical findings are represented in ISO/TS 22789 although it has not been tested for this purpose.
