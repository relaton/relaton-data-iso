abstract:
- content: "This document defines a basic framework with principles, characteristics
    and approaches for the realization and enhancement for automated artificial intelligence
    (AI) systems’ controllability.\n\nThe following areas are covered:\n―\tState observability
    and state transition\n―\tControl transfer process and cost\n―\tReaction to uncertainty
    during control transfer\n―\tVerification and validation approaches\n\nThis document
    is applicable to all types of organizations (e.g. commercial enterprises, government
    agencies, not-for-profit organizations) developing and using AI systems during
    their whole life cycle."
