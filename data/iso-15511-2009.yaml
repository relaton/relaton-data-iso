abstract:
- content: "ISO 15511:2009 specifies the International Standard identifier for libraries
    and related organizations (ISIL) which comprises a set of standard identifiers
    used for the unique identification of libraries, archives, museums and related
    organizations with a minimum impact on already existing systems. \nAn ISIL identifies
    an organization, i.e. a library, an archive, a museum or a related organization,
    or one of its subordinate units, which is responsible for an action or service
    in an informational environment (e.g. creation of machine-readable information).
    It can be used to identify the originator or holder of a resource (e.g. library
    material or collection in an archive). The ISIL is intended for use by libraries,
    archives, museums and agencies doing business or interacting with these organizations
    (e.g. suppliers, publishers, and government institutions). An ISIL identifies
    an organization or one of its subordinate units, throughout its life. In some
    cases, such as when an organization has undergone a significant administrative
    change (e.g. a merger with another organization), particularly one that results
    in a name change, a new ISIL identifier can be allocated. \nSince ISO 15511:2009
    allows the use of existing codes to be incorporated into the ISIL, it is possible
    that a given organization can have more than one ISIL, however, the intent of
    ISO 15511:2009 is to minimize the number of codes. \nAny library, archive, museum
    or related organization, administrative unit or subordinate unit, acting autonomously,
    can be allocated an ISIL. \nAn ISIL is not intended to be used to classify organizations
    or their services and holdings."
