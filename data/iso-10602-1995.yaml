abstract:
- content: Establishes the specifications for photographic films intended for the
    storage of records. Applies specifically to films with a base of safety cellulose
    ester or polyester Äpoly(ethylene terephthalate)Ü having silver-gelatin emulsions,
    processed to produce a black-and-white silver image by negative or full-reversal
    processing. The films that may have ultrasonic or dielectric (induction heated)
    splices are processed by a monobath which includes thiosulfate as the fixing agent
    followed by a conventional wash. Also applies to silver films given a stabilizing
    treatment by partial or full conversion to silver sulfide, silver selenide or
    gold.
