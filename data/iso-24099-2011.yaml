abstract:
- content: "ISO 24099:2011 defines the data structures and protocol(s) used in intelligent
    transport system (ITS) applications for the delivery and update of map-related
    data from Service Centre (SC) to users [(In-vehicle Systems (IVS)]. \nISO 24099:2011
    also specifies the message generation protocols in the Service Centre and the
    message receiving protocols in the In‑vehicle Systems.\nThe map centre specified
    in ISO 24099:2011 represents the supplier of map data and the Service Centre provides
    data and services to user devices. \nThe term protocol as used in ISO 24099:2011
    is a temporal sequence of map-related data interactions between system components
    that implement map-related data delivery and update. The delivery and update of
    map-related data rely on existing communication technology. The protocols associated
    with communication technology, and the other application control protocols and
    non-map-related data, for example images to display independent of the map database
    such as HTML images, are outside the scope of ISO 24099:2011.\nDefinitions of
    security mechanisms and business transaction mechanisms are also outside the scope
    of ISO 24099:2011."
