    This document specifies a method to determine the windborne debris-resistance of windows (including skylights), doors or curtain walling to natural threats characterized by simulated destructive-windstorm events. The test method can also be used on windstorm protective systems for the missile impact tests.
    The test method determines the performance of windows, doors or curtain walling, under conditions representative of events that occur in severe, destructive-windstorm environments using simulated missile impact(s) followed by the application of cyclic test load.
    This document is applicable to the design of an entire window (including skylight), door or curtain walling, and also in case these systems are tested in combination with windstorm protective system assemblies and their installation.
    This document is not applicable to:
    —     exterior garage doors and rolling doors are beyond the scope of this document and this document does not refer to:
    —    bullet;
    —    blast;
    —    flood resistance.
    —     windstorm protective systems when tested alone, i.e. not tested in combination with windows, skylights, doors or curtain walling. When windows, skylights, doors or curtain walling are tested in combination with windstorm protective systems, pass and fail assessment criteria (see Clause 9), only refer to windows, skylights, doors or curtain walling themselves. This document does not define pass or fail criteria for windstorm protective systems.
