    This document specifies the test methods for determination of
    a)       the properties of the rubber material used to manufacture the elastomeric isolators, and
    b)       the characteristics of elastomeric isolators.
    It is applicable to elastomeric isolators used to provide buildings or bridges with protection from earthquake damage. The elastomeric isolators covered consist of alternate elastomeric layers and reinforcing steel plates which are placed between a superstructure and its substructure to provide both flexibility for decoupling structural systems from ground motion, and damping capability to reduce displacement at the isolation interface and the transmission of energy from the ground into the structure at the isolation frequency.
