abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 18014-3:2004 describes time-stamping services producing linked
    tokens, that is, tokens that are cryptographically bound to other tokens produced
    by these time-stamping services. It describes a general model for time-stamping
    services of this type and the basic components used to construct a time-stamping
    service of this type, it defines the data structures and protocols used to interact
    with a time-stamping service of this type, and it describes specific instances
    of such time-stamping services. \nThe usage of linking operations reduces the
    level of trust required in the time-stamping service. The trustworthiness of linked
    tokens depends on the integrity of the linking operations carried out by the time-stamping
    service. The integrity of the linking operations performed by the time-stamping
    service can be verified algorithmically. A time-stamping service producing linked
    tokens may publish values derived from the linking operations into widely available
    media to further bind the issued tokens to widely-witnessed events and provide
    additional assurance of integrity. A time-stamping service producing linked tokens
    may also use aggregation operations to bind multiple token requests together,
    thus providing higher throughput through the use of co-operating processes. Algorithms
    applicable to linking, aggregation and publishing operations are covered."
