    ISO/TS 10303-410 specifies the application module for AP210 electronic assembly interconnect and packaging design.
    The following are within the scope of ISO/TS 10303-410:
    the representation of requirements for, design of, and application of electrical and electrotechnical components, interconnect, and assemblies. Included are capabilities to represent the various requirements and sources levied on these items, as well as constraints arising from manufacturing processes. Network and other analysis of proposed or actual design is supported, as is applications that map from the network listing to the layout. Two dimensional and three dimensional assembly and interconnect design is supported, as is microwave and embedded design.
    - The hierarchical description of the functionality of the electronic assembly or interconnect or devices that are used in an electronic assembly or interconnect;
    - The hierarchical description of the functional objects that are combinations of one or more functional objects;
    - The configuration management of the functional objects that are being developed concurrently;
    - The configuration management of analytical models that are being developed concurrently;
    - The explicit interface to analytic models that are used to define the behaviour of a functional object, a device, a physical object, an electronic assembly, or an interconnect;
