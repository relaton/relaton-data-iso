    ISO 18629-12:2005 provides a representation of the concepts that belong to the outer core of the language, through a set of axioms and definitions. These axioms provide an axiomatization of the semantics for terminology in the ISO 18629 Outer core.
    The following are within the scope of ISO 18629-12:2005:
    - the aggregation of activities and sub-activities;
    - discrete activities and state;
    - constraints on the occurrence of activities;
    - concurrency for primitive activities;
    - complex activities;
    - occurrences of complex activities.
