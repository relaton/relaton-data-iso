abstract:
- content: This document recommends and describes a transparent method and range of
    values for classifying and comparing forms of graphene-related 2D materials (GR2M)
    regardless of production method or feedstock materials. This document also provides
    the basis for material technical data sheets which provide a framework which can
    be used equally by producers, users, and regulators. The described technical data
    sheets contain an agreed upon minimum set of relevant material characteristics,
    properties, and identified recommended methods for testing, that have been deemed
    most relevant for the commercial application of GR2M. This document also establishes
    a syntax to be used for the consistent naming and description for GR2M.
