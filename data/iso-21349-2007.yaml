    ISO 21349:2007 provides process requirements for project reviews as a set of required functions. The requirements and recommendations cover the function inputs, outputs, mechanisms, and controlling conditions. It is intended for use in implementing the review requirements of ISO 14300-1, ISO 14300-2, ISO 15865, and such other space systems and operations standards that require formal reviews.
    ISO 21349:2007 specifies the responsibilities of a review board and gives guidance concerning review board composition.
    ISO 21349:2007 is applicable to reviews for a project at any level within a larger project, as well as for major milestone reviews at the top level of a major project. It is intended to be used either by an independent developer as a basis for enterprise processes, or as a basis for an agreement between a supplier and a customer.
    ISO 21349:2007 also provides normative descriptions of the kinds of reviews that are commonly useful in assuring the success of a space project.
