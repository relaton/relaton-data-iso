  content: "This document provides requirements and recommendations to laboratories
    that perform genetically modified organism (GMO) analyses in cottonseed, leaf,
    cotton fibre and cotton fibre-derived materials.\nThe following are within the
    scope of this document:\na)    identifying the materials to be assessed, based
    on the probability of obtaining good quality, fit for purpose DNA from the materials
    in subsequent steps in the cotton cloth production process;\nb)    specifying
    a method for efficient DNA isolation from cotton and cotton-derived materials
    described under point a);\nc)    specifying the cotton-specific method(s) to be
    used as control for amplifiable DNA;\nd)    specifying the screening procedure
    that provides optimal chances to detect GMOs as a result of the performance of
    the lowest number of genetically modified (GM) element screening assays. \nNOTE
    1    The protocol allows for the screening of all currently known GM cotton events
    and is set up in a way that optimizes the probability of also detecting unknown
    GM cotton events that possibly contain similar DNA sequences. Further information
    is given in CEN/TS 16707.\nSampling is outside of the scope of this document.
    \nNOTE 2    A recommended sampling method is given in ISO 6497. General guidance
    for the sampling of bulk materials or for cotton-based products is available in
    standards such as ASTM D1441‑12 and CEN/TS 15568."
