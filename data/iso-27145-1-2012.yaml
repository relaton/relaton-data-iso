    This part of ISO 27145 provides an overview of the structure and the partitioning of the different parts of
    ISO 27145 and shows the relationship between the parts. In addition, it outlines the use case scenarios where
    the ISO 27145 series is used. All terminology that is common throughout the ISO 27145 series is also outlined.
    ISO 27145 is intended to become the single communication standard for access to OBD-related information. To
    allow for a smooth migration from the existing communication standards to this future world-wide communication
    standard, the initial communication concept is based on the ISO 15765 series, i.e. Diagnostic communication
    over Control Area Network (DoCAN).
    The intention is for the future communication concept to be based on the ISO 13400 series, i.e. Diagnostic
    communication over Internet Protocol (DoIP) utilizing Ethernet. In view of the usage of standard network layer
    protocols, future extensions to optional physical layers (e.g. wireless) are possible.
    ISO 27145 has been extended to define the world-wide harmonized On-Board Diagnostics (OBD) communication
    standard. Based on the results of the initialization, the external test equipment determines which protocol and
    diagnostic services are supported by the vehicle's emissions-related system, i.e.
    — legislated OBD: ISO 15031 series (based on DoCAN), and
    — legislated WWH-OBD: ISO 27145 series (based on DoCAN and DoIP).
    IMPORTANT — Use cases deriving from country-specific implementation of Global
