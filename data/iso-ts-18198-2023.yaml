  content: "This document specifies methods of deriving reduction factors for geosynthetic
    drainage materials to account for intrusion of filter geotextiles, compression
    creep, and chemical and biological degradation. It is intended to provide a link
    between the test data and the codes for design with geosynthetic drains.\nThe
    geosynthetics covered include those whose primary purpose is planar drainage,
    such as geonets, cuspated cores only, or cuspated cores combined with laminated
    filter geotextiles, and drainage liners, where the drainage core is made from
    polypropylene and high-density polyethylene. The majority of geosynthetic drains
    are geocomposites with geotextiles laminated to a drainage core and it is important,
    where possible, to consider the drainage behaviour of the geocomposite as a whole
    rather than the behaviour of the component parts in isolation. \nThis document
    does not cover the strength of overlaps or joints between geosynthetic drains
    nor whether these might be more or less durable than the basic material. It does
    not apply to geomembranes, for example, in landfills. It does not cover the effects
    of dynamic loading nor any change in mechanical properties due to soil temperatures
    below 0 °C, or the effects of frozen soil. This document does not cover uncertainty
    in the design of the drainage structures, nor the human or economic consequences
    of failure. Design guidance for geosynthetic drains is found in ISO/TR 18228-4."
