  content: Specifies two methods of checking the measuring equipment and gauging tools
    necessary for measuring the peripheral length (or nip or crush) of thin-walled
    half-bearings that are flexible and, in the free condition, do not conform to
    a cylindrical profile. Method A is based on applying the checking load via the
    measuring head to one joint face, method B on applying two (different) checking
    loads via the measuring head to both joint faces. Annexes A to D deal with the
    determination of the correction factors, Annex E describes tests and calculation
    of repeatability, reproducibility and comparability.
