  content: "ISO 19905-1:2012 specifies requirements and guidance for the site-specific
    assessment of independent leg jack‑up units for use in the petroleum and natural
    gas industries. It addresses\nTo ensure acceptable reliability, the provisions
    of ISO 19905-1:2012 form an integrated approach, which is used in its entirety
    for the site-specific assessment of a jack‑up.\nISO 19905-1:2012 does not apply
    specifically to mobile offshore drilling units operating in regions subject to
    sea ice and icebergs. When assessing a jack-up operating in such areas, it is
    intended that the assessor supplement the provisions of ISO 19905-1:2012 with
    the provisions relating to ice actions and procedures for ice management contained
    in ISO 19906. \nISO 19905-1:2012 does not address design, transportation to and
    from site, or installation and removal from site. However, it is advisable that
    the assumptions used in the assessment be checked against the as-installed configuration.\nTo
    ensure that the design of the jack‑up is sound and the structure is adequately
    maintained, ISO 19905-1:2012 is applicable only to independent leg jack‑ups that
    either:\n-        hold a valid classification society certification from a recognized
    classification society (RCS) throughout the duration of the operation at the specific
    site subject to assessment, or  \n-        have been verified by an independent
    competent body to be structurally fit for purpose for elevated situations and
    are subject to periodic inspection, both to the standards of an RCS. \nJack‑ups
    that do not comply with this requirement are assessed according to the provisions
    of ISO 19902, supplemented by methodologies from ISO 19905-1:2012, where applicable."
