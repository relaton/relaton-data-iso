    ISO 18604:2013 specifies the requirements for packaging to be classified as recoverable in the form of material recycling while accommodating the continuing development of both packaging and recovery technologies and sets out procedures for assessment of meeting its requirements.
    ISO 18604:2013 cannot by itself provide presumption of meeting its requirements. The procedure for applying ISO 18604:2013 is contained in ISO 18601.
