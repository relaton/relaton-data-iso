abstract:
- content: 'IEC 61400-4:2025 is applicable to enclosed speed increasing gearboxes
    for horizontal axis wind turbine drivetrains with a power rating in excess of
    500 kW. This document applies to newly designed gearboxes for wind turbines installed
    onshore or offshore. The technical requirements given in this document are not
    intended for repaired or refurbished gearboxes, or for the extension of the service
    life beyond the design life. This document provides requirements and guidance
    on the analysis of the wind turbine loads in relation to the design of the gear
    and gearbox elements. The gearing elements covered by this document include such
    gears as spur, helical or double helical and their combinations in parallel and
    epicyclic arrangements in the main power path. This document does not apply to
    power take off (PTO) gears. This document includes requirements, design recommendations,
    and rating of gearboxes with rolling bearings, plain bearings, or combinations
    of both bearing types. This document is supported by two Technical Reports: IEC
    TR 61400‑4‑2 provides additional information on lubrication of wind turbine drivetrains
    and IEC TR 61400‑4‑3 contains explanatory notes and supportive information to
    the requirements specified in this document. It is published as a double logo
    standard. This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published
    in 2012. This edition includes the following significant technical changes with
    respect to the previous edition: - extension of the scope to wind turbines above
    2 MW reference power; - considerations for converging differing approaches to
    reliability in gear, bearing and wind turbine standards; - new clause on wind
    turbine loads specific to drivetrains; - revised clause on verification and validation;
    - new clause on design requirements for plain bearings; - revised and expanded
    design considerations for rolling bearings; - revised clause on considerations
    and requirements in the design and analysis of gearbox structural elements; -
    updated considerations and requirements on lubricants and lubrication systems;
    - removal of requirements for documenting the compliance of a design with the
    requirements of the document in favour of reference to IECRE OD‑501‑2.'
