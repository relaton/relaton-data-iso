  content: Specifies methods for measuring sealing devices having more than one seal
    in the set. Specifies methods for measuring stack height in order to determine
    that the sets are to an acceptable dimensional standard. Does not specify the
    dimensions for packing sets or their components. Describes three acceptable methods,
    and figure 1 shows a typical measuring device for the methods 1 and 2, the figures
    3 and 4 show a typical setup for the methods 2 and 3, and figure 2 shows a typical
    device for the method 2.
