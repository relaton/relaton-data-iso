    This Standard specifies the standard test method useful to assess the performance of dust collection systems utilizing integrated fans (compact type dust collector), which shall be applied with or without flow control.
    This standard is not intended to offer the superiority or inferiority of performance between dust collectors, but specifies a standard test method that provides users with performance under simulated conditions of use for a certain duration.
