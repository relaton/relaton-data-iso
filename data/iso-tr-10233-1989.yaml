  content: 'Specifies recommended levels of performance for pallets tested in accordance
    with ISO 8611. The performance levels relate to two grades of pallets: - Grade
    N ("normal") is a minimum requirement suitable for a large number of pallets;
    grade S ("special") is a minimum requirement suitable for a large number of pallets,
    for example two-way pallets, partially four-way pallets. Annex A gives a tabular
    summary of the recommended performance levels in relation to test specified in
    ISO 8611.'
