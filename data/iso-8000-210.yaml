    by sensors as a stream of single, discrete digital values by sensors.\n\nThe following
    are within the scope of this deliverable:\n—\tapplication of quality characteristics
    of sensor data that is a stream of single, discrete digital values;\n—\ttypes
    of anomalies in sensor data;\n—\tquality characteristics of sensor data;\n—\trelationship
    with other ISO standards.\n\nThe following are outside the scope of this deliverable:\n—\tanalogue,
    image, video and sound data produced by sensors;\n—\tmethods to measure data quality
    characteristics."
