  content: This part of ISO 20022 is prepared to complement the ISO 20022 Metamodel,
    as specified in ISO 20022-1, with the generic requirements and rules to define
    specific syntax generation rules such as Part 4 XML Schema generation to be applied
    by the ISO 20022 Registration Authority in order to produce schemas based on each
    specific syntax generation rules in compliance with this part. Such specific syntaxes
    include XML, ASN.1, JSON and whatever which will emerge in the future. Note that
    this part is NOT a set of specific syntax generation rules, BUT a set of “meta
    rules” (in other words guidelines) to define a set of specific syntax generation
    rules such as Part 4 XML Schema generation.
