    ISO 26865:2009 applies to commercial vehicles of the categories M2, M3, N2, N3, O3 and O4, as defined in UNECE R.E.3, which are equipped with air brakes.
    ISO 26865:2009 applies during product development, product prototypes, product specification or validation, and ongoing series production, as defined in ISO 15484.
    When used in conjunction with other applicable standards or test procedures, ISO 26865:2009 is intended to provide a complete assessment of a friction material's adequacy for use in a certain application, market or vehicle platform.
    ISO 26865:2009 does not include performance requirements related to stopping distance or braking force distribution, under different vehicle conditions of speed, temperature, tyre-to-road adhesion, loads and operating conditions of the braking system, as indicated in Federal Codes or Regulations.
    ISO 26865:2009 specifies a single-ended inertia-dynamometer performance procedure, which is intended to standardize the various procedures for commercial vehicles equipped with air brakes into one unique procedure covering all performance requirements of interest.
    The test sequence includes performance evaluation for the following conditions:
    -        performance test before and after bedding;
    -        brake fade after bedding and after moderate temperature;
    -        sensitivity to temperature, speed and pressure influence;
    -        downhill simulation;
    -        brake recovery.
