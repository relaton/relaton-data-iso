  content: "The purpose of this document is to provide guidance for developers of
    visual external communication systems for automated vehicles (AV), particularly
    Automated Driving System ? Dedicated Vehicles (ADS-DV), as defined by SAE J3016.
    \nThe main objective of this document is to propose how ADS-DVs could communicate
    with other road users via an external communication system. It discusses the interaction
    between humans and ADS-DVs within roadway environments. Recommendations for the
    type of external visual communication messaging are presented along with the supporting
    methodological rationale. \nThis document does not address functionality elements
    of the ADS-DV external visual communication system itself. Rather, it serves to
    propose how the system communicates to human users such that it can be learned
    and understood by society at large."
