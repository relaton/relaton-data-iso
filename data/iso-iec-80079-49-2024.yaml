abstract:
- content: 'This document specifies the requirements for flame arresters that prevent
    flame transmission when explosive gas-air or vapour-air mixtures are present.
    It establishes uniform principles for the classification, basic construction and
    information for use, including the marking of flame arresters, and specifies test
    methods to verify the safety requirements and determine safe limits of use. This
    document is applicable to pressures ranging from 80 kPa to 160 kPa and temperatures
    ranging from -20 °C to +200 °C. This document does not apply to the following:
    - external safety-related measurement and control equipment that might be required
    to keep the operational conditions within the established safe limits; - flame
    arresters used for explosive mixtures of vapours and gases, which tend to self-decompose
    (for example, acetylene) or which are chemically unstable; - flame arresters used
    for carbon disulfide, due to its special properties; - flame arresters whose intended
    use is for mixtures other than gas-air or vapour-air mixtures (for example, higher
    oxygen-nitrogen ratio, chlorine as oxidant); - flame arrester test procedures
    for reciprocating internal combustion engines; - fast acting valves, extinguishing
    systems and other explosion isolating systems; - Flame arresters used in gas detectors
    (those being covered for example, by IEC 60079‑29‑1 and IEC 62990‑1). This edition
    cancels and replaces ISO 16852:2016, which has been technically revised. This
    edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to ISO 16852:2016: a) adaptation of
    the relevant IEC TC 31 requirements on standards; b) modification of the upper
    limit of the temperature range from 150 °C to 200 °C under the condition that
    T0 shall be not larger than 80 % of the auto ignition temperature of the gas-air-mixture;
    c) change of the term "explosion group" to "equipment group" due to editorial
    requirements in IEC/TC 31; d) clarification of the conditions and requirements
    for flame arresters whose intended operating conditions are outside the atmospheric
    conditions in 7.3.4 and 7.3.5; e) clarification of the requirements on the information
    for use in Clause 12 f) concerning the burn time; f) addition of a permission
    to the construction requirements both in 7.1 and 14.1 to substitute visual inspection
    by performing a flow test; g) addition of a flow chart for the evaluation of test
    results as Annex D'
