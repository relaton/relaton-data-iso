  content: "This 3 part standard specifies the requirements for the training of scientific
    divers at 3 levels. The standard shall be limited in its scope so as to be applicable
    to all disciplines of science. \n\nScientific Diver - Is capable of diving for
    scientific purposes under the supervision of an Advanced Scientific Diver and
    under the overall oversight of a Scientific Project Leader. \n\nAdvanced Scientific
    Diver - An individual with specific technical or academic skills capable of diving
    for scientific purposes.\n\nScientific Diving Project Leader - Is capable of overseeing
    the conduct of a scientific diving project.\n\nEach standard will specify Competencies,
    Prerequisites for training, Introductory information, Required theoretical knowledge,
    Required practical skills, Practical training parameters and Evaluation criteria
    for training systems aimed at training Scientific Divers, Advanced Scientific
    Divers and Scientific Diving Project Leaders. It is envisaged that each part of
    this three part standard will be a stand-alone deliverable (similar to ISO 24801
    parts one, two and three)."
