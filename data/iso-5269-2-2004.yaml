    ISO 5269-2:2004 specifies a method, using a Rapid-Köthen sheet former, for the preparation of laboratory sheets of pulp for the purpose of carrying out subsequent physical tests on these sheets in order to assess the relevant properties of the pulp itself.
    ISO 5269-2:2004 is applicable to most kinds of pulp. It is not suitable for some pulps with very long fibres, such as those made from unshortened cotton, flax and similar materials.
    This method is not suitable for the preparation of laboratory sheets for the determination of diffuse blue reflectance factor (ISO brightness) in accordance with ISO 3688.
