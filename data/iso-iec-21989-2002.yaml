abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 21989:2002 specifies the Short Message Service (SMS).\nSMS enables
    a user to send and receive Short Messages (SMs) to and from another user.\nThis
    service is based on GSM 03.40. The Service Centre functionality described in ISO/IEC
    21989:2002 is equal to the functionality of a Service Centre in GSM 03.40. Thus,
    for interoperability with a GSM network, it is only necessary to implement a QSIG
    interface.\nNOTE 1 The interworking with other air interfaces is not precluded,
    but is outside the scope of this International Standard.\nNOTE 2 The Short Message
    Service is a special kind of basic service but is described in this document in
    the style of a supplementary service.\nSupplementary service specifications are
    produced in three stages, according to the method described in ETS 300 387. ISO/IEC
    21989:2002 contains the stage 1 and stage 2 specifications of SMS. The stage 1
    specification specifies the service as seen by users of PISNs. The stage 2 specification
    identifies the functional entities involved in the service and the information
    flows between them. "
