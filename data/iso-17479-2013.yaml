    ISO 17479:2013 specifies methods for the direct measurement of the concentration of gaseous exhaust emissions from motorcycles as defined in ISO 3833 during inspection or maintenance. The results measured by this International Standard show the concentration of gaseous exhaust emissions in the no-load engine operating condition. It is applicable to motorcycles having spark ignition engines (four-stroke engines or two-stroke engines). This methods can be used, either totally or partially, for
    a) periodic inspections in official garages,
    b) official roadside checks, and
    c) maintenance and diagnostic operations.
