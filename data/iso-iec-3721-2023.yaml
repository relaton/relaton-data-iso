    This document specifies the information model for representing the mixed and augmented reality (MAR) scene/contents description, namely, information constructs for:
    a)       representing the virtual reality scene graph and structure such that a comprehensive range of mixed and augmented reality contents can also be represented;
    b)       representing physical objects in the mixed and augmented reality scene targeted for augmentation;
    c)        representing physical objects as augmentation to other (virtual or physical) objects in the mixed and augmented reality scene;
    d)       providing ways to spatially associate aforementioned physical objects with the corresponding target objects (virtual or physical) in the mixed and augmented reality scene;
    e)       providing other necessary functionalities and abstractions that will support the dynamic MAR scene description such as event/data mapping, and dynamic augmentation behaviours;
    f)         describing the association between these constructs and the MAR system which is responsible for taking and interpreting this information model and rendering/presenting it out through the MAR display device.
