    This document gives information and guidance on the evaluation and assessment of hand-transmitted shock. For the purposes of this document, isolated shock is any impactive or impulsive vibration that the machine or tool user experiences as a sequence of individual events (single shocks) linked by periods of no, or low vibration.
    This document provides guidance on the identification, measurement, evaluation and possible health effects of hand-transmitted shock vibrations containing vibration energy up to the frequency range covered by ISO 5349-1 (approximately 6,3 Hz to 1 250 Hz).

    Note: It is recognised that shock vibration often includes substantial levels of high-frequency vibration energy. The measured peak values of HTS are likely to be higher if the upper frequency limit is increased. High-frequency shocks, composed of vibrations at frequencies greater than 1 250 Hz, are dealt with in Draft ISO/DTS 5349-4.
