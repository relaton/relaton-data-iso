    This document specifies the requirements for medium tolerance sling chains of grade 4 from stainless steel for use preferably in chain slings of grade 4 from stainless steel or for other lifting purposes.
    The range of nominal diameter, dn, covered by this document is from 4 mm to 22 mm.
    These sling chains are round steel short link chains with a nominal pitch, pn = 3 × dn, electrically welded, solution-annealed and tested. They are for use in the temperature range ?100 °C to +400 °C. They comply with the general conditions of acceptance of ISO 1834.
    NOTE 1    Because sling chains are solution-annealed in the finished condition, they can be used without restrictions with regard to the corrosion resistance of the steels according to 5.2. Higher grades of stainless steel chains are achieved by cold drawing of the wire prior to the chain manufacturing. Therefore, solution annealing is not possible without reduction of strength. The weld seam, in particular, represents a critical area with regard to the corrosion resistance.
    NOTE 2    Resistance butt welding and flash welding are listed in ISO 4063.
