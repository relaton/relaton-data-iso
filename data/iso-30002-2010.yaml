    ISO 30002:2010 provides guidance to shipowners in the selection of a ship recycling facility.
    In order to ensure as far as possible that vessels are recycled in a safe and environmentally sound manner, shipowners need to consider  to which ship recycling facilities they wish to sell their ships, and it is therefore important that ship recycling facilities provide certain objective information to assist in this selection process. Ship recycling facilities that are unwilling to provide this information on request by the shipowner cannot be objectively assessed.
    Since the shipowner might not be able to verify the information given, it is the sole responsibility of the ship recycling facilities to ensure that such information is correct. However, it is important that shipowners be critical in their consideration of any such information, and aware that some facilities might publish obviously false information or give contradictory data that make it apparent that the information supplied does not reflect reality. In such cases the facilities cannot be objectively assessed.
    It applies to the process of selecting a ship recycling facility and the use of a pro forma contract. It does not consider other aspects of ship recycling which are covered by other standards of the ISO 30000 series.
    ISO 30002:2010 is applicable to shipowners who wish
    ISO 30002:2010 does not limit shipowners to selling to or recycling at facilities that have ISO 30000 certification.
