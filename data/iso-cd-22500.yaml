abstract:
- content: This document describes the magnetic flux leakage (MFL) testing method
    and evaluation of results for in-use equipment made of ferromagnetic materials.
    It is mainly used for the detection of volume defects such as corrosion and mechanical
    damage on the inner and outer surfaces of plate and tubular structures. A certain
    thickness of coating is allowed on the detection surface. This document applies
    to external MFL testing of in-use ferromagnetic seamless steel pipes and base
    metal of pressure vessel shells with an outer diameter of not less than 38mm and
    a wall thickness of not more than 20mm. It is also applicable to MFL testing of
    base metal of pressure vessels and storage tank bottom plates from the inside.
