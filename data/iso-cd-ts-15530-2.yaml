  content: "This document describes a procedure for the evaluation of the uncertainty
    of measurements with coordinate measuring machines (CMMs). The method described
    in this document uses multiple measurement strategies (multiple artefact orientations
    and repetitions), the measurement of standards of length and the measurement of
    standards for probe qualification error assessment. The task-specific measurement
    uncertainty is evaluated based on analysis of variance (ANOVA).\n\nThis document
    is applicable to the conformity verification of products against their geometrical
    specifications in accordance with ISO 14253-1 or ISO/TR 14253-6. It is also applicable
    to the calibration of the geometrical properties of workpieces with the special
    consideration described in Clause 8.3. \n\nThis document is also applicable to
    the task which needs the estimation or upper bounding of the task-specific measurement
    uncertainty, e.g. PUMA method in ISO 14253-2.\n\nAlthough this document has been
    prepared for measurements using CMMs equipped with tactile probing systems, it
    could be as well applicable to other coordinate measuring systems (CMSs). \n\nNote
    \tWhen applying this document to other types of CMSs, the testers should carefully
    consider the difference of the kinematic model and measurement error propagation
    between those of Cartesian CMMs and those of the systems to be used."
