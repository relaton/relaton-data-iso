  content: "ISO 18911:2010 provides recommendations concerning the storage conditions,
    storage facilities, handling and inspection for all processed safety photographic
    films in roll, strip, aperture‑card or sheet format, regardless of size. \nISO
    18911:2010 is applicable to extended‑term and medium‑term storage of photographic
    film.\nISO 18911:2010 is applicable to photographic film records intended as storage
    copies, which are not in frequent use. It does not apply to “work” or “use” copies.
    \nISO 18911:2010, while intended for materials that are properly processed, is
    also of considerable value in prolonging the useful life of photographic film
    whose processing conditions are unknown, or which has been toned or retouched,
    or has markings with materials of uncertain or unknown stability. \nISO 18911:2010
    is applicable only to safety photographic film (see ISO 18906). Nitrate-base films
    are not covered by ISO 18911:2010.\nThe storage of photographic prints and photographic
    plates requires different considerations. They are not covered in ISO 18911:2010,
    but are described respectively in ISO 18920 and ISO 18918."
