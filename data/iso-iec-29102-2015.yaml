    ISO/IEC 29102:2015 is to provide a method to determine the ink cartridge photo yield of ink-containing cartridges (i.e. integrated ink cartridges and ink cartridges without integrated printheads) for colour photo printing with colour inkjet printers and multifunction devices that contain inkjet printer components. In the case where a cartridge set can be used in multiple printer models, only one yield test needs to be performed as long as the difference between printer models does not impact yield.
    NOTE          A cartridge supplier may choose to use more than one market identifier for a single physical cartridge.  In this case only one yield test is required as long as there are no differences in the cartridges other than market identifiers.
    ISO/IEC 29102:2015 prescribes the following:
    -      the test method that manufacturers, test laboratories, etc. use to determine ink cartridge photo yield;
    -      the method for determination of declared photo yield values from the test results; and
    -      the appropriate method of describing the photo yield of cartridges in documentation supplied to the consumer by the manufacturer.
    ISO/IEC 29102:2015 is only intended for the determination of ink cartridge photo yield. No other claims can be made from this testing regarding quality, reliability, etc.
    ISO/IEC 29102:2015 can be used to determine the yield of any cartridge that is used during the printing of the photo test file defined in ISO/IEC 29103.
    ISO/IEC 29102:2015 is not for use with printers whose minimum printable size is equal to or greater than A3. This International Standard is not intended to measure the yield of photo printing on paper size larger than 4×6, L or A6. In addition, this International Standard is not for use with industrial printers or point of sale printers. It only applies to desktop printing systems.
