    This part of ISO 8066 specifies the requirements for rubber or thermoplastic hoses and hose assemblies used for
    circulating liquid and gaseous R134a (tetrafluoroethane) in the air-conditioning systems of automobiles. The hoses
    and hose assemblies are designed in such a way as to restrict losses of refrigerant and contamination of the
    system. The operational temperature range is _ 40 °C to +125 °C.
    Due to the critical relationship between the hose and coupling for this application, a requirement that the coupling
    to be used in service be used for testing is laid down.
