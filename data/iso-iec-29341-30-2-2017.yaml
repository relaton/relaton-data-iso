    ISO/IEC 29341-30-2:2017 defines the device for IOT Management and Control, which identifies Level 1 of the device named IOT Management and Control. This Publicly Available Specification is applicable to Standardized DCPs of the UPnP Forum which include this device.
    This device definition is compliant with the UPnP Device Architecture version 1.0 [1]. It defines a device type referred to herein as IOT Management and Control device.
    This specification defines a general-purpose device that can be used to instantiate a bridge or gateway device that is connected to Sensors and Actuators. This device implements a bridge between the UPnP network and Sensors/Actuators endpoints. It exposes services to check the status, and send and receive data from Sensors. Sensors/Actuators may be connected using a variety of transport protocols including Bluetooth, ZigBee and IEEE 11073.
