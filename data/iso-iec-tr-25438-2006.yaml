  content: The CLI standard libraries (ISO/IEC 23271) provide a collection of common
    types that can be used by multiple languages. With the addition of generics to
    the CLI, the standard libraries have been extended to include a number of common
    generic types, in particular, collections. However, at present, these libraries
    do not include many simple generic types found in a number of different languages.
    Any language which uses these common types must implement them rather than deferring
    to the CLI library, thereby reducing language inter-operability. ISO/IEC TR 25438:2006
    addresses this issue by providing a number of these common types.
