abstract:
- content: "ISO 16612-2:2010 defines the PDF/VT document format and methods to enable
    reliable document exchange for variable data and transactional (VT) printing.
    It uses the Portable Document Format (PDF) Version 1.6, as restricted by PDF/X-4
    and PDF/X-5, for the representation of such documents. It allows the specification
    of document structure and layout, content data, and interaction of graphical objects
    in a graphics model that supports transparency and both device-dependent and device-independent
    colour spaces. All elements either are included or provision is made for unique
    identification of externally supplied graphical content or ICC profiles. \nPDF/VT
    is designed to enable variable data and transactional printing in a variety of
    environments from desktop printers to digital production presses. This includes
    hybrid workflows involving both conventional and digital printing.\nISO 16612-2:2010
    does not provide for the specification and encoding of production and device control
    information but is constructed to enable its use with the International Cooperation
    for the Integration of Processes in Prepress, Press, and Postpress Organization
    (CIP4) job document format (JDF) or similar job ticket formats."
