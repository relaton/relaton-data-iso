  content: Specifies a method for assessing the changes in dimensions, shape and flexibility
    of leather upon application of heat, where such leather is intended for the manufacture
    of industrial gloves. The principle of the method is heating a test specimen in
    an oven and assessing any shrinkage, as well as any change in shape or flexibility.
    The method is applicable to both finished and unfinished leathers and can also
    be used for other items of protective clothing.
