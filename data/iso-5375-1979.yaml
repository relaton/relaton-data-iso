  content: Applicable to products having contents, expressed in nitrogen, of 2 mg/kg
    or more. Oxidation of nitrogen(III) of a test portion to nitrogen(V) by potassium
    permanganate. Reaction of nitrogen(V) with 3,4-xylenol under specified conditions
    to form a nitrate derivative. Distillation of the nitrate derivative and absorption
    in a sodium hydroxide solution. Spectrophotometric measurement of the yellow coloured
    nitrophenol at a wavelength of about 435 nm. Has also been approved by the IUPAC.
