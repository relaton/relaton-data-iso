  script: Latn
  content: Fibre Channel provides a general data transport vehicle for Upper Level
    Protocols (ULPs) such as Intelligent Peripheral Interface (IPI) and Small Computer
    System Interface (SCSI) command sets, the High-Performance Parallel Interface
    (HIPPI) data framing, IP (Internet Protocol), ANSI/IEEE 802.2, and others. This
    international standard, FC-AL-2, specifies an enhancement to the signaling protocol
    of the Fibre Channel Physical and Signalling Interface (FC-PH), ISO/IEC 14165-111,
    to support communication among two or more Ports without using the Fabric topology.
    It defines L_Ports that retain the functionality of Ports as specified in FC-PH.
    The Arbitrated Loop topology attaches multiple communicating points in a loop
    without requiring switches; it is a distributed topology where each L_Port includes
    the minimum necessary function to establish a Loop circuit. A single FL_Port connected
    to an Arbitrated Loop allows multiple NL_Ports to attach to a Fabric. Each L_Port
    may use a self-discovering procedure to find the correct operating mode without
    the need for external controls.
