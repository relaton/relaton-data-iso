    ISO 19079:2016 describes the networking protocol functionality related to 6LoWPAN networking between two or more ITS stations communicating over the global Internet communication network.
    It is assumed that the reader is familiar with IETF specifications found in "Request for Comments" (RFCs) 4944, 6282 and 2460 for 6LoWPAN and IPv6 protocols respective blocks used within this document. This document does not define a new protocol, neither does it define new abstraction for exchange of messages at the 6LoWPAN layer nor does it define new data structures. It, however, illustrates how the IETF protocols are combined to allow seamless communication among both heterogeneous and homogeneous ITS stations using 6LoWPAN. The 6LoWPAN family of protocols defined in this document as the Internet of Things Management Service Entity (IoT MSE) is integrated within the ITS station reference architecture as a new protocol block of the ITS station Networking and Transport layer. The procedures defined to share information between the IoT MSE block of the ITS station networking and transport protocols and other components of the ITS station architecture will be defined in the ISO 24102 series. ISO 24102 series includes the specifications for ITS station management, which are standardized to be compliant with the ITS station reference architecture and related standards.
    In addition to the requirements described within this document, a number of notes and examples are provided to illustrate the IoT MSE block and its configuration.
