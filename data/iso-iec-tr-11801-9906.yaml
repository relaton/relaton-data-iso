abstract:
- content: 'ISO/IEC TR 11801-9906:2020(E) covers channel specifications, for channels
    constructed from balanced 1 pair cabling components, primarily intended for use
    in industrial automation and process control applications. The channel specifications
    are consistent with corresponding IEEE 802.3 single-pair Ethernet (SPE) applications
    and are referenced from link segment specifications in the following IEEE SPE
    physical layer specifications: • ISO/IEC/IEEE 8802-3:2017/AMD4, 1 000 Mb/s: 1000BASE
    T1 Type A, = 15 m, 1000BASE T1 Type B, = 40 m; • ISO/IEC/IEEE 8802-3:2017/AMD1,
    100 Mb/s: 100BASE T1, = 15 m; • IEEE 802.3cg, 10 Mb/s: 10BASE T1S, = 15 m; 10BASE
    T1L, = 1 000 m. The channel component specifications are referenced according
    to corresponding IEC balanced 1 pair cable and connector specifications. Channel
    specifications include IL, RL, TCL, coupling attenuation, and alien crosstalk
    parameters specifications. Channel EMC related specifications include electromagnetic
    isolation levels E1, E2 and E3, which are defined according to the MICE standard
    environmental characterization system specified in ISO/IEC 11801-1'
