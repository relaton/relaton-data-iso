abstract:
- content: |-
    ISO 22514-2:2017 describes a procedure for the determination of statistics for estimating the quality capability or performance of product and process characteristics. The process results of these quality characteristics are categorized into eight possible distribution types. Calculation formulae for the statistical measures are placed with every distribution.
    The statistical methods described in this document only relate to continuous quality characteristics. They are applicable to processes in any industrial or economical sector.
    NOTE          This method is usually applied in case of a great number of serial process results, but it can also be used for small series (a small number of process results).
