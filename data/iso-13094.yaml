    This document specifies the test method used to determine the strength of the adhesive-bonded carbon fibre reinforced plastics (CFRP) to metal assemblies under combined loading conditions. The loading fixture, a standard specimen, and procedure for combined shear and normal load tests under plane stress conditions are provided. The test method is also applicable to bonded joints between metals and other composite materials, including glass fibre-reinforced plastics.
    This document does not cover specimen preparation of the adhesive joint.
