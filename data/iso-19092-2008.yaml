    ISO 19092:2008 describes the security framework for using biometrics for authentication of individuals in financial services. It introduces the types of biometric technologies and addresses issues concerning their application. ISO 19092:2008 also describes the architectures for implementation, specifies the minimum security requirements for effective management, and provides control objectives and recommendations suitable for use by a professional practitioner.
    The following are within the scope of ISO 19092:2008:
    - usage of biometrics for the authentication of employees and persons seeking financial services by:

    verification of a claimed identity;
    identification of an individual;


    - validation of credentials presented at enrolment to support authentication as required by risk management;
    - management of biometric information across its life cycle comprised of the enrolment, transmission and storage, verification, identification and termination processes;
    - security of biometric information during its life cycle, encompassing data integrity, origin authentication and confidentiality;
    - application of biometrics for logical and physical access control;
    - surveillance to protect the financial institution and its customers;
    - security of the physical hardware used throughout the biometric information life cycle.
    ISO 19092:2008 provides the mandatory means whereby biometric information may be encrypted for data confidentiality or other reasons.
