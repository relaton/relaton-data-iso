    This document specifies test method, test target, and reporting requirements to determine the scratch resistance of prints with photographic images. Photographic images can be produced by a wide range of printing technologies, including silver halide, electrophotography, inkjet, dye diffusion thermal transfer, commonly known as dye sublimation, and dye transfer processes. This document is applicable to prints with paper substrate and other type of substrates including prints on plastic, glass, metal and other materials. This document is applicable to photographic prints that have no protection as well as photographic prints that are protected by a coating or lamination.
    It is not the purpose of this document to define limits of acceptability or failure. They would be determined by the user and the intended application.
