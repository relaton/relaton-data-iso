- content: |-
    This document specifies technical requirements for independent glazed openings on large yachts, taking into account navigation conditions, the location of the opening and the materials, framing and testing.
    Large yachts are yachts with length of the hull, LH, higher or equal to 24 m, used for sport or pleasure and commercial operations.
    This document is suitable for the design of glazed openings on all large yachts. However, where yachts carry more than 12 passengers, the additional requirements (set by the appropriate marine administration) for fire integrity and damage stability are outside the scope of this standard.
    The opening and the associated closing appliances considered in this document are only those that are above the deepest waterline (dsw) and are critical for the ship integrity related to weathertightness and watertightness, i.e. those that can lead to ingress of water in the hull in case of rupture, dislocation or loss of the pane or its mounting. This document is related and limited to independent glazed openings in which the pane is supported solely by simple linear support at the edges. Glazing in which the rotation at the edges is constrained more than it would be by a single bond line is not covered by this document. This document, excluding annexes, is limited to glazing of any shape, which is simply supported along all edges. Horizontally positioned glazing is excluded.
    NOTE       This document is based on the experience of ship window and glass manufacturers, shipbuilders and authorities who apply to ships the regulations of SOLAS, as amended[7], and of the International Convention of Load Lines, as amended[6], noting the provisions by the SOLAS Protocol of 1988, Article 8, as agreed by the appropriate Marine Administration, and on the experience gained with application of the Large Commercial Yacht Code and the REG Yacht Code[16].
