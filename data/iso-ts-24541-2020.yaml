abstract:
- content: "This document specifies guidelines for the implementation of continuous
    monitoring systems for drinking water quality and operational parameters in drinking
    water distribution networks.\nIt provides guidance for determining the:\n—     effective
    number of continuous monitoring stations in the drinking water distribution network;\n—
    \    location of monitoring stations in the drinking water distribution network;\n—
    \    types of operational and drinking water quality parameter measuring devices
    (MDs) that can be installed in a continuous monitoring station; \n—     quality
    control, maintenance and calibration requirements of the continuous monitoring
    system.\nThis document excludes guidance on the design, structure, number and
    type of MDs to be installed in a continuous monitoring system."
