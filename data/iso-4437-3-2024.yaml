    This document specifies the characteristics of fusion fittings made from polyethylene (PE) as well as of mechanical fittings for piping systems in the field of the supply of gaseous fuels.
    It also specifies the test parameters for the test methods referred to in this document.
    In conjunction with ISO 4437-1, ISO 4437-2, ISO 4437-4 and ISO 4437-5, this document is applicable to PE pipes, fittings and valves, their joints, and joints with components of PE and other materials intended to be used under the following conditions:
    a)       a maximum operating pressure (MOP), up to and including 10 bar[1], at a reference temperature of 20 °C for design purposes;
    b)       an operating temperature between −20 °C and 40 °C.
    For operating temperatures between 20 °C and 40 °C, derating coefficients are defined in ISO 4437-5.
    The ISO 4437 series covers a range of maximum operating pressures and gives requirements concerning colours.
    It is the responsibility of the purchaser or specifier to make the appropriate selections from these aspects, taking into account their particular requirements and any relevant national regulations and installation practices or codes.
    This document is applicable for fittings of the following types:
    —     electrofusion socket fittings;
    —     electrofusion saddle fittings;
    —     spigot end fittings (for butt fusion using heated tools and electrofusion socket fusion);
    —     socket fusion fittings;
    —     mechanical fittings.
    NOTE 1        The fittings can be, for example, in the form of couplers, saddles, equal and reduced tees, reducers, elbows, bends or end caps.
    NOTE 2        Fabricated fittings are normally not used for gas applications except for larger dimensions or in the absence of other solutions. Guidance can be found in ISO 4427-3:2019, Annex B.
