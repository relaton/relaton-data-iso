    This document specifies filter functions of uncoated bulk absorption filters for optical applications excluding ophthalmic optics (spectacles) and gives a standard form for their specification. Additionally, basic definitions and a description of the specification concerning optical bulk absorption filters are given.
    This document specifies the optical properties of the filters and the test and measurement methods whenever necessary.
    This document does not specify any material properties (internal quality, homogeneity, etc.) and it does not apply to any production method.
    This document applies to both the raw material (filter glass, filter plastics, etc.) and the polished component.
    NOTE 1   Colorimetric parameters for the description of the filter function are specified in e.g. ISO 11664‑1 and ISO 11664‑2.
    NOTE 2   For filters where the spectral transmission characteristics are achieved by the application of optical coatings, see ISO 9211 series.
    NOTE 3   In the case of high power applications, further optical effects may occur.
