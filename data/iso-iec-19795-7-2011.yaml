    ISO/IEC 19795-7:2011 establishes a mechanism for measuring the core algorithmic capabilities of biometric comparison algorithms running on ISO/IEC 7816 integrated circuit cards. Specifically, ISO/IEC 19795-7:2011
    - instantiates a mechanism for on-card biometric comparison testing;
    - standardizes procedures for the measurement of the accuracy of on-card biometric comparison implementations running on object-based, test-specific sample cards;
    - standardizes procedures for the measurement of durations of the various operations;
    - gives examples for matching ISO/IEC 19794-2:2005 compact card minutiae templates.
    The following are specifically not within the scope of ISO/IEC 19795-7:2011:
    - procedures for securing the communications channel, including cryptographic protection of the biometric templates;
    - procedures for protection of sample or template integrity using digital signatures;
    - authentication of the card and reader;
    - selection or use of transmission protocols (e.g. contactless);
    - profiles of specific data interchange standards;
    - procedures for evaluation of readers, including performance, conformance and interoperability;
    - procedures for evaluation of ruggedness or durability of the card;
    - on-card template generation (e.g. extraction of minutiae from images);
    - template update or adaptation;
    - formal conformance tests of ISO/IEC 7816-4 and ISO/IEC 7816-11;
    - testing of devices not conforming to ISO/IEC 7816, including all system-on-card devices.
