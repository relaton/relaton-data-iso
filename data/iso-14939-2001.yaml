    This International Standard specifies a high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method for the
    determination of the carbadox content in premixtures and animal feeding stuffs.
    The method is applicable to animal feeding stuffs with a mass fraction of carbadox of 0,5 mg/kg (limit of
    quantification) to 100 mg/kg, and to premixtures with a mass fraction of carbadox up to 10 %.
    The lower limit of detection is 0,1 mg/kg.
    NOTE 1 For animal feeding stuffs the mass fraction of carbadox is expressed in milligrams per kilogram, and for premixtures
    as a percentage by mass.
    NOTE 2 Carbadox is a chemotherapeuticum belonging to the quinoxaline group. Carbadox is used as a growth-promoting
    feed additive for piglets.
