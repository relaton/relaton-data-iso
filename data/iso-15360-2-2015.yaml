    ISO 15360-2:2015 specifies a method to estimate Stickies and Plastics in all grades of recycled pulp. It applies the principles for the separation of Stickies and Plastics described in ISO 15360‑1. The visualization and counting techniques described in ISO 15360‑1 are replaced here by image analysis.
    ISO 15360-2:2015 permits the use of different laboratory screening devices as well as screens of different sizes when applying the specified method. It is impracticable to define more closely the equipment or screen sizes to be used, because of the wide range of Stickies and Plastics found in recycled pulps, and the various screening devices which are being successfully used for their measurement.
    NOTE          This method will only estimate those Stickies and Plastics which are tacky and which are retained on the screen of a given slit size under the temperature and pressure conditions of this test method. It is important to note that this will probably not be the total amount of Stickies and Plastics that are actually present in a given pulp sample.
