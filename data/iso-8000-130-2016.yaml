    ISO 8000-130:2016 is an optional addition to ISO 8000‑120 and specifies requirements for representation and exchange of information about accuracy of master data that consists of characteristic data.
    ISO 8000-130:2016 does not specify a complete model for characteristic data, nor does it specify an exchange format for characteristic data with data accuracy information.
    The following are within the scope of ISO 8000-130:2016:
    ·         requirements for capture and exchange of data accuracy information in the form of statements and assertions of data accuracy;
    ·         conceptual data model for data accuracy information in the form of statements and assertions of data accuracy.
    The following are outside the scope of ISO 8000-130:2016:
    ·         requirements for data accuracy;
    ·         exchange format for data accuracy information;
    ·         scheme for registering and resolving organization identifiers and person identifiers;
    ·         accuracy of data that are not characteristic data represented as property values;
    ·         syntax of identifiers;
    ·         resolution of identifiers.
    Some of the requirements in ISO 8000-130:2016 can apply to exchange of data that is not master data which consists of characteristic data represented as property values.
