abstract:
- content: |-
    This document specifies requirements for the ice plug technique with liquid nitrogen or dry ice as refrigerant (cryogenic medium) on metal pipes of nuclear power plants. The freezing liquid can be water or water mixture (e.g. boric acid mixture).
    This document specifies technical requirements of ice plug generation, formation judgment and removal, measures before, during and after ice plugging and requirements for personnel and non-destructive testing.
    The application of the ice plug isolation technique is principally not allowed on cladded pipes or pipes with internal coatings. The application for pressure test is not in the scope of this document and will be qualified separately.
