    This International Standard describes the principles and methods for evaluating the performance of equipment
    used for cleaning operations. Testing and sampling procedures are specified and methods of presenting test
    results are detailed. Performance parameters are recommended and defined and their determination is formulated,
    thereby allowing their use in evaluating, comparing and predicting performance levels of cleaning operations.
    This International Standard is applicable to the following types of coal cleaning equipment using relative density as
    the main characteristic for separation:
    a) dense-medium separators;
    b) jigs;
    c) other separators.
