    This document defines general terms and film growth processes for atomic layer deposition (ALD). ALD technique is classified into conventional time separated ALD and spatial ALD according to the separation between sequential surface reactions of precursors on substrate. Besides planar substrate, ALD can be used for coating on micro-nano particles, which is developed as powder ALD. Some energy enhanced ALD techniques are also included. This document specifies the processes of different ALD methods.
    This document applies to the process of ALD. This document does not apply to the deposited materials or specific nanostructures.
    This document applies to industrial production, scientific research, teaching, publishing and scientific and technological communications related to ALD.
