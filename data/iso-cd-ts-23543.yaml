  content: This document is intended to provide guidance for the application of cybersecurity
    in safety standards for anaesthetic and respiratory equipment. It is intended
    to assist each committee in identifying, assessing, and addressing cybersecurity
    risks, and in the preparation of corresponding requirements in an appropriate
    and consistent way. This document is applicable to particular device standards
    for anaesthetic and respiratory equipment with external (accessible) data interfaces
    (Signal Input/Output Part (SIP/SOP)).
