abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 24775-5:2014(E) defines management profiles for Autonomous (top
    level) profiles for programs and devices whose central function\nis providing
    support and access to file data. In addition, it provides documentation of component
    profiles (or subprofiles) that deal with file systems and management interface
    functions that may be used by other autonomous profiles not included in this part
    of the standard. This International Standard, together with ISO/IEC 24775-1 to
    ISO/IEC 24775-4 and ISO/IEC24775-6 to ISO/IEC 24775-8, replaces ISO/IEC 24775,
    second edition, published in 2011, and constitutes a technical revision. This
    edition includes the following changes:      \n- Improved organisation;\n- Maturity
    indication;  \n- expanded scope."
