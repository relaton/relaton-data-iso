    This document describes methods for checking laser profilometer performance with respect to the capability of such equipment in measuring pavement texture.
    The objective of this document is to make available an internationally accepted procedure by which performance of various laser-based equipment for pavement texture measurements can be evaluated. The document includes guidelines and recommendations intended to assist users of laser profilometers in verification of their equipment. This document is not intended as the basis for qualifying or approving laser profilometers. The procedure aims at providing tools for verifying that such systems perform satisfactory in all respects important for the correct measurements of texture, as well as to detect when and in what way the performance is unsatisfactory. This document also provides some general information about the limitations and trade-offs of laser profilometer systems.
    Modern profilometers in use for measurements on pavements are almost entirely of the contactless type (such as laser point or line triangulation) designed for two- or three-dimensional measurements, and this document is intended for evaluating the performance of this type of profilometers. However, some other contactless types of profilometer can use applicable parts of ISO 13473.
    This document has been prepared as a result of a need identified to correct for unacceptable differences in results measured by various equipment, even if the operators of these claim that they meet the applicable part of ISO 13473. It is not intended for other applications than pavement texture measurement. To be able to exclude errors influenced by programming mistakes or wrong interpretation of ISO 13473‑1 a reference program code, digital profiles and calculated reference MPD-values can be reached via Annex A. This document is a complement to other parts of ISO 13473 in which some specifications are given but methods to check them are not included.
