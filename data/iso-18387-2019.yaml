    This document establishes the general requirements for a linear hydraulic utility actuator, herein referred to as a "utility actuator", for use in flight vehicle hydraulic systems at pressures up to 35 000 kPa (5 000 psi).
    These requirements include:
    —     design requirements;
    —     test requirements.
    This document is intended to be used in conjunction with the detail specification that is particular to each application.
    NOTE    Although Brake pistons and Landing Gear Bogie (Truck) Pitch Trimmers are utility actuators, they are outside the scope of this document. This is because these devices are considered to be specialist actuator devices due to their specific duty cycles requiring a separate set of tailored requirements.
