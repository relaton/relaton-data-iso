    This document specifies product definitions, product characteristics (i.e. tolerances, flatness, edgework), fracture characteristics, including fragmentation, and the physical and mechanical characteristics of flat heat strengthened soda lime silicate glass for use in buildings.
    This document does not cover surface finished glasses (e.g. sandblasted, acid etched) after heat strengthening.
    This document does not cover curved (bent) glass.
    Other requirements, not specified in this document, can apply to heat strengthened soda lime silicate glass which is incorporated into assemblies (e.g. laminated glass or insulating glass units), or undergoes an additional treatment (e.g. coating). The additional requirements are specified in the appropriate glass product standard. Heat strengthened soda lime silicate glass, in this case, does not lose its mechanical or thermal characteristics.
