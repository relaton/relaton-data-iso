  content: "ISO 27145-2:2012 defines all regulatory data elements of the ISO 27145
    series. The data elements are used to provide the external test equipment with
    the diagnostic status of the vehicle on-board diagnostics (VOBD) system in the
    vehicle. All data elements are communicated with the unified diagnostic services
    as defined in ISO 27145-3. The data elements are diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs),
    data identifiers (DIDs) and routine identifiers (RIDs). The mapping from parameter
    identifiers (PIDs), monitor identifiers (MIDs) and info type identifiers (ITIDs)
    is described in ISO 27145-2:2012.\nIf new legislated WWH-OBD GTR modules are established,
    it is intended that ISO 27145 be applicable with possible extensions, which can
    be included in ISO 27145-2:2012, can be specified as enhancements of the SAE Digital
    Annexes or can even be part of other referenced documents which are intended to
    include the applicable data definitions. \nISO 27145 is intended to become the
    single communication standard for access to OBD-related information (VOBD). To
    allow for a smooth migration from the existing communication standards to this
    future world-wide communication standard, the communication concept as specified
    in ISO 27145-4 is based on two different data links: ISO 15765-4 and ISO 13400
    (all parts)."
