    to achieve the security objectives as defined in ISO 23195. The security framework

    of any TPP service, including: \n-\tthe TPP logical structural model,\n-\tthe
    definition of the security framework,\n-\tthe design principles, responsibilities,
    and functional requirements to support the security mechanism,\n-\tguidelines
    for applying security framework defined in this document,\nfor TPP services."
