    ISO 11193-2:2006 specifies requirements for packaged sterile, or bulked non-sterile, poly(vinyl chloride) gloves intended for use in medical examinations, and diagnostic or therapeutic procedures, to protect the patient and the user from cross-contamination. It also covers poly(vinyl chloride) gloves intended for use in handling contaminated medical materials.
    ISO 11193-2:2006 is intended as a reference for the performance and safety of poly(vinyl chloride) examination gloves. The safe and proper usage of examination gloves and sterilization procedures with subsequent handling, packaging and storage procedures are outside the scope of ISO 11193-2:2006.
