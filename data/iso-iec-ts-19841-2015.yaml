    ISO/IEC TS 19841:2015 describes extensions to the C++ Programming Language (1.3) that enable the specification of Transactional Memory. These extensions include new syntactic forms and modifications to existing language and library.
    The International Standard, ISO/IEC 14882, provides important context and specification for this Technical Specification. This document is written as a set of changes against that specification. Instructions to modify or add paragraphs are written as explicit instructions. Modifications made directly to existing text from the International Standard use green to represent added text and strikethrough to represent deleted text.
    ISO/IEC TS 19841:2015 is non-normative. Some of the functionality described by this Technical Specification may be considered for standardization in a future version of C++, but it is not currently part any C++ standard. Some of the functionality in this Technical Specification may never be standardized, and other functionality may standardized in a substantially changed form.
    The goal of this Technical Specification is to build widespread existing practice for Transactional Memory. It gives advice on extensions to those vendors who wish to provide them
