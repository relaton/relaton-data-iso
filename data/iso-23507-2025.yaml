    This document deals with the aspects of a project, in particular the terminology used.  Many of these terms are already used with various definitions within the target communities for this practice, for example, space, science, life sciences, libraries, records management, and archival communities. It is expected that other communities can easily map this terminology to the terminology used within those communities. The Reference Model for an Open Archival Information System (OAIS) provided a starting point and inputs from a variety of other sources were used to arrive at the terms used within this standard.
    This document accomplishes the following:
    –      identifies the Additional Information to be collected or improved at various points;
    –      forms a basis for the specification of Data Management Plans (DMPs);
    –      forms a basis for the identification and/or development of additional standards and implementation guides, including those that address particular concerns in more detail.
