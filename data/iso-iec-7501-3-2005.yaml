    ISO/IEC 7501-3:2005 is a short form endorsement of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Document Doc 9303 Part 3 - Size-1 and Size-2 Machine Readable Official Travel Documents. ICAO Doc 9303 Part 3 specifies generic formats and minimum data elements for visual inspection and machine reading of official travel documents in the ID-1 and ID-2 card formats containing standardized, globally interoperable machine readable optical character recognition (OCR) data, which may at the option of Governments, be accepted in lieu of a passport as defined in Annex 9 (Chapter 3, paragraph 3.4) to the Convention on International Civil Aviation year 1946 (as revised).
    The edition of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Document; i.e. Doc 9303 Part 3 - Size-1 and Size-2 Machine Readable Official Travel Documents, Sections III and IV, Technical Specifications, which was adopted as ISO/IEC 7501-3:1997 is now out of date and in the process of being revised. Once the new edition of Doc 9303 Part 3 - Size-1 and Size-2 Machine Readable Official Travel Documents is finalized by the TAG/MRTD, ISO/IEC JTC 1 will undertake its consideration for endorsement as a new third edition of ISO/IEC 7501-3.
