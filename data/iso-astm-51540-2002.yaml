    ISO/ASTM 51540 covers the preparation, handling, testing and procedure for using radiochromic liquid dosimetry systems of radiochromic dye solutions held in sealed or capped containers (e.g., ampoules, vials). It also covers the use of spectrophotometric or photometric read-out equipment for measuring absorbed doses in materials irradiated by photons and electrons.
    This practice applies to radiochromic liquid dosimeter solutions that can be used within part or all of the specified ranges as follows:
    the absorbed dose range is from 0,5 Gy to 40 000 Gy for photons and electrons;
    the absorbed dose rate is from 10-3 Gy s -1to 1011 Gy s-1;
    the radiation energy range for photons is from 0,01 MeV to 20 MeV;
    the radiation energy range for electrons is from 0,01 MeV to 20 MeV;
    the irradiation temperature range is from - 40 °C to + 60 °C.
