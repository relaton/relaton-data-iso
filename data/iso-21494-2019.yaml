- content: |-
    ISO 21494:2019 specifies magnetic test methods including magnetic field test methods, magnetic moment test methods, magnetization and demagnetization test methods and magnetic compensation test methods. This document is applicable to magnetic tests on several levels: spacecraft-level, subsystem-level and unit-level.
    ISO 21494:2019 gives guidelines for conducting magnetic tests both in zero-magnetic field environment provided by magnetic test facilities and in the presence of the geomagnetic field environment.
