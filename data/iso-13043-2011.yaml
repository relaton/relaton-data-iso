    ISO 13043:2011 is restricted to refrigerant systems providing cooling or heating of passenger compartment, battery, etc., in passenger motor vehicles. It provides minimum design requirements for refrigerant containment and safety requirements of these systems.
    ISO 13043:2011 addresses the use of only R‑134a, R‑1234yf and R‑744 refrigerants in vehicle original equipment manufacturer (OEM) and aftermarket (non-OEM) supplied components and systems.
    The relevant risks associated with these refrigerant systems are:
    - projection of fragments or fluid due to high pressure systems;
    - inhalation of toxic substances, including potential decomposition products;
    - flame propagation.
    Consequently, ISO 13043:2011 will address the component and system design requirements related to any of these hazards where the refrigerant system is involved.
    Any scenario involving other components from the heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system (heater, blower, air mixing and distribution) or any other component of the vehicle not related to the refrigerant system will not be covered in ISO 13043:2011.
    The purpose of ISO 13043:2011 is to ensure that end-users or service technicians are not exposed to hazards during normal usage, maintenance and repair, and end-of-life disposal of the car. Therefore, manufacturing, storage and transportation of the refrigerant, as well as refrigerant distribution and filling machines in the assembly plant will not be covered in ISO 13043:2011. For these situations, the safety of qualified personnel will be addressed by existing standards commonly used among the industry and relevant regulations.
    Entire vehicle lifetime has been considered to address durability issues.
    For the R‑134a system, ISO 13043:2011 applies to any new model type launched one year after the document is published.
    For the R‑1234yf and R‑744 systems, ISO 13043:2011 applies from first application of these refrigerants to any vehicle.
