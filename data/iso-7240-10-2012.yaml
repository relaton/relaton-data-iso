    This part of ISO 7240 specifies requirements, test methods and performance criteria for point-type, resettable flame detectors that operate using radiation from a flame for use in fire detection systems installed in buildings.
    This part of ISO 7240 is not applicable to flame detectors with special characteristics, developed for specific risks. It can be used as guidance in assessing other types of flame detectors not included in this part of ISO 7240.
    The performance of flame detectors is assessed from results obtained in specific tests. This part of ISO 7240 is not intended to place any other restrictions on the design and construction of such flame detectors.
