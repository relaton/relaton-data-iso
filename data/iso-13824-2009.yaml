abstract:
- content: |-
    ISO 13824:2009 specifies general principles on risk assessment of systems involving structures. The focus is on strategic and operational decision-making related to design, assessment, maintenance and decommissioning of structures. This also includes formulation and calibration of related codes and standards. Systems involving structures can expose stakeholders at various levels in society to significant risks. The aim of ISO 13824:2009 is to facilitate and enhance decision-making with regard to monitoring, reducing and managing risks in an efficient, cost-effective and transparent manner. Within the broader context of risk management, risk assessment provides decision makers with procedures to determine whether or not and in what manner it is appropriate to treat risks.
    ISO 13824:2009 provides a general framework as well as a procedure for identifying hazards and estimating, evaluating and treating risks of structures and systems involving structures. ISO 13824:2009 also provides a basis for code writers as well as designers to set reasonable target-reliability levels, such as stated in ISO 2394, based on the result of risk considerations. For existing structures, assessment of the risks associated with the events that were not considered in the original design or with changes in use shall be implemented according to the principles stated in ISO 13824:2009. ISO 13824:2009 can also be used for risk assessment of exceptional structures, the design of which is usually beyond the scope of existing codes.
