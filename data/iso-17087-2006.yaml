abstract:
- content: ISO 17087:2006 specifies performance levels for adhesives to be used in
    finger joints in nonstructural bonded lumber products. Such products include,
    but are not limited to, interior and exterior mouldings, window and door components
    or parts, and bonded lumber panels. Adhesives that meet the requirements of the
    various performance classes are considered capable of providing an adequate bond
    for use under the conditions described for the class. This specification is intended
    to be used to evaluate adhesives as well as the adhesive bonds in the finger joints.
