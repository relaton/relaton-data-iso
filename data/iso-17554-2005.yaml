abstract:
- content: ISO 17554:2005 specifies a small-scale method for assessing the mass loss
    rate of essentially flat specimens exposed in the horizontal orientation to controlled
    levels of radiant heating with an external igniter under well-ventilated conditions.
    The mass loss rate is determined by measurement of the specimen mass and is derived
    numerically. The time to ignition (sustained flaming) is also measured in this
    test. Mass loss rate can be used as an indirect measure of heat release rate for
    many products.
