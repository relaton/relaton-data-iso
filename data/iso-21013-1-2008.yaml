    ISO 21013 specifies the requirements for the design, manufacture and testing of pressure relief valves for cryogenic service, i.e. for operation with cryogenic fluids in addition to operation at temperatures from ambient to cryogenic. It is a requirement of ISO 21013 that the valves comply with ISO 4126-1; in the event of different requirements, ISO 21013 takes precedence.
    ISO 21013 is restricted to valves not exceeding a size of DN 150 designed to relieve single-phase vapours or gases. A valve may be specified, constructed and tested such that it is suitable for use with more than one gas or with mixtures of gases.
    ISO 21013-1:2008 does not provide methods for determining the capacity of relief valve(s) for a particular cryogenic vessel. Such methods are provided in ISO 21013-3.
