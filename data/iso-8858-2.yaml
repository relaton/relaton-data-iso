- content: |-
    This document sets out a laboratory sequential procedure for the froth flotation testing of fine coal, e.g. coal having a particle size of less than 0,5 mm. The procedure provides a means of evaluating the flotation characteristics for coal (expressed as a yield/ash relationship) that can be expected from the froth flotation process.
    This document does not apply to pulp samples that cannot be dewatered without the use of heat or chemical additives. This document does not apply to procedures for the investigation of flotation kinetics.
    The test is not intended to provide plant design data.
    This document is intended to be read in conjunction with ISO 8858-1.
