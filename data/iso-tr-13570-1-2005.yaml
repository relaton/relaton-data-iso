    The purpose of ISO 13570-1:2005 is to explain how you can use the International Standards on wheelchairs to select your next wheelchair. The actual standards are very technical and, at first glance, you may not understand how this information will help you select a wheelchair or scooter. ISO 13570-1:2005 is meant to help you understand the purpose for and content of International Standards on wheelchairs.
    ISO 13570-1:2005 is divided into six clauses.
    In the manual and powered wheelchair sections, the test procedures are grouped into three categories: performance, safety, and dimensions.
    For each test procedure, ISO 13570-1:2005 includes reasons why you might need this information, a brief description of the standardized test procedure, how the results of the test will be disclosed in the manufacturer's technical product literature, and how to interpret the results of the test for your own situation.
