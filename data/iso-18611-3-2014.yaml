    ISO 18611-3:2014 describes best practice recommendations and requirements for handling, transportation, and storage of NOx reduction agent AUS 40 (aqueous urea solution), specified in ISO 18611-1. These recommendations and requirements are necessary to preserve the specified quality of AUS 40 from any point of production to the point where it is filled into the on-board tank of the vehicle, in order to ensure the proper function of the selective catalytic reduction (SCR) converter systems.
    This International Standard is covering quality requirements and guidelines for AUS 40 for marine applications, irrespective of manufacturing method or technique.
