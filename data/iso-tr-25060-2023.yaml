    This document describes information items enabling systematic human-centred design for interactive systems.
    Some of these information items are elaborated by separate International Standards, named the Common Industry Format (CIF) for usability-related information.
    This document provides the framework of information items, including definitions and the content for each information item.
    This document includes the following:
    —     the intended users of the information items;
    —     consistent terminology;
    —     the high-level content structure to be used for documenting each information item.
    The information items are intended to be used as part of system-level documentation resulting from development processes such as those in ISO 9241-210, ISO 9241-220 and ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 7 process standards (e.g. ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288, ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148).
    This document focuses on those information items needed for design, development and evaluation of usable systems, rather than prescribing a specific process. It is intended to be used in conjunction with existing International Standards, including the standards of the ISO 9241 series and the SQuaRE documents.
    This document does not prescribe any kind of method, life cycle or process.
    NOTE          The information items produced by human-centred design activities can be incorporated in design approaches as diverse as object-oriented, waterfall, HFI (human factors integration), agile and rapid development.
