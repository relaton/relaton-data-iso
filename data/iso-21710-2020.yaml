    This document specifies requirements for data management and publication in microbial resource centres (MRCs) to enable consistent formatting, and a quality control workflow to improve the overall quality of data. It also provides recommendations for MRCs to improve data sharing and integration of microbial material and associated data.
    This document is intended to facilitate procedures such as accessioning, acquisition, authentication, preservation, storage, and distribution, and can be used by MRCs, regulatory authorities, organizations, and schemes using peer-assessment to confirm or recognize the competence of MRCs in data management and publication
    NOTE     International, national and/or regional regulations or requirements can also apply to specific topics covered in this document.
