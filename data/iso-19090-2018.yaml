    ISO 19090:2018 specifies the test method to be followed for measuring and documenting the cell migration ability of porous bioactive ceramic materials.
    ISO 19090:2018 is not applicable to porous materials that have low or no cell adhesion properties, for instance synthetic polymers and metals. These types of materials will require longer times to allow effective transfer and migration of cells from the cultured substrate to the test specimen. To minimize influences of cell passages, cell kinds, differences in cell culture consumables including culture medium and fetal bovine serum etc., the method uses a porous bioactive ceramics, which is clinically and widely used in each country, as a reference material for calculation of relative migration distance.
