abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 18000-2:2004 defines the air interface for radio-frequency identification
    (RFID) devices operating below 135 kHz used in item management applications. Its
    purpose is to provide a common technical specification for RFID devices to allow
    for compatibility and to encourage inter-operability of products for the growing
    RFID market in the international marketplace. ISO/IEC 18000-2:2004 defines the
    forward and return link parameters for technical attributes including, but not
    limited to, operating frequency, operating channel accuracy, occupied channel
    bandwidth, spurious emissions, modulation, duty cycle, data coding, bit rate,
    bit rate accuracy, bit transmission order. It further defines the communications
    protocol used in the air interface.\nISO/IEC 18000-2:2004 contains two types.
    The detailed technical differences between the types are shown in the parameter
    tables.\nISO/IEC 18000-2:2004 specifies\n- the physical layer that is used for
    communication between the interrogator and the tag;\n- the protocol and the commands;\n-
    the method to detect and communicate with one tag among several tags (\"anti-collision\").\nIt
    specifies two types of tags: Type A (FDX) and Type B (HDX). These two types differ
    only by their physical layer. Both types support the same anti-collision and protocol.\nFDX
    tags are permanently powered by the interrogator, including during the tag-to-interrogator
    transmission. They operate at 125 kHz. \nHDX tags are powered by the interrogator,
    except during the tag-to-interrogator transmission. They operate at 134,2 kHz.
    An alternative operating frequency is described. \nAn optional anti-collision
    mechanism is also described."
