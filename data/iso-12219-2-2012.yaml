    ISO 12219-2:2012 specifies the sampling bag test method for measuring volatile organic compounds (VOCs), formaldehyde and other carbonyl compounds which may diffuse from vehicle interior parts into the air inside road vehicles. This method is intended for evaluating and screening new vehicle interior parts and materials such as seats, the instrument panel, ceiling materials and so on.
    The test method specified in ISO 12219-2:2012 specifies a procedure for screening of VOCs, formaldehyde and other carbonyl compounds using sampling bags.
    ISO 12219-2:2012 provides third party test laboratories and manufacturing industry with a cost-effective approach for: a) evaluating and screening prototype, "low-diffusion" materials or products during development; b) comparing diffusions from products within a range (e.g. different colours or patterns).
    ISO 12219-2:2012 specifies the design, construction, performance, evaluation, and use of sampling bags for testing vapour-phase organic emissions diffused from vehicle interior parts.
