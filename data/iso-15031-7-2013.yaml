    ISO 15031-7:2013 gives guidelines for the protection of road vehicle modules from unauthorized intrusion through a vehicle diagnostic data link. These security measures offer vehicle manufacturers the flexibility to tailor their security to their own specific needs and do not exclude other, additional measures.
    ISO 15031-7:2013 applies to vehicle modules whose solid-state memory contents are able to be altered from outside the electronic module through a diagnostic data communication link. Such alteration could potentially damage a vehicle's electronics or other components, placing at risk its compliance with government legislation or the vehicle manufacturer's interests in respect of security.
