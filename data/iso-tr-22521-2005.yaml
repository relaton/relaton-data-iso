  content: ISO/TR 22521:2005 provides comparative data, obtained from various manufacturers
    and other official sources, for the year 2002, on the vibration emission values
    at the handles of portable hand-held forestry machinery. It is applicable to chain
    saws, brush-cutters and grass-trimmers in the full range of engine sizes. International
    Standards ISO 11681-1, ISO 11681-2 and ISO 11806 require that these machines be
    designed, based on the state of the art and existing vibration emission data,
    to generate vibration values as low as practicable, and ISO/TR 22521 is intended
    to assist in determining compliance with that requirement.
