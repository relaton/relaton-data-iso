abstract:
- content: Gives a conductive method for determining the rate of solution. Describes
    the principles of the procedure by dissolution of an agreed test portion in water
    at an agreed temperature, with controlled agitation. Measurement of the conductivity
    of the solution, at certain intervals, of the final conductivity (when the sample
    is completely dissolved) and calculation of the ratio of conductivities to the
    final conductivity at an agreed time, thus, a measure of the rate of solution
    is obtained. Details of the laboratory stirrer are illustrated in a figure.
