    ISO 22000:2006 specifies the immunity levels that represent essential EMC requirements, and test conditions for lifts, escalators and moving walks that are permanently installed in buildings and for which ISO/TC 178 has direct responsibility for the production of International Standards, in relation to continuous and transient, conducted and radiated disturbances including electrostatic discharges. It addresses commonly known EMC related hazards and hazardous situations relevant to lifts, escalators and moving walks when they are used as intended and under the conditions foreseen by the manufacturer.
    Since lifts travel large vertical distances in buildings, it becomes impracticable to test the total assembly either in a test laboratory or in situ (where the uncontrolled environment may also influence the test procedures and results). Likewise, due to practical restrictions imposed by the lift car internal dimensions, it is impracticable to test the lift car from within. Similar considerations regarding dimensions apply equally to the testing of escalators and passenger conveyors. Therefore, ISO 22000:2006 applies to the sub-systems and/or apparatus of lifts, escalators and passenger conveyors, an assembly of which will comprise an installation. However, ISO 22000:2006 does not apply to lighting apparatus and also other services already proven to be in conformity to the national EMC regulations.
