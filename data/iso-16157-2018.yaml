    This document is a second level standard is one of the several others regarding human-life activity support systems and equipment integration in space flight.
    This document, along with first and third level standards, form a complex three-level international standard entitled "Space systems — Human-life activity support systems and equipment integration in space flight".
    It is applicable to human space flight programs in all manned space objects, including spacecraft, space stations, lunar and planetary bases, as well as extravehicular activity. It covers all phases for developing a manned space object, such as design, production, tests, operation, and maintenance.
