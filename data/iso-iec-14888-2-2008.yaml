abstract:
- content: |-
    ISO/IEC 14888 specifies digital signature with appendix. As no part of the message is recovered from the signature (the recoverable part of the message is empty), the signed message consists of the signature and the whole message.
    NOTE          ISO/IEC 9796 specifies digital signature giving message recovery. As all or part of the message is recovered from the signature, the recoverable part of the message is not empty. The signed message consists of either the signature only (when the non-recoverable part of the message is empty), or both the signature and the non-recoverable part.
    ISO/IEC 14888-2:2008 specifies digital signatures with appendix whose security is based on the difficulty of factoring the modulus in use. For each signature scheme, it specifies:
    - the relationships and constraints between all the data elements required for signing and verifying;
    - a signature mechanism, i.e. how to produce a signature of a message with the data elements required for signing;
    - a verification mechanism, i.e. how to verify a signature of a message with the data elements required for verifying.
    The title of ISO/IEC 14888-2 has changed from Identity-based mechanisms (first edition) to Integer factorization based mechanisms (second edition).
