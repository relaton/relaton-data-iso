    This document defines visual aspects for the identification and assessment of product characteristics for friction materials in terms of quality and for commercial and technical agreements. The sequence of the product characteristics represents no order of priority. Inspection is carried out in unused, “as supplied” condition.
    In some characteristic features, there are differences between brake linings with an effective lining pad area less than 120 cm2 and larger than 120 cm2. The acceptance criteria ensure exclusion of any characteristics that could impact the function and performance of brake linings and applies unless other agreements between the customer and the supplier.
