  content: "ISO 28500:2009 specifies the WARC file format:\n- to store both the payload
    content and control information from mainstream Internet application layer protocols,
    such as the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), Domain Name System (DNS), and
    File Transfer Protocol (FTP);\n- to store arbitrary metadata linked to other stored
    data (e.g. subject classifier, discovered language, encoding);\n- to support data
    compression and maintain data record integrity; \n- to store all control information
    from the harvesting protocol (e.g. request headers), not just response information;\n-
    to store the results of data transformations linked to other stored data; \n-
    to store a duplicate detection event linked to other stored data (to reduce storage
    in the presence of identical or substantially similar resources);\n- to be extended
    without disruption to existing functionality;\n- to support handling of overly
    long records by truncation or segmentation, where desired."
