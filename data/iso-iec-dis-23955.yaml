  content: 'This international standard specifies the technical requirements for product
    data protection of Additive Manufacturing Service Platform (AMSP). The following
    elements are within the scope of this document: Classification of product data
    information of AMSP and the protection levels. Product data protection at four
    data-processing stages, i.e. data collection, data display, data transfer and
    data deletion. Responsibilities and obligations of different entities. This standard
    is applicable for product data protection when individuals or organizations (e.g.
    commercial enterprises, government agencies and non-profit organizations) build
    an AMSP or improve existing ones to provide printing and relevant services.'
