  script: Latn
  content: ISO/IEC 14165-321:2009(E) Fibre Channel is a high speed serial interface
    using either optical or electrical connections (i.e., the physical layer) at data
    rates currently up to 2 Gbits/s with a growth path to 10 Gbits/s, and provides
    a general data transport vehicle for Upper Level Protocols (ULPs) such as Intelligent
    Peripheral Interface (IPI) and Small Computer System Interface (SCSI) command
    sets, the High-Performance Parallel Interface (HIPPI) data framing, IP (Internet
    Protocol), ANSI/IEEE 802.2, and others. The topologies supported by Fibre Channel
    include point-to-point, switched fabric, and arbitrated loop. This part of ISO/IEC
    14165 defines a protocol for transmitting audio-video (AV) streams using Fibre
    Channel Sequences and Exchanges. Fibre Channel connections used for transmitting
    AV streams utilize standard FC frame format and sequence/exchange hierarchy.
