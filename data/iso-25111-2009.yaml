  content: "ISO 25111:2009 specifies general requirements for the provision of ITS
    services, using the CALM architecture and protocols, via the use of public wireless
    networks [including cellular telephony and mobile wireless broadband (MWB) systems].
    \nIn particular, ISO 25111:2009 specifies protocols and parameters that public
    wireless networks shall include to support prolonged communication links in ITS
    environments where heterogeneous handovers or media independent handovers (MIH)
    are either necessary to maintain the link, or desirable as determined by media
    selection policies, and such handover is provided by the public wireless network.
    \nThe requirements for the use of CALM via public wireless networks where there
    is no provision for heterogeneous cell/cell handover (i.e. so-called nomadic services)
    is not the central focus of ISO 25111:2009, but general requirements to enable
    the use of such systems, within the limits of the range of a single cell, are
    also provided.\nWherever practicable, ISO 25111:2009 has been developed by reference
    to suitable extant standards, adopted by selection. Required regional variations
    are provided. \nSpecifically, for ISO 25111:2009, extant national and International
    Standards for public wireless networks are adopted by reference and are not redefined
    herein.\nApplication-specific upper layers are not included in ISO 25111:2009,
    but will be driven by application standards (which might not be technology specific)."
