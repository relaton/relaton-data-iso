abstract:
- content: "This part of ISO/IEC 14478 defines a standard set of multimedia system
    services that can be used by multimedia application de­velopers in a variety of
    computing environments. The focus is on enabling multimedia applications in a
    heterogeneous, distrib­uted computing environment. Throughout this part of ISO/IEC
    14478, this component will also be referred to as \"Multimedia Systems Services\",
    and abbreviated as MSS. \nThe Multimedia Systems Services constitutes a framework
    of \"middleware\" - system software components lying in the region between the
    generic operating system and specific applications. As middleware, the Multimedia
    Systems Services marshals low­er-level system resources to the task of supporting
    multimedia processing, providing a set of common services which can be used by
    multimedia application developers. \nThe Multimedia Systems Services encompasses
    the following characteristics:\na)         provision of an abstract type for a
    media processing node, extensible through subtyping to support abstractions of
    real media processing hardware or software;\nb)         provision of an abstract
    type for the data flow path or the connection between media processing nodes,
    encapsulating low-level connection and transport semantics;\nc)         grouping
    of multiple processing nodes and connections into a single unit for purposes of
    resource reservation and stream control;\nd)         provision or a media dataflow
    abstraction. with support for a variety of position, time and/or synchronization
    capabili­ties;\ne)         separation of the media format abstractions from the
    dataflow abstraction;\nf)          synchronous exceptions and asynchronous events;\ng)
    \        application visible characterization of object capabilities;\nh)         registration
    of objects in a distributed environment by location and capabilities;\ni)          retrieval
    of objects in a distributed environment by location and constraints;\nj)          definition
    of a Media Stream Protocol to support media independent transport and synchronization.\nThe
    Multimedia Systems Services rely on the object model of ISO/IEC 14478-1 (Fundamentals
    of PREMO) and the object types and non-object data types defined in TSO/IEC 14478-2
    (PREMO Foundation Component)."
