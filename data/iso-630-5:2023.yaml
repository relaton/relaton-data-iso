    This document specifies qualities for flat and long products of hot-rolled structural steels with improved atmospheric corrosion resistance in the as-rolled, normalized/normalized rolled, thermomechanical control processed and quenched and tempered delivery conditions. It is applicable to steel plates rolled on a reversing mill, wide flats, hot-rolled sections and bars, which are intended for use in welded or bolted structures.
    This document covers 14 grades and 5 qualities. Grades S235, S295, S355, S420, S460, S500 and S550 are covered in Annex A. Grades SG245, SG345, SG365, SG400, SG460, SG500, and SG700 are covered in Annex B. Not all grades are available in all qualities, and some qualities have Charpy V-notch requirements.
    The steels specified in this document are applicable to hot-rolled plates, wide flats, sections and bars with a maximum nominal thickness of 150 mm for grades S235W, S295W, S355W, S420W, S460W, S500W and S550W, with a maximum nominal thickness of 200 mm for grades SG245, SG345, SG365, SG400, SG460, SG500, and SG700.
    The steels specified in this document are applicable to hot-rolled plates with a maximum nominal thickness of 20 mm for grades S295WP and S355WP.
    The steels specified in this document are applicable to hot-rolled wide flats, sections and bars with a maximum nominal thickness of 40 mm for grades S295WP and S355WP.
    The steels specified in this document are applicable to hot-rolled plates with a maximum nominal thickness of 80 mm for grade S355WSE.
    This document does not include the following structural steels, some of which are covered by other International Standards.
    —          sheet and strip, e.g. ISO 4995 or ISO 4996;
    —          tubular products. e.g. ISO 12633-1, ISO 12633-2.
    NOTE            In this document, the term of "thickness" is considered as "nominal thickness", unless otherwise stated.
