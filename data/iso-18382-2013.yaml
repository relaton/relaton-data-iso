  content: "ISO 18382:2013 provides recommended practices for the utilization of Radio
    Frequency Identification (RFID) protocol and communication standards in support
    of inventory management activities associated with space missions.  \nThe recommended
    practices contained in ISO 18382:2013 enable member agencies to select the best
    option(s) available for interoperable RFID-based communications in the support
    of inventory management applications.  The specification of a Recommended Practice
    facilitates interoperable communications and forms the foundation for cross-support
    of communication systems between separate member space agencies.\nISO 18382:2013
    is targeted towards passive (unpowered) RFID tags transmitting in the 860 MHz
    ? 960 MHz Ultra High Frequency (UHF) radio band.  The recommended practices are
    applicable to both terrestrial (ground-based) and space-based automated inventory
    management systems utilizing only passive RFID tags.\nActive RFID systems and
    utilization of RFID tags for precision asset localization are not covered in ISO
    18382:2013."
