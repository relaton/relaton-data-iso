abstract:
- content: Specifies methods for the testing of optical instruments and instruments
    containing optical components under equivalent conditions, for their ability to
    resist salt mist. The purpose of testing is to assess as early as possible the
    ability of the instrument and, particularly, of its surfaces and protective coatings,
    to resist the effects of a salt atmosphere. Normally, representative samples or
    complete small units are used for testing. Complete large instruments or assemblies
    are only tested in exceptional cases.
