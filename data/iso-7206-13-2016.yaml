    ISO 7206-13:2016 describes a method of determining the torque required, under specified laboratory conditions, to loosen the fixation of the head of hip joint prostheses in which the head is not intended to rotate relative to the neck. It applies to the femoral component of total or partial hip joint replacements in which the head and neck/stem (in the following referred to as cone) are secured together by a locking conical taper or any other means and in which the head and cone are separate components, and which are made of metallic or non-metallic materials.
    It does not cover methods of examining the test specimens; these should be agreed between the test laboratory and the party submitting the specimen for test.
