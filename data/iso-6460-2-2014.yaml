abstract:
- content: ISO 6460-2:2014 defines test cycles for measurement for the gaseous exhaust
    emissions from motorcycles, as well as for determining the fuel consumption of
    motorcycles as defined in ISO 3833, equipped with a spark ignition engine (four-stroke
    engine, two-stroke engine, or rotary piston engine) or a compression ignition
    engine. The test cycle 1 is equivalent to the test cycle specified in the European
    Union Commission Directive 2003/77/EC[6] and the test cycle 2 is equivalent to
    the test cycle specified in global technical regulations No.2 (WMTC), United Nations
    Economic Commission for Europe, ECE/TRANS/180/Add.2[9]. A selection of other test
    cycles adopted or to be adopted by several countries is described in Annex C for
    information purpose.
