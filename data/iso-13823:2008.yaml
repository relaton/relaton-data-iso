- content: "ISO 13823:2008 specifies general principles and recommends procedures
    for the verification of the durability of structures subject to known or foreseeable
    environmental actions, including mechanical actions, causing material degradation
    leading to failure of performance. It is necessary to insure reliability of performance
    throughout the design service life of the structure. \nFatigue failure due to
    cyclic stress is not within the scope of ISO 13823:2008."
