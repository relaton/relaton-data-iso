  content: specifies both preliminary levelling and geometrical tests for these general
    purpose and normal accuracy broaching machines, and gives the corresponding permissible
    deviations which apply. Gives also the terminology used for the main elements
    of the machine (in English, French and Russian as well as the equivalent terms
    in German and Italian). It deals only with the verification of accuracy of the
    machine. It does not apply to the testing of the running of the machine, nor to
    machine characteristics which should generally be checked before the accuracy
    is tested.
