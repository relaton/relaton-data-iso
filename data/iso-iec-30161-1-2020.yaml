    ISO/IEC 30161-1:2020(E) specifies requirements for an Internet of Things (IoT) data exchange platform for various services in the technology areas of:
    • the middleware components of communication networks allowing the co-existence of IoT services with legacy services;
    • the end-points performance across the communication networks among the IoT and legacy services;
    • the IoT specific functions and functionalities allowing the efficient deployment of IoT services;
    • the IoT service communication networks’ framework and infrastructure; and
    • the IoT service implementation guideline for the IoT data exchange platform
