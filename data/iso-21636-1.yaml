  content: "ISO 21636 provides a framework for the identification and description
    of varieties of all individual human languages, including sign languages (cf.
    ISO 639).  This excludes artificial means of communication with or between machines
    (such as programming languages) and those means of human communication which are
    not fully nor largely equivalent to human language (such as sets of individual
    symbols or gestures that each carry isolated meanings but cannot be freely combined
    into complex expressions). \nThis document, Part 1 of ISO 21636, provides the
    terminology necessary to identify basic dimensions and sub-dimensions of linguistic
    variation and the resulting varieties, including major modalities of human communication."
