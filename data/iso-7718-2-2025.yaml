    This document specifies minimum requirements for dimensions and unobstructed space around upper deck passenger doors on the outer skin of civil transport aircraft, applicable when these doors are designed to accept the connection of existing passenger boarding bridges or transfer vehicles.
    This document is not applicable to existing models of civil transport aircraft, or derivative models with entry into service up to the year 2000 with the same fuselage, for which the aircraft-mating section of passenger boarding bridges or passenger transfer vehicles is expected to be compatible with ISO 16004.
