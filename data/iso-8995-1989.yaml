  content: Identifies the parameters that influence visual performance. It also presents
    the criteria that have to be satisfied in order to achieve an acceptable visual
    environment. Is applicable to working areas in industrial buildings, offices and

    as projection, viewing of transparencies, and handling of photosensitive materials.
