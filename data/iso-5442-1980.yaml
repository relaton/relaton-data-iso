  content: Applicable to products having contents, expressed as sulphate2- , between
    0.03 % (m/m) and 0.5 % (m/m). Reduction of the compounds to hydrogen sulphide
    by heating with a mixture of hydriodic and hypophosphorus acids in the presence
    of hydrochloric acid. Entrainment of the hydrogen sulphide in a flow of nitrogen
    and absorption in an excess of ammoniacal cadmium acetate solution. Liberation
    of the absorbed hydrogen sulphide in the presence of an excess of standard volumetric
    iodate/iodide solution. Back-titration of the excess iodine with standard volumetric
    sodium thiosulphate solution using starch as the indicator. An apparatus for reduction,
    entrainment and absorption is shown in a figure. Has also been approved by the
    IUPAC.
