abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 10646:2104 specifies the Universal Character Set (UCS). It is
    applicable to the representation, transmission, interchange, processing, storage,
    input and presentation of the written form of the languages of the world as well
    as additional symbols. It covers 120 585 characters from the world's scripts.\nISO/IEC
    10646:2014:\n- specifies the architecture of ISO/IEC 10646;\n- defines terms used
    ISO/IEC 10646;\n- describes the general structure of the UCS codespace;\n- specifies
    the Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP) of the UCS;\n- specifies supplementary planes
    of the UCS: the Supplementary Multilingual Plane (SMP), the Supplementary Ideographic
    Plane (SIP), the Tertiary Ideographic Plane (TIP), and the Supplementary Special-purpose
    Plane (SSP);\n- defines a set of graphic characters used in scripts and the written
    form of languages on a world-wide scale;\n- specifies the names for the graphic
    characters and format characters of the BMP, SMP, SIP, SSP and their coded representations
    within the UCS codespace. (Note: TIP is currently empty);\n- specifies the coded
    representations for control characters and private use characters;\n- specifies
    three encoding forms of the UCS: UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32;\n- specifies seven
    encoding schemes of the UCS: UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-16BE, UTF-16LE, UTF-32, UTF-32BE,
    and UTF-32LE;\n- specifies the management of future additions to this coded character
    set.\nThe charts of the ideographic characters are now in multi-column format.\nThe
    UCS is an encoding system different from that specified in ISO/IEC 2022. ISO/IEC
    10646:2014 specifies the method to designate UCS from ISO/IEC 2022.\nA graphic
    character will be assigned only one code point in the standard, located either
    in the BMP or in one of the supplementary planes. \nBy defining a consistent way
    of encoding multilingual text it enables the exchange of data internationally.
    The information technology industry gains data stability, greater global interoperability
    and data interchange. ISO/IEC 10646 has been widely adopted on the World Wide
    Web and implemented in modern operating systems and computer languages."
