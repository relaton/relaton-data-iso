  script: Latn
  content: Specifies the most common formulae and the corresponding head-loss coefficients
    to be applied for the calculation of the mean flow velocities in asbestos-cement
    pipelines, carrying potable water or sewage in full or partly full cross-section
    of pipeline, excluding piping systems in buildings. The discharge of a pipeline
    is the product of the area of the fluid in the wet cross-section multiplied by
    the mean flow velocity.
