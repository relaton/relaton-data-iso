  content: "This document specifies the assessment methods of 3D scanned data for
    3D printing model for the accuracy and precision in the total 3D printing life
    cycle.\nThis document focus mainly on 3D scanned data from computed tomography.
    Computed tomography can acquire the information of internal structures, regional
    density, orientation and/or alignment of scanning objects as well as shape and
    appearance. \nThis document is not intended to evaluate the 3D printed product
    itself."
