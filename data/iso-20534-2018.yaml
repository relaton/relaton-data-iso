    This document specifies a formal logic-based concept specialization approach to support the development of manufacturing reference models that underpin the necessary business specific knowledge models needed to support the configuration of global production networks.
    This document specifies the following:
    —          the formal sematic model approach;
    —          hierarchical levels for property specialization;
    —          contexts for each level;
    —          key properties at each level;
    —          property relationships;
    —          property axioms;
    —          applicability rules.
    The following are within the scope of this document:
    —          production networks for discrete product manufacture;
    —          formal semantics for the configuration of global production networks;
    —          system level formal semantics;
    —          designed system formal semantics;
    —          manufacturing business system formal semantics;
    —          global production systems network formal semantics.
    The following are outside the scope of this document:
    —          in-factory formal semantics;
    —          formal semantics for the operation of global production networks.
