    This document specifies test conditions and test procedures for determining the performance characteristics of air source heat pump water heaters for hot water supply with electrically driven compressors with or without supplementary electric heater and connected to or including only one hot water storage tank. Hot water storage tanks that are connected in series or parallel and behave hydronically as one single tank are considered as one hot water storage tank. In the case of heat pump water heaters consisting of several parts with refrigerant or water connections, this document applies only to those designed and supplied as a complete package.
    NOTE       This document is not applicable to testing procedures for simultaneous operation for hot water supply and space heating. "Simultaneous" means that hot water supply and space heating generation occur at the same time and may interact.
