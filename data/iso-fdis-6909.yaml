  content: "This document specifies technical safety requirements and measures to
    be adopted by persons undertaking the design, manufacture and supply of press
    brakes which are intended to work cold metal or material partly of cold metal
    but which can be used in the same way to work other sheet materials (e.g. cardboard,
    plastic, rubber, leather, etc.) and also referred to as machines.\nNOTE 1 The
    design of a machine includes the study of the machine itself, taking into account
    all phases of the “life” of the machine mentioned in ISO 12100:2010, 5.4, and
    the drafting of the instructions related to all the above phases.\nThis document
    covers the following types of machines (see Annex J) :\n-\tHydraulic press brakes\n-\tHydraulic
    servo-drive press brakes\n-\tScrew servo-drive press brakes\n-\tBelt-spring servo-drive
    press brakes\n\nThe requirements in this document take account of intended use,
    as defined in ISO 12100:2010, 3.23, as well as reasonably foreseeable misuse,
    as defined in ISO 12100:2010, 3.24. This document presumes access to the press
    brake from all directions, deals with all significant hazards during the various
    phases of the life of the machine described in Clause 4, and specifies the safety
    measures for both the operator and other exposed persons.\n\nNOTE 2 All significant
    hazards means those identified or associated with press brakes at the time of
    the publication of this document.\nThis document applies to press brakes which
    can function independently or in combination (e.g. two machines in tandem or more)
    and can also be used as a guide for the design of press brakes which are intended
    to be integrated in a manufacturing system.\nThis document deals with the significant
    hazards, hazardous situations and events relevant to press brakes and ancillary
    devices (see Clause 4). This document specifies the safety requirements for press
    brakes defined in this clause.\nThis document does not cover press brakes which
    transmit energy to impart beam motion by using pneumatic means or mechanical clutch
    or press brakes that use combination of technologies (e.g. combined hydraulic
    and screw servo-drive press brake or combined hydraulic servo-drive and screw
    servo-drive press brake)\nThis document does not cover machines whose principal
    designed purpose is:\na)\tsheet folding by rotary action;\nb)\ttube and pipe bending
    by rotary action;\nc)\troll bending.\nThis document does not cover hazards related
    to the use of press brakes in explosive atmospheres.\nThis document is not applicable
    to press brakes which are manufactured before the date of its publication.\nThis
    document does not cover the safety aspect of equipment for automatic loading and
    unloading where provided. Guidance on how to take into account additional automatic
    loading and unloading equipment can be found in ISO 11161."
