    This document specifies a test procedure for the preparation of test prints on paper, board, metals, foils and other suitable substrates using paste inks, such as for offset and letterpress printing, using electrically driven IGT-type and prüfbau-type printability testers.
    This document describes the procedure for reference optical density and reference ink film thickness.
    This document describes the method as used on the current models of testers. Most of the described procedures are also applicable in analogy to the older models but can require additional steps to be executed or recalculation of the settings to make them conform to this document
