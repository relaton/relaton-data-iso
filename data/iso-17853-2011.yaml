  script: Latn
  content: ISO 17853:2011 specifies methods for sampling wear particles generated
    by joint replacement implants in humans and in joint simulators. It specifies
    the apparatus, reagents and test methods to isolate and characterize both polymer
    and metal wear particles from samples of tissues excised from around the joint
    replacement implant, obtained at revision surgery or post mortem, and from samples
    of joint simulator test fluids. Some of these procedures could certainly be adapted
    for isolation and characterization of particles from human biological fluids (e.g.
    synovial fluid).
