abstract:
- content: |-
    ISO 12132:2017 gives guidelines for the preparation of a Design FMEA for thin-walled half bearings used in machinery, e.g. internal combustion engines (the Process FMEA is the responsibility of the supplier). It lists the common potential failure mode(s), potential effect(s) and potential cause(s) of failure.
    The numerical evaluation of risks in terms of occurrence, severity and detection can be specific to each application, manufacturer and customer.
    Since they have to be assessed in each case, the numerical data are not included in this document. General guidance on statistical assessment can be obtained from the references.
