    ISO 18283:2006 defines the basic terms used in manual sampling of hard coal and coke and describes the general principles of sampling. ISO 18283:2006 specifies procedures and requirements for establishing a manual sampling scheme, methods of manual sampling, sampling equipment, handling and storage of samples, sample preparation and a sampling report.
    ISO 18283:2006 applies to manual sampling from fuels in movement. Guidelines for manual sampling from fuels in stationary situations are given, but this method of sampling does not provide a representative test sample and the sampling report shall state this.
    ISO 18283:2006 does not include sampling of brown coals and lignites, sampling from coal seams or mechanical sampling of coal and coke.
