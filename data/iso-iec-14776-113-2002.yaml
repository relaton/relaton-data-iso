  content: This standard defines the mechanical, electrical, timing, and protocol
    requirements of the SCSI parallel interface to allow conforming SCSI devices to
    inter-operate. The SCSI parallel interface is a local I/O bus that may be operated
    over a wide range of transfer rates. The objectives of the SCSI parallel interface
    are:a) To provide host computers with device independence within a class of devices.
    Thus, different disk drives, tape drives, printers, optical media drives and other
    SCSI devices may be added to the host computers without requiring modifications
    to generic system hardware. Provision is made for theaddition of special features
    and functions through the use of vendor-specific options. Reserved areas are provided
    for future standardization.b) To provide compatibility such that conforming SCSI-2
    and SPI-2 devices may interoperate with SPI-3 devices given that the systems engineering
    is correctly done. Conforming SCSI-2 and SPI-2 devices should respond in an acceptable
    manner to reject SPI-3 protocol extensions. SPI-3 protocolextensions are designed
    to be permissive of such rejections and thus allow SCSI-2 and SPI-2 devices to
    continue operation without requiring the use of the extensions.The interface protocol
    includes provision for the connection of multiple initiators (SCSI devices capable
    of initiating an I/O process) and multiple targets (SCSI devices capable of responding
    to a request to perform an I/O process). Distributed arbitration (i.e., bus-contention
    logic) is built into the architecture of this standard. A default priority system
    awards interface control to the highest priority SCSI device that is contending
    for use of the bus and an optional fairness algorithm is defined.This standard
    defines the physical attributes of an input/output bus for interconnecting computers
    and peripheral devices.This standard has made obsolete the following:a) The high
    voltage differential (HVD) option of differential driver/receivers. Implementations
    that useHVD should reference the SCSI Parallel Interface-2 standard (ISO/IEC 14776-112).b)
    The 32-bit SCSI bus width option. Implementations that use 32-bit wide buses should
    referencethe SCSI Parallel Interface-2 standard (ISO/IEC 14776-112).c) The SCSI
    configured automatically (SCAM) option. Implementations that use SCAM shouldreference
    the SCSI Parallel Interface-2 standard (ISO/IEC 14776-112).d) The CONTINUE TASK
    message and the TARGET TRANSFER DISABLE message. Implementationsthat use the CONTINUE
    TASK message or TARGET TRANSFER DISABLE message shouldreference the SCSI Parallel
    Interface-2 standard (ISO/IEC 14776-112).
