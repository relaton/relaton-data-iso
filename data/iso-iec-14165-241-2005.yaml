abstract:
- content: 'Fibre Channel provides a general data transport vehicle for Upper Level
    Protocols (ULPs) such as Intelligent Peripheral Interface (IPI) and Small Computer
    System Interface (SCSI) command sets, the High-Performance Parallel Interface
    (HIPPI) data framing, IP (Internet Protocol), ANSI/IEEE 802.2, and others. This
    part of ISO/IEC 14165 defines mappings for transporting Fibre Channel frames across
    the following types of backbone networks: ATM, SONET, and TCP/IP. The backbone
    mappings support the attachment of Fibre Channel switches using the facilities
    of the underlying backbone network. Details regarding the mappings of Fibre Channel
    to ATM and SONET are completely specified in this FC-BB-2 standard. With respect
    to TCP/IP, the FC-BB-2 and IETF Fibre Channel over TCP/IP specifications together
    describe how Fibre Channel frames are transported over a TCP/IP backbone. '
