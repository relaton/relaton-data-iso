- content: |-
    The ISO/IEC 10373 series defines test methods for characteristics of identification cards according to the definition given in ISO/IEC 7810. Each test method is cross‑referenced to one or more base standards, which can be ISO/IEC 7810 or one or more of the supplementary standards that define the information storage technologies employed in identification card applications.
    NOTE 1    Criteria for acceptability do not form part of the ISO/IEC 10373 series, but can be found in the International Standards mentioned above.
    This document defines test methods which are specific to proximity cards and objects, proximity coupling devices and proximity extended devices, defined in ISO/IEC 14443‑1, ISO/IEC 14443‑2, ISO/IEC 14443‑3 and ISO/IEC 14443‑4.
    NOTE 2    Test methods defined in this document are intended to be performed separately. A given proximity card or object, proximity coupling device or proximity extended device, is not required to pass through all the tests sequentially.
    ISO/IEC 10373‑1 defines test methods which are common to one or more integrated circuit card technologies and other parts in the ISO/IEC 10373 series deal with other technology‑specific tests.
    The conformance test plan defined in Annex O specifies the list of tests applicable for each part of the ISO/IEC 14443 series.
