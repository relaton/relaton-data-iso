  content: "This document describes a method for measuring adhesion strength between
    microcircuits and substrates by scratching with the wedged-shape diamond stylus.
    Using the traditional adhesion test, it is difficult to evaluate the adhesion
    strength of the microcircuits with a narrower scratching stylus. \nDuring the
    test, applying stylus force is constant or progressive and normal to the surface.
    This yields adhesive and/or cohesive failures of the microcircuit coating-substrate
    system.\nThis test method is suitable for evaluating copper microcircuits up to
    a width of tens of micrometres. It might also be ideal for evaluating fine patterns
    of other widths and materials. This International Standard intends to use in the
    macro force range (0.1 N to 30 N). Although the proposed procedure may apply to
    other force ranges, an appropriate calibration is required to quantify the normal
    forces at which failures occur."
