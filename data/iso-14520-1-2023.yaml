    This document specifies requirements and gives recommendations for the design, installation, testing, maintenance and safety of gaseous firefighting systems in buildings, plants or other structures, and the characteristics of the various extinguishants and types of fire for which they are a suitable extinguishing medium.
    It covers total flooding systems primarily related to buildings, plants and other specific applications, utilizing electrically non-conducting gaseous fire extinguishants that do not leave a residue after discharge and for which there are sufficient data currently available to enable validation of performance and safety characteristics by an appropriate independent authority. This document does not apply to explosion suppression.
    This document is not intended to indicate approval of the extinguishants listed therein by the appropriate authorities, as other extinguishants can be equally acceptable. CO2 is not included as it is covered by other International Standards.
    This document applies to the extinguishants listed in Table 1. It is essential that it be used in conjunction with the separate parts of the ISO 14520 series for specific extinguishants, as cited in Table 1.
