  content: "ISO/IEC 15938-9:2005 collects standard profiles and levels for MPEG-7,
    specified across all parts of ISO/IEC 15938. While all parts are potential candidates
    for profiling, current profiles concentrate on the Description definition language
    [ISO/IEC 15938-2], Visual [ISO/IEC 15938-3], Audio [ISO/IEC 15938-4], Multimedia
    description schemes [ISO/IEC 15938-5], which are based on the namespace versioning
    defined in Schema definition [ISO/IEC 15938-10].\nISO/IEC 15938-9:2005 provides
    a set of well-defined definitions and processing rules for description profile
    and description level, where: \n- A description profile provides a means of selecting
    and constraining description tools from the MPEG-7 schema, thereby constraining
    conforming descriptions in their content. A description profile generally limits
    the use of description tools to subsets of the description tools defined in MPEG-7.
    The description tools in a description profile support a set of functionalities
    for a certain class of applications.\n- A description level defines further constraints
    to limit the complexity of conforming descriptions, for a given description profile.
    Such constraints may be restrictions on the syntax and/or semantics of the selected
    description tools. For example, a particular element within a data type may be
    excluded from occurring in descriptions. Description levels may mandate the usage
    of a data type in descriptions, and may also limit the size of conforming descriptions.\nCurrently,
    ISO/IEC 15938-9:2005 standardizes the following profiles:\n- Simple Metadata Profile
    (SMP) - describes simple metadata tagging for single instances of multimedia clips.
    This profile can be used in the areas such as music, images and mobile applications,
    just to name a few.\n- User Description Profile (UDP) - describes the personal
    preferences and usage patterns of users of multimedia content. Descriptions of
    users' preferences enable automatic discovery, selection and recommendation or
    recording of multimedia content. Preferences can be automatically inferred from
    the user's prior viewing and listening habits, which can in turn be derived from
    a usage history. The goal is to support improved usability of a variety of multimedia
    devices through personalization: personalized multimedia services offered to the
    consumer, personalized multimedia content discovery, filtering and selection,
    and personalized consumption of multimedia content.\n- Core Description Profile
    (CDP) - describes general multimedia content such as images, videos, audio, and
    collections. Furthermore, content collections spanning various media types can
    also be described. As such, this profile provides a core set of tools that can
    be used to describe common multimedia content for a broad range of applications,
    such as general multimedia creation, consumption and distribution, broadcast television
    programming and educational courseware, just to name a few."
