  content: "ISO 16175-2:2011 is applicable to products that are often termed \"electronic
    records management systems\" or \"enterprise content management systems\". ISO
    16175-2:2011 uses the term digital records management systems for those software
    applications whose primary function is records management. It does not seek to
    set requirements for records still in use and held within business systems. Digital
    objects created by email, word processing, spreadsheet and imaging applications
    (such as text documents, and still or moving images), where they are identified
    to be of business value, are managed within digital records management systems
    which meet the functional requirements established in ISO 16175-2:2011. \nRecords
    managed by a digital records management system can be stored on a variety of different
    media formats, and can be managed in hybrid record aggregations that include both
    digital and non-digital elements.\nISO 16175-2:2011 does not attempt to include
    requirements that are not specific to, or necessary for, records management, for
    example, general system management and design requirements. Nor does it include
    requirements common to all software applications, such as performance, scalability
    and usability. Given the target audience of ISO 16175-2:2011, it also assumes
    a level of knowledge about developing design specifications, procurement and evaluation
    processes, and therefore these issues are not covered in ISO 16175-2:2011. Nonetheless,
    the importance of non-records management functional requirements for records management
    systems is recognized through their inclusion is given in the high-level model
    for structure and overview of functional requirements.\nISO 16175-2:2011 does
    not give specifications for the long-term preservation of digital records; this
    issue needs to be addressed separately within a dedicated framework for digital
    preservation or \"digital archiving\" at the strategic level. These digital preservation
    considerations transcend the life of systems and are system independent; they
    need to be assessed in a specific migration and conversion plan at the tactical
    level. However, recognition of the need to maintain records for as long as they
    are required is addressed in ISO 16175-2:2011, and potential format obsolescence
    issues need to be considered when applying the functional requirements.\nISO 16175-2:2011
    articulates a set of functional requirements for digital records management systems.
    These requirements apply to records irrespective of the media in which they were
    created and/or stored. The requirements are intended to: \n- define the processes
    and requirements for identifying and managing records in digital records management
    systems;\n- define the records management functionality to be included in a design
    specification when building, upgrading or purchasing digital records management
    systems software; \n- inform records management functional requirements in the
    selection of commercially available digital records management systems; and\n-
    review the records management functionality of, or assess the compliance of, an
    existing digital records management system."
