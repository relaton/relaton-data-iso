abstract:
- content: This document specifies methodologies for comparing the smoke density and
    the smoke production rate during fire tests measured by LED (light-emitting diode)
    with those measured by white light. These methodologies are intended for the identification
    of suitable LEDs which can be used as alternatives to white light sources.
