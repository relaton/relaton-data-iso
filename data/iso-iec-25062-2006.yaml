abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 25062:2006 provides a standard method for reporting usability
    test findings. The format is designed for reporting results of formal usability
    tests in which quantitative measurements were collected, and is particularly appropriate
    for summative/comparative testing. The CIF does not indicate how to perform a
    usability test but provides guidance on how to report the results of a usability
    test. The CIF targets two audiences: usability professionals and stakeholders
    in an organization. Stakeholders can use the usability data to help make informed
    decisions concerning the release of software products or the procurement of such
    products. \nThe format includes the following elements:\n- the description of
    the product,\n- the goals of the test,\n- the test participants\n- the tasks the
    users were asked to perform,\n- the experimental design of the test,\n- the method
    or process by which the test was conducted,\n- the usability measures and data
    collection methods, and\n- the numerical results."
