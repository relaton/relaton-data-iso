abstract:
- content: The estimation is carried out by acetylation of the essential oil by acetyl
    chloride and acetic anhydride, in the presence of dimethylaniline. The acetylated
    oil is isolated and dried and the ester value is determined. The free alcohols
    content is calculated taking into account the ester values of the same but non-acetylated
    essential oil. This method is applicable to essential oils containing an appreciable
    proportion of tertiary alcohols, namely of linalol and terpineol. It is not applicable
    to essential oils containing appreciable proportions of phenols, anthranilates,
    lactones and aldehydes.
