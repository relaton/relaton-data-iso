    This document investigates the stemming from requirements of charging policies and corresponding charging technologies in order to propose future standardization theme candidates.
    This document reports the findings of the investigation of charging policies and technologies in order to:
    —          Classify the conventional charging policies and the new charging policies and their functional requirements.
    —          Classify the existing technologies and the emerging technologies to be used for EFC services or other intelligent transport system (ITS) services.
    —          Conduct a gap analysis between the needs of the new charging policies and the existing standardized technologies for EFC.
    —          Recommend development of emerging standards or amendments for existing EFC standards according to the results of the gap analysis.
