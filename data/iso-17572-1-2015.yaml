    The ISO 17572 series specifies location referencing methods (LRMs) that describe locations in the context of geographic databases and will be used to locate transport-related phenomena in an encoder system as well as in the decoder side. The ISO 17572 series defines what is meant by such objects and describes the reference in detail, including whether or not components of the reference are mandatory or optional, and their characteristics.
    The ISO 17572 series specifies two different LRMs: pre-coded location references (pre-coded profile) and dynamic location references (dynamic profile).
    The ISO 17572 series does not define a physical format for implementing the LRM. However, the requirements for physical formats are defined.
    The ISO 17572 series does not define details of the Location Referencing System (LRS), i.e. how the LRMs are to be implemented in software, hardware, or processes.
    ISO 17572-1:2014 specifies the following general LRM-related sections:
    -requirements of a location referencing method;
    -conceptual data model for location referencing methods;
    -inventory location referencing methods;
    -examples of conceptual model use;
    -description of selected UML elements;
    -comparison of definitions with ISO/TC 211;
    -introduction to the TPEG physical format.
