  content: Belongs to a series of standards concerned with the major subjekt; further
    parts will extend the range by using larger flames. The measurements are intended
    for a combination of materials used in upholstered seating and not for a particular
    finished item of furniture incorporating these material. They only give an indication
    of, but cannot guarantee, the ignition behaviour of the finished item of furniture.
