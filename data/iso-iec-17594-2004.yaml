abstract:
- content: |-
    ISO/IEC 17594:2004 specifies the characteristics of a case for use with the 120 mm and 80 mm DVD-RAM disks specified in ISO/IEC 17592. ISO/IEC 17594:2004 specifies nine related, but different implementations of this case.
    ISO/IEC 17594:2004 specifies:
    - the environments in which the cases are to be operated and stored;
    - the dimensional and mechanical characteristics of the case, so as to provide mechanical interchangeability between data processing systems.
    ISO/IEC 17594:2004 provides for mechanical interchange between optical disk drives. Together with ISO/IEC 17592 for 120 mm (4,7 Gbytes per side) and 80 mm (1,46 Gbytes per side) DVD-RAM disks and a standard for volume and file structure, it provides for full data interchange between data processing systems.
