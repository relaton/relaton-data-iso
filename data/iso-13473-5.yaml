- content: |-
    This document specifies a procedure for determining the magnitude of pavement surface megatexture by measuring the surface profile and calculating a megatexture descriptor from this profile. The technique is designed to give meaningful and accurate measurements and descriptions of pavement megatexture for various purposes, such as for the prediction of the acoustic quality of the pavement or the assessment of the rolling resistance.
    Since there is an overlap between megatexture and the surrounding ranges, megatexture descriptors unavoidably have a certain correlation with corresponding measures in those ranges. This document specifies measurements and procedures which are in relevant parts compatible with those in ISO 13473-1[4], ISO 8608[6] and EN 13036-5[7].
