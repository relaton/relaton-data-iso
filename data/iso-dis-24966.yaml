  content: This International Standard specifies a test method for the determination
    of the flash point of chemicals, lube oils, aviation turbine fuel, diesel fuel,
    diesel/biodiesel blends and other liquids by a continuously closed cup tester
    utilizing a specimen size of 2 ml, cup size of 7 ml, with a heating rate of 2.5
    °C per minute. This flash point test method is a dynamic method and depends on
    definite rates of temperature increase. It is one of the many flash point test
    methods available and every flash point test method, including this one, is an
    empirical method. It utilises an electric arc as the ignitor and detects the flash
    point by pressure measurement.This test method is suitable for testing samples
    with a flash point from 22,5 °C to 235,5 °C. Flash point determinations below
    22,5 °C and above 235,5 °C may be performed, but the precision has not been determined.
