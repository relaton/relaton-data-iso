  content: |-
    ISO/TR 18818:2017 describes a screening method for rapid sampling and identifying of diethanolamine (DEA) in cosmetics and raw materials used in cosmetics by gas chromatography ? mass spectroscopy (GC-MS).
    This method is not applicable to the detection and/or quantification of DEA-related ingredients. When this method is used to analyse unfamiliar sample matrices analysts are advised to confirm the applicability and flexibility of the techniques in their matrix.
    Under the conditions specified this method is reliable for quantification with DEA level at 1 000 mg/kg (0,1 %).
    However, samples with lower concentrations (<0,1 %) or otherwise unusual compositions or characteristics can present difficulties (such as, for example, peak tailing) that preclude the direct use of this method.
