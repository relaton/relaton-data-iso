abstract:
- content: "The SCSI parallel interface (SPI) is designed to provide an efficient
    peer-to-peer I/O bus with the maximum number of hosts and peripherals determined
    by the bus width (i.e., 8 or 16). Data may be transferred asynchronously or synchronously
    at rates that depend on implementation. The objectives of the SCSI parallel interface
    are: \na) To provide host computers with device independence within a class of
    devices. Thus, different disk drives, tape drives, printers, optical media drives,
    and other SCSI devices may be added to the host computers without requiring modifications
    to generic system hardware. \nb) To provide compatibility such that conforming
    SPI-2, SPI-3 devices may interoperate with SPI-5 devices given that the systems
    engineering is correctly done. \n\nThe interface protocol includes provision for
    the connection of multiple SCSI initiator ports (i.e., SCSI devices capable of
    initiating an I/O process) and multiple SCSI target ports (i.e., SCSI devices
    capable of responding to a request to perform an I/O process). \n\nThis international
    standard defines mechanical, electrical, timing requirements, command, and the
    task management delivery protocol requirements to transfer commands and data between
    SCSI devices attached to an SCSI parallel interface, i.e. to allow conforming
    SCSI devices to interoperate. It is intended to be used in conjunction with the
    SCSI command sets. The resulting interface facilitates the interconnection of
    computers and intelligent \nperipherals and thus provides a common interface standard
    for both system integrators and suppliers of intelligent peripherals. \n\nThis
    standard is a functional description. Conforming implementations may employ any
    design technique that does not violate interoperability. This standard has made
    obsolete single-ended and multimode signalling alternatives. Implementations that
    use single-ended or multimode signalling alternatives should reference the SCSI
    Parallel Interface-2 standard (ISO/IEC 14776-112)."
