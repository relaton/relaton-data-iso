abstract:
- content: This document establishes the requirements for systems engineering activities
    to be performed on projects of the United States (US) Department of Defense (DoD)
    and other defense agencies across the entire system life cycle, including the
    planning, acquisition, modification, and sustainment of defense systems. It provides
    the foundation for systems engineering within the context of ISO/IEC/IEEE 152881
    and the acquisition environment of DoD and other defense agencies at all levels
    of system hierarchy. This document provides detailed requirements for the application
    of the life cycle processes, activities, and tasks of ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 for use
    on any defense system and includes the effective integration of agreement processes,
    technical processes, technical management processes, and essential specialty engineering
    requirements.
