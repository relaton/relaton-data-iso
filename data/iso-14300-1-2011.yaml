abstract:
- content: "ISO 14300-1:2011 addresses the space programme/project management requirements,
    applicable through a top-down approach in a contractual relationship between customers
    and suppliers.\nThe applicable requirements for product assurance are given in
    ISO 14300-2. Annex A of ISO 14300-1:2011 gives the general ISO standards framework
    for space systems programme management.\nISO 14300-1:2011 is intended to be used
    as a basis when establishing and negotiating customer project management requirements,
    and guiding the supplier's responses.\nIt allows:\n- a clear definition of the
    roles, responsibilities and authorities of the different customers and suppliers;
    \n- coherence between their activities;\n- communication capability between them;\n-
    stable and rigorous project organization; and\n- as far as possible, standardization
    of the rules applicable to various programmess/projects.\nIt still allows for
    supplier flexibility in its implementation and tailoring."
