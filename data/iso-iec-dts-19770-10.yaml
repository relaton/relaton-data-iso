    This document provides highly usable guidance for implementing an ITAM system, and to meet current market demand (determined by a survey and subsequent validation activities). This guidance is intended to be applicable to all ITAM implementations.  It is provided in a way which is aligned to ISO/IEC 19770-1:2017 IT asset management systems – Requirements.
    The primary audience for this guide is organizations that want to improve their ITAM system. It is assumed that this audience has a basic knowledge of ITAM and of ISO/IEC 19770-1:2017. This guide is focused on incremental improvements to an organization's ITAM system, rather than on certification only. Organizations wishing to achieve certification against ISO/IEC 19770-1:2017 are a secondary target audience for this document.
