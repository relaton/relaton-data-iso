  content: Specifies a method of test for products when their flashpoint is below
    110 °C. The test portion is heated in the specified apparatus for liquids whose
    expected flashpoint is between ambient temperature and 110 °C, but is cooled to
    at least 3 °C below expected flshpoint for liquids whose expected flashpoint is
    below ambient temperature. The ignition triaal is carried out after the test portion
    has been maintained under equilibrium conditions for 60 s at a temperature approximately
    3 °C below the expected flashpoint. The trial is repeated at other temperatures.
    The temperatur at which the flash occurs is recorded as the flashpoint.
