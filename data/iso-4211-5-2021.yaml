    This document specifies a method for the assessment of the abrasion resistance of surfaces with foils, laminates, melamine faced boards, pigmented and transparent lacquers.
    The test is intended to be carried out on an unused part of the finished furniture, but can be carried out on test panels of the same material, finished in an identical manner to the finished product, and of a size sufficient to meet the requirements of the test.
