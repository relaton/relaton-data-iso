  content: The principle consists in neutralization of the alkalinity of a test portion,
    previously dissolved, in presence of methyl red as indicator. Addition of sodium
    fluoride, which reacts with the silicic acid, forming a euaivalent quantity of
    sodium hydroxide. Addition of a measured volume of standard volumetric hydrochloric
    acid solution in excess, followed for diluting by ethanol. Filtration of the silicic
    compound thus obtained, which is insoluble under these conditions. Titration of
    the excess of hydrochloric acid in the filtrate with standard volumetric sodium
    hydroxide solution in presence of methyl red as indicator.
