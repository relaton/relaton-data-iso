    ISO/TS 8000‑60:2017 introduces the concepts within the parts of ISO 8000 related to implementing, assessing and improving data quality management.
    The following are within the scope of ISO/TS 8000‑60:2017:
    ·         a statement of the overall scope of those parts of ISO 8000 related to data quality management;
    ·         an overview of ISO 8000‑61, which specifies a process reference model for data quality management;
    ·         an overview of ISO 8000‑62, which specifies a model that conforms to some of the requirements of ISO/IEC 33004 and that establishes a basis on which to determine the maturity of an organization with respect to data quality management;
    ·         an overview of ISO 8000-63, which specifies the measurement procedure and measurement stack by which to measure the characteristics of processes for data quality management;
    ·         an overview of ISO 8000‑64, which specifies a model that applies the Test Process Improvement method as a basis on which to determine the maturity of an organization with respect to data quality management.
    The details for implementing the parts of ISO 8000 related to data quality management are outside the scope of ISO/TS 8000‑60:2017.
