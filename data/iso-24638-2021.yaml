    This document establishes the baseline requirements for the design, fabrication and testing of space flight pressure components. It also establishes the requirements for the assembly, installation, test, inspection, operation and maintenance of the pressure systems in spacecraft and launch vehicles. These requirements, when implemented on a particular space system, ensure a high level of confidence in achieving safe and reliable operation.
    This document applies to all pressure components other than pressure vessels and pressurized structures in a pressure system. It covers lines, fittings, valves, bellows, hoses and other appropriate components that are integrated to form a pressure system.
    The requirements for pressure vessels and pressurized structures are set forth in ISO 14623.
    This document does not apply to engine components.
