abstract:
- content: "ISO 3951-5:2006 specifies a system of sequential sampling plans (schemes)
    for lot-by-lot inspection by variables. The schemes are indexed in terms of a
    preferred series of acceptance quality limit (AQL) values, ranging from 0,01 to
    10, which are defined in terms of percent nonconforming items. The schemes are
    designed to be applied to a continuing series of lots. \nISO 3951-5:2006 is designed
    for use under the following conditions: where the inspection procedure is to be
    applied to a continuing series of lots of discrete products all supplied by one
    producer using one production process; where only a single quality characteristic
    of these products is taken into consideration, which must be measurable on a continuous
    scale; where the uncertainty of the measurement system is negligible with respect
    to the production process standard deviation; where production is stable (under
    statistical control) and the quality characteristic is distributed according to
    a normal distribution (or a close approximation to the normal distribution) or
    a distribution which may be mathematically transformed to a normal distribution;
    where the standard deviation of the quality characteristic is known; and where
    a contract or standard defines an upper specification limit, a lower specification
    limit or both."
