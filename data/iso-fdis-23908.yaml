abstract:
- content: This document provides clear methods for performance-testing for sharps-injury
    protection mechanisms, whether active or passive in design, for medical devices
    containing single-used ‘sharps’ for administration and/or extraction of body/blood
    fluids and/or medicinal substances. Testing will confirm usability and elimination
    of exposure to, and risk of accidental injury from, contaminated ‘sharps’ during
    the period of intended use, including the paths to final disposal.
