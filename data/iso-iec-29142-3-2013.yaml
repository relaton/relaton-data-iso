    ISO/IEC 29142-3:2013 describes the principles and framework for environmental assessment of ink and toner cartridges used in printing devices that have a digital input printing path, including multi-function devices, including:
    a) the goals and definitions related to environmental responsibility;
    b) guidance to determine the relative benefits of reuse, recycling, recovery, and reduction techniques;
    c) identification and prioritization of environmental attributes according to each phase of the cartridge life-cycle;
    d) criteria for establishing environmentally sustainable practices.
    ISO/IEC 29142-3:2013 establishes foundational terms, definitions, attributes, and test methods for cartridge environmental standards, environmental labels, and green procurement criteria.
    ISO/IEC 29142-3:2013 standardizes treatment of environmental interactions and impacts throughout the cartridge life-cycle, and promotes harmonization of environmental standards, environmental labels, and green procurement criteria pertaining to ink and toner cartridges, thereby reducing impact on the environment and informing and benefiting the cartridge customer.
    ISO/IEC 29142-3:2013 establishes environmental terms, definitions, attributes and test methods in accordance with the terms, symbols, notations and framework of ISO/IEC 29142-1 and ISO Guide 64.
