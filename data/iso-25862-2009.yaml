  content: "ISO 25862:2009 gives requirements regarding construction and performance
    of marine magnetic compasses for navigation and steering purposes, binnacles and
    azimuth reading devices. \nAccording to the design of the ship, two types of binnacle
    are specified.\nISO 25862:2009 applies to liquid-filled magnetic compasses:\n-
    intended for ship's navigation and steering purposes in sea navigation according
    to regulations in force; \n- having a direct reading system; \n- which may be
    of the reflecting, projecting or transmitting types.\nIn the context of ISO 25862:2009,
    a magnetic compass is an instrument consisting of a directional system supported
    by a single pivot inside a bowl which is completely filled with liquid, and which
    is supported in gimbals inside or outside the bowl. Compasses without gimbals
    are also covered by ISO 25862:2009; the requirements relating to gimbals do not
    apply to such compasses.\nISO 25862:2009 applies to\n- all ships to which SOLAS
    applies (ships of gross tonnage W 150 t, engaged on international voyages and
    ships of gross tonnage W 500 t not engaged on international voyages) fitted with
    class A magnetic compasses, \n- all ships to which SOLAS does not apply, fitted
    with the class A or class B magnetic compasses, and\n- lifeboats/rescue boats
    fitted with a class B magnetic compass (as specified in Annex H).\nISO 25862:2009
    does not apply to:\n- dry card compasses,\n- types of compass designed on principles
    different from those stated above or not complying with the descriptions given,
    or\n- hand bearing compasses.\nThe requirements for the testing and certification,
    positioning in ships and the deviation adjustment of compasses are also given.\nISO
    25862:2009 unifies (i.e. cancels and replaces) ISO 449, ISO 613, ISO 694,ISO 2269
    and ISO 10316."
