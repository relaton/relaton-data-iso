abstract:
- content: Microfilming procedures, systems and methods differ from country to country.
    These differences will not affect the exchange of technical drawings and other
    drawings office documents if the specifications given here are followed. Microforms
    of technical drawings are generally produced on 35 mm unperforated film. The use
    of unitized microfilm carries for international exchange can circumvent the problems
    associated with the procedural differences in producing microforms. Specified
    are the reduction and enlargement ratios, sizes of enlargement and the resulting
    image sizes for technical drawings not larger than AO and other drawings office
    documents.
