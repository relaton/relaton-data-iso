abstract:
- content: "This document describes testing techniques (including those described
    in ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119-4) applicable for AI systems in the context of the AI system
    life cycle model stages defined in ISO/IEC 22989.  It describes how AI and ML
    assessment metrics can be used in the context of those testing techniques. \n\nIt
    also maps testing processes, including those described in ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119-2,
    to the verification and validation stages in the AI system life cycle."
