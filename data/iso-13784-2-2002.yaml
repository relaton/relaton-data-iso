  content: 'ISO 13784-2:2002 specifies a test method for determining the reaction
    to fire of sandwich panel building systems for large rooms and the resulting flame
    spread on or within the sandwich panel building construction when it is exposed
    to heat from a simulated internal fire with flames impinging directly on its internal
    corner. The test method is not intended for evaluating a product''s fire resistance.
    ISO 13784-2:2002 is applicable to both freestanding and self-supporting, and frame-supported,
    sandwich panel systems, but only to wall and ceiling or roof constructions. '
