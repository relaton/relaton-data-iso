    This document specifies a method for determining the dissipation characteristics of simulated sensible perspiration exposure on seat cushions of a wheelchair under test conditions that simulate body loading on support surfaces with flat and contoured profiles. The test method is applicable to a wide variety of seat cushion materials and constructions that are used across the world.
    The test method is intended to determine how the cushion handles a liquid load. It is not intended to determine how the cushion responds to a continuous release of liquid or vapour.
    This document also specifies apparatus to measure dissipation characteristics (of perspiration) of seat cushions and the approach to be employed in measuring these characteristics.
    This document is applicable to seat cushions for wheelchairs that include a cushion cover.
    NOTE The significance of the dissipation characteristics of the seat cushion can be greatly affected by the clothing worn, for example a moisture wicking cover might not help the skin condition of the patient sitting in a wet adult diaper.
