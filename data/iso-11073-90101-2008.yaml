abstract:
- content: |-
    ISO 11073-90101:2008 establishes a set of specifications to allow seamless multivendor interoperability and communication between point-of-care devices, data concentrators, and clinical information systems. CLSI document POCT1 provides the framework for engineers to design devices, workstations and interfaces that allow multiple types and brands of point-of-care devices to communicate bidirectionally with access points, data concentrators and laboratory information systems from a variety of vendors.
    As an interface standard, ISO 11073-90101:2008 specifies the common communication interfaces and protocols between systems and devices. It facilitates the transfer of data to support the creation of point-of-care applications, services and institutional policies. This International Standard does not directly address specific point-of-care application and service level functions, such as device lockout and operator list management. It specifies protocol, not policy. The interfaces specified support the communication required for engineers to build such application-level functionality. Specifying, building and providing the applications to support these services are left to customers, device and information system vendors.
