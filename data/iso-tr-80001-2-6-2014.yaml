abstract:
- content: ISO/TR 80001-2-6:2014 provides guidance on implementing RESPONSIBILITY
    AGREEMENTS, which are described in IEC 80001-1 as used to establish the roles
    and responsibilities among the stakeholders engaged in the incorporation of a
    MEDICAL DEVICE into an IT-NETWORK in order to support compliance to IEC 80001-1.
    Stakeholders may include RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATIONS, IT suppliers, MEDICAL DEVICE
    manufacturers and others. The goal of the RESPONSIBILITY AGREEMENT is that these
    roles and responsibilities should cover the complete lifecycle of the resulting
