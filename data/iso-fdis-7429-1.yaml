  content: "This document specifies the evaluation method for size and concentration
    indices of fine bubbles generated through a nozzle. It is only applicable to fine
    bubble dispersion in water generated through the nozzle. It describes the sampling
    method for fine bubble dispersion from the nozzle into the retention container
    and the measurement procedure of size and concentration indices. \nMajor applications
    of the equipment include parts for various industrial water systems and for such
    as consumer baths and kitchens."
