  content: The principle consists in evaporation of the test portion, taking up by
    means of hydrochloric acid and reduction of iron(III) by means of hydroxylammonium
    chloride. Formation of an iron(II)-2.2'-bipyridyl complex in a buffered medium
    at a pH value between 4.5 and 6. Photometric measurement of the coloured complex
    at a wavelength of about 522 nm.
