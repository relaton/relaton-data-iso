abstract:
- content: Specifies the nomenclature appropriate to each part of the machine (in
    English, French and Russian, and the eqivalent terms in German, Spanish, Italian
    and Swedish) and the geometrical and practiacal tests for these sawing machines,
    and gives the corresponding permissible deviations which apply to machines of
    general purpose use and normal accuracy. It deals only with the verification of
    the accuracy of the machine. It does not apply to the testing of the running of
    the machine nor to its characteristics which should generally be checked before
    the accuracy is tested.
