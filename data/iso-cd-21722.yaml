  content: This standard specifies a horizontal method for the enumeration of enterococci
    as faecal indicators in food, feed and environmental samples by the colony-count
    technique on a selective solid medium (Slanetz and Bartley agar) by an identification
    scheme based on tetrazolium reduction and formazan production following by confirmation
    based on split aesculin at 44°C on Bile Aesculin azide Agar.
