  content: ISO/TR 20526:2017 provides a state of the art of the components that make
    up account-based ticketing as currently understood. This state of the art can
    be used to identify those aspects where international standardization or coordination
    can lead to benefits. These will then be proposed as normal ISO work items, independent
    of this document.
