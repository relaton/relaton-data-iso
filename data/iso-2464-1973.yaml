abstract:
- content: This determination is preferred to that of the non-volatile organic residue,
    which is more lengthy and leads to less reproducible results. The matter represents,
    by convention, the difference obtained by subtracting from 100 th sum of the contents
    of glyceral, ash and water. The determination of the glyceraol content, determination
    of ash and the determination of water are carried out by following the procedure
    as specified.
