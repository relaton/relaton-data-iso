abstract:
- content: This document gives general guidance for the sampling and gas chromatographic
    analysis of oil carryover in biomethane or compressed natural gas (CNG). The oil
    carryover is determined by sampling on coalescing filters under defined operational
    conditions (the two first normal cubic meters delivered at a refueling station).
    The oil carryover is expressed as concentration and the range of this method is
    3 mg/kg – 30 mg/kg.
