  content: "The technologies of this document specified are:\n—          description
    languages and vocabularies to characterize devices and users;\n—          control
    information to fine tune the sensed information and the actuator command for the
    control of virtual/real worlds, i.e., user's actuation preference information,
    user's sensor preference information, actuator capability description, and sensor
    capability description\nThe adaptation engine is not within the scope of this
    document.\nThis document specifies syntax and semantics of the tools required
    to provide interoperability in controlling devices (actuators and sensors) in
    real as well as virtual worlds: \n—          Control Information Description Language
    (CIDL) as an XML schema-based language which enables one to describe a basic structure
    of control information. \n—          Device Capability Description Vocabulary
    (DCDV), an XML representation for describing capabilities of actuators such as
    lamps, fans, vibrators, motion chairs, scent generators, etc. \n—          Sensor
    Capability Description Vocabulary (SCDV), interfaces for describing capabilities
    of sensors such as a light sensor, a temperature sensor, a velocity sensor, a
    global position sensor, an intelligent camera sensor, etc. \n—          Sensory
    Effect Preference Vocabulary (SEPV), interfaces for describing preferences of
    individual user on specific sensorial effects such as light, wind, scent, vibration,
    etc. \n—          Sensor Adaptation Preference Vocabulary (SAPV), interfaces for
    describing preferences on a sensor of an individual user on each type of sensed
    information."
