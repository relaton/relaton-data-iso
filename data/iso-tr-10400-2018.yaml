    This document illustrates the formulae and templates necessary to calculate the various pipe properties given in International Standards, including
    —          pipe performance properties, such as axial strength, internal pressure resistance and collapse resistance,
    —          minimum physical properties,
    —          product assembly force (torque),
    —          product test pressures,
    —          critical product dimensions related to testing criteria,
    —          critical dimensions of testing equipment, and
    —          critical dimensions of test samples.
    For formulae related to performance properties, extensive background information is also provided regarding their development and use.
    Formulae presented here are intended for use with pipe manufactured in accordance with ISO 11960 or API 5CT, ISO 11961 or API 5D, and ISO 3183 or API 5L, as applicable. These formulae and templates can be extended to other pipe with due caution. Pipe cold-worked during production is included in the scope of this document (e.g. cold rotary straightened pipe). Pipe modified by cold working after production, such as expandable tubulars and coiled tubing, is beyond the scope of this document.
    Application of performance property formulae in this document to line pipe and other pipe is restricted to their use as casing/tubing in a well or laboratory test, and requires due caution to match the heat-treat process, straightening process, yield strength, etc., with the closest appropriate casing/tubing product. Similar caution is exercised when using the performance formulae for drill pipe.
    This document and the formulae contained herein relate the input pipe manufacturing parameters in ISO 11960 or API 5CT, ISO 11961 or API 5D, and ISO 3183 or API 5L to expected pipe performance. The design formulae in this document are not to be understood as a manufacturing warranty. Manufacturers are typically licensed to produce tubular products in accordance with manufacturing specifications which control the dimensions and physical properties of their product. Design formulae, on the other hand, are a reference point for users to characterize tubular performance and begin their own well design or research of pipe input properties.
    This document is not a design code. It only provides formulae and templates for calculating the properties of tubulars intended for use in downhole applications. This document does not provide any guidance about loads that can be encountered by tubulars or about safety margins needed for acceptable design. Users are responsible for defining appropriate design loads and selecting adequate safety factors to develop safe and efficient designs. The design loads and safety factors will likely be selected based on historical practice, local regulatory requirements, and specific well conditions.
    All formulae and listed values for performance properties in this document assume a benign environment and material properties conforming to ISO 11960 or API 5CT, ISO 11961 or API 5D and ISO 3183 or API 5L. Other environments can require additional analyses, such as that outlined in Annex D.
    Pipe performance properties under dynamic loads and pipe connection sealing resistance are excluded from the scope of this document.
    Throughout this document tensile stresses are positive.
