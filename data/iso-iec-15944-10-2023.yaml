abstract:
- content: |-
    This document specifies the fundamental principles governing coded domains, identification and description of the coded domains from the BOV view, the rules governing the rule-base of coded domains, the rules for management of ID codes, rules for specifying Human Interface Equivalents (HIEs) to an ID Code, the relations between the coded domain and controlled vocabularies, the rules governing the registration of coded domains as re-usable business objects, and the IT-enablement of coded domains.
    The document is applicable to the use of standards, specifications, authority files, etc., of a “codes representing X” nature being used in electronic business transactions among parties engaged in Open-edi, which pertains to flows of information using information bundles which cause pre-defined (or pre-definable) changes in the states of the IT systems of the parties to such electronic data interchanges.
    Detailed exclusions to the scope of this document are provided in Annex I.
