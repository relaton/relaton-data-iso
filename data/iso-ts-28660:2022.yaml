    This document specifies a method for determining the fracture toughness in term of J and R curves for plastics.
    The method is suitable for use with ductile and semi-ductile polymers and polymer blends. It is not intended to be used with materials in which the crack front cannot be distinguished from additional deformation processes in advance of the crack tip. The method is unsuitable for polymers reinforced with fibres.
    NOTE      J-R curves, produced in accordance with this test method, characterizes the crack growth resistance that cannot be characterized by linear elastic fracture mechanics according to ISO 13586.
