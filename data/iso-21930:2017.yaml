    ISO 21930:2017 provides the principles, specifications and requirements to develop an environmental product declaration (EPD) for construction products and services, construction elements and integrated technical systems used in any type of construction works.
    ISO 21930:2017 complements ISO 14025 by providing specific requirements for the EPD of construction products and services.
    ISO 21930:2017 establishes a core set of requirements to be considered as core product category rules (PCR) to develop an EPD for any construction product or service.
    In addition, this document, as the core PCR document for construction products, construction elements and integrated technical systems:
    a)    includes the rules for calculating the life cycle inventory analysis (LCI), the predetermined environmental indicators and the life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) results that are reported in the EPD;
    b)    describes which life cycle stages are considered in a particular type of EPD, which processes are to be included in the life cycle stages and how the stages are subdivided into information modules;
    c)    defines rules for the development of scenarios;
    d)    includes the rules for reporting relevant environmental and technical information that are not covered by LCA;
    e)    defines the core elements to be included in an EPD;
    f)     establishes the structure of a project report;
    g)    defines the conditions under which construction products can be compared, based on the information provided by an EPD;
    h)    provides requirements and guidelines on PCR for sub-categories of construction products;
    i)     includes mandatory and unalterable requirements for any PCR based on this document.
    EPDs for construction products, as described in this document, are primarily intended for use in B2B communication, but their use in B2C communication under certain conditions is not precluded. For EPDs intended for B2C communication, refer to ISO 14025 (see 5.4).
    The assessment of social and economic impacts at the product level is not covered by this document.
    NOTE 1       In this document, unless otherwise designated, the term construction product is used for any good(s) or service(s) related to construction works.
    NOTE 2       Construction assemblies, construction elements and integrated technical systems, incorporated within construction works, can be considered construction products.
