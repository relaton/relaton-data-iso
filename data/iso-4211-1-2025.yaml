    This document specifies a method for the assessment of the resistance to cold liquids of all rigid furniture surfaces, regardless of materials.
    It does not apply to leather and textile surfaces.
    The test is intended to be carried out on a part of the finished furniture, but can be carried out on test panels of the same material, finished in an identical manner to the finished product, and of a size sufficient to meet the requirements of the test.
    Annex A includes a selection of suitable test liquids. Annex B provides an example for a testing matrix.
