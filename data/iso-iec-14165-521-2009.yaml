  content: ISO/IEC 14165-521 defines an application programming interface (API) by
    which a storage application may perform the functions of one or more SCSI Targets
    or Initiators, and control high-performance command/data forwarding and manipulation
    facilities. It describes a set of functions and data structures in the C language
    abstracting the details of the platform from the implementation of a storage   management
    application. The series  of fibre channel publications provides a general data
    transport vehicle for Upper Level Protocols (ULPs) such as Intelligent Peripheral
    Interface (IPI) and Small Computer System Interface (SCSI) command sets, the High-Performance
    Parallel Interface (HIPPI)  data framing, IP (Internet Protocol) and others.
