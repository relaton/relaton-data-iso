    This part of IEC 62607 provides a standardized method for categorizing a grade of
    commercial CNTs in terms of their electrical properties to enable a user to select a CNT
    material suitable for their application. The method is intended to assess whether the delivered
    materials from different production batches of the same production process are comparable
    regarding electrical properties of the final product which are related to electrical conductivity.
    The correlation between the measured parameters by the proposed method and a relevant
    product performance parameter has to be established for every application. This specification
    includes
    a) definitions of terminology used in this document,
    b) recommendations for sample preparation,
    c) outlines of the experimental procedures to measure sheet resistance of CNTs in thin films,
    d) methods of interpretation of results and discussion of data analysis,
    e) case studies and,
    f) references.
