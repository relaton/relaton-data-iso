- content: "This standard specifies the safety requirements for service robots used
    in personal and professional/commercial applications. The service robots concerned,
    and the extent to which hazards, hazardous situations or hazardous events are
    covered, are indicated in this standard. \n\nThis safety standard considers the
    conditions for physical human-robot contact to formulate safety requirements for
    service robots. It includes additional information on the functional safety for
    service robots.\n\nThis standard is not intended to cover robots used in industrial
    applications and medical applications."
