abstract:
- content: The calculative and experimental methods are not applicable to settees
    and other multiple seating, nor to swivelling or rocking chairs. They include
    chairs with tilting, reclining and adjustable back-angle mechanisms only when
    used as upright chairs. Part 2 of ISO 7174 deals with the stability of such chairs
    when fully reclined. The annex does form part of ISO 7174-1. The chart gives suggested
    minimum overturning forces applicable to all types of adult chairs according to
    their loaded seat heights.
