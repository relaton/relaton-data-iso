    This document specifies requirements for the components of glued laminated bamboo members intended for structural use.
    Although currently most glued laminated bamboo is made from Phyllostachys edulis (Moso), this document also applies to other bamboo species (e.g. Guadua angustifolia, Dendrocalamus asper) if the performance required by this document can be shown to have been achieved.
    The basic requirements apply to structural members of all service classes; however, special precautions are necessary for service class 3, for example, the use of weather resistant adhesives (see 5.2).
    Annex C contains informative references for formaldehyde emission.
    The requirements will need to be supplemented to take into consideration any relevant special conditions as well as material and/or functional requirements.
