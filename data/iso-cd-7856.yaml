  content: "This document describes remote support, which is the provision of information
    or intervention in DDT to LSAD systems operated at Level 4 automation on predefined
    routes by a remotely located human in order to facilitate trip continuation.\n•\tThis
    document is applicable to RS-LSADS in vehicles that provide passenger transport
    or logistics services on predefined routes.\n•\tThis document defines the terms
    and definitions related to RS-LSADS and the system architecture of RS-LSADS.  \n•\tThis
    document specifies types of RS-LSADS, remote monitoring, remote assistance and
    remote driving under very limited conditions, and conditions when they can be
    activated.\n•\tThis document specifies the performance requirements, system requirements
    and performance test procedures of RS-LSADS.  \n•\tThis document specifies the
    data to be communicated between vehicles and RS-LSADS but does not specify protocols
    and other aspects of communication itself.\n•\tThis document is applicable to
    remote support of operational and tactical functions, but does not apply to strategic
    functions."
