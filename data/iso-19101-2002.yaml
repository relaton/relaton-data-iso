    This International Standard defines the framework for standardization in the field of geographic information and sets forth the basic principles by which this standardization takes place.
    This framework identifies the scope of the standardization activity being undertaken and the context in which it takes place. The framework provides the method by which what is to be standardized can be determined and describes how the contents of the standards are related.
    Although structured in the context of information technology and information technology standards, this International Standard is independent of any application development method or technology implementation approach.
