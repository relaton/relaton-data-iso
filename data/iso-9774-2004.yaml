    ISO 9774:2004 gives guidelines to the standards writer in selecting thermal-insulation material properties for standards used in building applications.
    These guidelines are not intended to prove the suitability of any particular product for any given application.
    The standard applies only to prefabricated thermal-insulation products, i.e. manufactured mats and boards including any facings or coverings which may be present, although the basic characteristics may also be applied to other insulation products, e.g. in situ in systems or components, where appropriate.
    The standard covers only thermal-insulation products for use in buildings within normal climatic conditions. It does not cover insulation products for building services, e.g. plumbing and heating, nor insulation products for industrial use.
    Acoustic properties are not included in the properties given in the standard, although these may be additionally required for some fields of application.
