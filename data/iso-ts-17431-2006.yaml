    ISO/TS 17431:2006 specifies an intermediate-scale test method that simulates a fire that under well-ventilated conditions starts in a corner of a small room with a single doorway and can develop until the room is fully involved in the fire.
    ISO/TS 17431:2006 is primarily intended to evaluate the contribution to toxic hazard in, and potential for fire spread to, evacuation routes connected to the room of origin in which surface products are installed.
    ISO/TS 17431:2006 is especially suitable for products with which a full-scale room test has to be terminated before the full involvement of the room with fire because of the occurrence of flashover or any other safety reasons.
