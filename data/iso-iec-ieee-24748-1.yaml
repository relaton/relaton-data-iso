    This document provides guidance for the life cycle management of systems and software, complementing the processes described in ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 and ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207. This document:
    —     addresses systems concepts and life cycle concepts, models, stages, processes, process application, key points of view, adaptation and use in various domains and by various disciplines;
    —     establishes a common framework for describing life cycles, including their individual stages, for the management of projects that provide or acquire either products or services;
    —     defines the concept of a life cycle;
    —     supports the use of the life cycle processes within an organization or a project; organizations and projects can use these life cycle concepts when acquiring and supplying either products or services;
    —     provides guidance on adapting a life cycle model and the content associated with a life cycle or a part of a life cycle;
    —     describes the relationship between life cycles and their use in applying the processes in ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 (systems aspects) and ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207 (software systems aspects);
    —     shows the relationships of life cycle concepts to the hardware, human, services, process, procedure, facility and naturally occurring entity aspects of projects;
    —     describes how its concepts relate to detailed process standards, for example, in the areas of measurement, project management, risk management and model-based systems and software engineering.
