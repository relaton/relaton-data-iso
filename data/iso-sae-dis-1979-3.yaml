abstract:
- content: "ISO/SAE 1979-3 is intended to satisfy the data reporting requirements
    of regulations in the United States and Europe, and any other market that may
    adopt similar requirements in the future.  \nThis document specifies diagnostic
    services required to be supported by motor vehicles and external test equipment
    for diagnostic purposes which pertain to Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) propulsion
    related data. These messages are intended to be used by any external test equipment
    for retrieval of OBD information from a vehicle.\nThis document specifies:\n1.\tmessage
    formats for request and response messages,\n2.\tapplication and session timing
    requirements between request messages from external test equipment and response
    messages from vehicles, and between those messages and subsequent request messages,\n3.\tbehavior
    of both, the vehicle and external test equipment if data is not available,\n4.\ta
    set of diagnostic services, with corresponding content of request and response
    messages, and \n5.\tstandardized source and target addresses for external test
    equipment and vehicle. \nThis document includes capabilities required to satisfy
    OBD requirements for multiple regions, model years, engine types, and vehicle
    types. At the time of publication many regional regulations are not yet final
    and are expected to change in the future. This document makes no attempt to interpret
    the regulations and does not include applicability of the included diagnostic
    services and data parameters for various vehicle applications. The user of this
    document is responsible to verify the applicability of each section of this document
    for a specific vehicle, propulsion system, model year, and region.\nThis document
    provides an implementation guidance based on the principles of ISO 14229 series,
    focusing on standardization of data to ensure access to important repair information
    by independent repair facilities. The purpose of this standard is to focus on
    providing the necessary content and performance requirements. ISO/SAE 1979-3 specifies
    diagnostic functionalities, which utilize communication facilities over either
    Controller Area Network (CAN) or Ethernet data links. \nThese requirements apply
    to all ECU’s that provide operational data and diagnose those components that
    are integral to provide propulsion on a Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV). In general,
    if an ECU monitors a component, whose failure directly affects the ZEV propulsion
    system, the information reporting uses the diagnostic communication services as
    specified in \nISO/SAE 1979-3. \nA government agency may have policy reasons for
    specifically tracking ZEV componentry (i.e., unique warranty requirements). In
    order to track the linkage between a diagnostic trouble code and a covered repair
    under a ZEV component warranty, provisions are made in \nISO/SAE 1979-3 to highlight
    those failures that are ZEV propulsion related. These linkages can be thought
    of analogously to emissions-related failures requiring emissions-related warranty
    repair. \nNote: When referencing other documents to fulfil this set of requirements,
    the reader should substitute “emissions-related” for “ZEV propulsion\".  Global
    regulations may vary in the definition of ZEV propulsion componentry, therefore
    the applicability of ISO/SAE 1979-3 to various components may vary from region
    to region."
