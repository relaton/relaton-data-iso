    ISO 26722:2009 is addressed to the manufacturer and/or provider of water treatment systems and/or devices used for the express purpose of providing water for haemodialysis or related therapies.
    ISO 26722:2009 covers devices used to treat water intended for use in the delivery of haemodialysis and related therapies. Included in the scope of this International Standard is water used for: (1) the preparation of concentrates from powder or other highly concentrated media at a dialysis facility; (2) the preparation of dialysis fluid that may be used for the preparation of substitution fluid; (3) the reprocessing of dialysers for multiple uses.
    Included within the scope of ISO 26722:2009 are all devices, piping and fittings between the point at which potable water is delivered to the water treatment system and the point of use of the dialysis water. Examples of devices included within the scope of this International Standard are water purification devices, online water quality monitors (such as conductivity monitors), and piping systems for the distribution of dialysis water.
