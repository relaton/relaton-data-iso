abstract:
- content: |-
    ISO 16159:2012 establishes procedures for the analysis of failures that occur during the acceptance testing or operation of launch pad and integration site facilities, systems and equipment. The procedures define the processes for investigating, analysing and identifying the probable causes of failures, and for developing corrective actions to preclude future failures.
    The purpose of ISO 16159:2012 is to provide
    - rules for investigating, analysing and identifying the causes of failures,
    - sufficient information so that corrective action may be implemented to prevent failure recurrence, and
    - a uniform method for maintaining records of the findings of all failure causes so as to provide information for other failure investigations.
