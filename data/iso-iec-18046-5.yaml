abstract:
- content: "This standard describes methods for testing the environmental characteristics
    of RFID-enabled sporting goods. \nThis document suggest methods for identifying
    the main use environments and related testing of environmental characteristics
    of sporting goods for indoor and outdoor sports with RFID and optionally additional
    advanced electronic devices like sensors. The addressed environmental characteristics
    cover the viewpoint of manufacturers including distribution and inventory management,
    as well as furthermore the aspects of consumer use of the actual RFID-enabled
    sports items. This standard defines methods to measure and evaluate the performance
    change of tags after environmental characteristic test."
