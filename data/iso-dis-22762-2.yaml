    This document specifies minimum requirements and test methods for elastomeric seismic isolators used for bridges, as well as rubber material used in the manufacture of such isolators.
    It is applicable to elastomeric seismic isolators used to provide bridges with protection from earthquake damage. The isolators covered consist of alternate elastomeric layers and reinforcing steel plates, which are placed between a superstructure and its substructure to provide both flexibility for decoupling structural systems from ground motion and damping capability to reduce displacement at the isolation interface and the transmission of energy from the ground into the structure at the isolation frequency.
