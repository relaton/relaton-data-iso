- content: |-
    This document defines print quality metrics, measurement methods and reporting requirements for printed sheets that are suitable for all classes of printed products.
    Guidance as to which of these metrics to apply to any given product category along with acceptable conformance criteria is provided in subsequent parts of ISO/TS 15311.
    Although this document is expected to be used primarily to measure prints from digital printing systems, the metrics are general and can be applied to other kinds of print.
