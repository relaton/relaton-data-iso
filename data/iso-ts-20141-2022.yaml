    This document describes compatibility for ensembles of personal protective equipment (PPE) to be used by personnel where operating situations and processes require more than one piece of PPE. Where there is more than one risk to health and safety, it is necessary to wear or use more than one item of PPE at the same time. Such equipment should be compatible and continue to be effective to minimise the risks.
    This document includes examples of interactions between items of PPE, between PPE and the operating environment and the effects of PPE on the correct functioning of integrated sensors and electronic devices.
    This document provides suggestions of test procedures to assess the effects of any interactions and identify unacceptable restrictions to safe operations.
    NOTE       The principles of this document are also applicable to assessment of interactions with other items in an ensemble that are necessary to the work and that are not PPE, for example cap lamps, instruments, tools.
    This document is also intended to be a general guideline for writers of performance requirements standards and test methods for PPE. This document can also be used by PPE manufacturers, distributors, solutions providers, purchasers, wearers and employers as guidance in PPE design and selection.
