    ISO 29404:2015 specifies content and format of the messages initiating and controlling the physical movement of wind turbine generator (WTG) components from suppliers to the construction site during the construction phase as well as for repair and maintenance purposes.
    ISO 29404:2015 is applicable to all organizations involved in the production, transportation, storage and installation of WTG parts and related components. This International Standard is not intended to be applied to substations.
    Messages described in this International Standard covers only the operational aspects of logistics and therefore this International Standard will represent only one aspect of the entire information flow.
    ISO 29404:2015 does not specify the technical implementation of appropriate IT products. It rather provides an approach based on the EPC Information System (EPCIS) standard and describes the usage of extension mechanisms provided by the EPCIS standard for the exchange of information in the offshore wind supply chain. It aims at standardizing the exchange of essential logistic information. This International Standard specifies elementary informational needs of involved parties in the offshore supply chain and defines mechanisms for the exchange of this information via the EPCIS. Due to the high degree of specialization along different offshore supply chains, partners exchanging information might require mechanisms for personalizing according to their individual demands. The underlying extendable EPCIS concept allows end users and industry consortiums to extend and to refine the information exchange. These extensions might go far beyond the basic information exchange described in this International Standard.
