  content: "This document specifies the basic methods for sampling suspended microplastics
    in water (domestic water, freshwater, seawater, treated wastewater and untreated
    wastewater), for their subsequent characterization. Suspended particles can also
    include synthetic or semi-synthetic polymeric materials (such as rubber). This
    document does not cover chemical analysis, biological (ecotoxicological) methods
    or physical methods, nor the pre-treatment or digestion methods intrinsic to such
    analyses.\nThis document covers general methodologies:\n—     for grab sampling,
    sampling using a set of successive filters of different pore sizes (cascade filtration),
    for water samples with low, medium and high content of suspended solids, and \n—    
    for net sampling using, for example, manta, plankton or neuston nets."
