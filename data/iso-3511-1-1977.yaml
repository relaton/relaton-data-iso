abstract:
- content: Forms one part of four which provide a universal means of communication
    between the various interests involved in the design, manufacture, installation
    and operation of measurement and control equipment used in the process industries.
    This part establishes a symbols system for use in depicting the basic functions.
    The system has been limited to the identification of instrument functions and
    does not provide means of illustrating specific instruments. The definitions are
    used solely for the purpose of application and understanding of the symbol system.
