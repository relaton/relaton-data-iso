  content: The method is applicable to products having sodium contents greater than
    0.01 % (m/m). The principle consists in the dissolution of a test portion, followed
    by acidification to ph value 1. Atomization of the obtained solution in the burner
    of a flame spectrophotometer. Measurement of the intensity of the radiation emitted
    at 589 nm; comparison with the intensity obtained for standard sodium chloride
    solutions, the acidity and potassium chloride content of which are equivalent
    to that of the test solution. - Cancels and replaces ISO Recommendation R 1550-1970.
