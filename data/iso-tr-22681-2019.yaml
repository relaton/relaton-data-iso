  content: This document explains the use of the two acceptable methods of reporting
    particle size, µm(c) and µm(b), that are defined in ISO 11171:2016. It also explains
    the reasons for the existence of two alternative size reporting methods and its
    implications with respect to particle count and filter Beta Ratio data.
