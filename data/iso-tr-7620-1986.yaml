  content: Intended as a guide to the behaviour of this material in contact with chemicals
    as aggressive gases and fluids, e.g. acids, alkalies, solvents, etc. This information
    is based on practical experience of manufacturers and users and summarized in
    tables. Without prior knowledge or experience of application, table-based selections
    should be confirmed by tests, where attention should be paid to the possibility
    of rubber contaminating the liquid or gas. Annex with references and tables.
