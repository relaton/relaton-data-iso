abstract:
- content: "ISO 11320:2011 provides criteria for emergency preparedness and response
    to minimize consequences due to a nuclear criticality accident. The criticality
    safety of operations are evaluated in accordance with ISO 1709.\nISO 11320:2011
    applies to a site with one or more facilities which might contain significant
    quantities and concentrations of fissile material. The extent to which ISO 11320:2011
    needs to be applied depends on the overall criticality risk presented by the facilities
    at the site.\nISO 11320:2011 does not apply to off-site transport and transit
    storage of packages with fissile material.\nISO 11320:2011 does not apply to sites
    with operating nuclear power plants or to facilities with research reactors which
    are licensed to become critical or near-critical, provided that there are no operations
    with fissile material external to the reactor for which a credible criticality
    accident risk exists. ISO 11320:2011 can be applied to such sites and facilities
    in specific cases, if supported by site management and by licensing authorities. "
