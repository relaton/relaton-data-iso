    This document specifies procedures for installing and organizing smart transportation for parking lot allocation for drivers in cities. It is intended to apply to cities, especially those having a shortage or low availability of parking lots. This smart transportation aims to provide a solution to the city issue of drivers having difficulty in quickly finding parking lots with available spaces. It also aims to address other city issues such as traffic accidents, congestion and energy consumption.
    This document clarifies the concept and goals of smart transportation by referring to the technical aspects suggested by ITU-T Y.4456[6].
