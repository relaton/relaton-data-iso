abstract:
- content: "Icons are used on Information and Communications Technology (ICT) products
    to facilitate interaction with their users. Icons can provide a language-independent
    means of communicating information to the user.\nISO/IEC 11581 recognizes that
    icons are more than just symbols used on computer screens. Icons are interaction
    objects used by computer interfaces to accomplish various purposes. Icons can
    be rendered in various forms, including using graphics, gesture, audio, tactile/haptics,
    or any combination thereof. This versatility in rendition can provide greater
    accessibility to their underlying functionalities. ISO/IEC 11581 provides a framework
    as a basis for organizing information related to the creation and use of user
    interface icons.\nISO/IEC 11581-40:2011 defines supplementary procedural information,
    requirements and criteria that apply to a collection of icon standards published
    as a web-accessible icon database. It is based on the second paragraph of Annex
    ST, Procedures for the development and maintenance of standards in database format
    of the ISO/IEC Directives - Supplement - Procedures specific to ISO. "
