  content: ISO 26824:2013 establishes a vocabulary of terms and definitions relevant
    to the particle characterization of particulate systems. It covers such fields
    as the representation of results of particle size analysis, the descriptive and
    quantitative representation of particle shape and morphology, sample preparation,
    specific surface area and porosity characterization and measurement methods including
    sedimentation, classification, acoustic methods, laser diffraction, dynamic light
    scattering, single particle light interaction methods, differential electrical
    mobility analysis and image analysis, in a size scale from nanometre to millimetre.
