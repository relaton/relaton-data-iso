abstract:
- content: ISO 22028-1:2016 specifies a set of requirements to be met by any extended-gamut
    colour encoding that is to be used for digital photography and/or graphic technology
    applications involving digital image storage, manipulation and/or interchange.
    This part of ISO 22028 is applicable to pictorial digital images that originate
    from an original scene, as well as digital images with content such as text, line
    art, vector graphics and other forms of original artwork. This part of ISO 22028
    also describes a reference image-state-based digital imaging architecture, encompassing
    many common workflows, that can be used to classify extended colour encodings
    into a number of different image states. However, this part of ISO 22028 does
    not specify any particular workflow(s) that are to be used for digital photography
    and/or graphic technology applications.
