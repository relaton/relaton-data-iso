    This document specifies the principles and provides guidelines for determining the fracture toughness of plastics in the crack-opening mode (Mode I) by a linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEMF) approach, at load-point displacement rates of up to 1 m/s. It supplements ISO 13586 so as to extend its applicability to loading rates somewhat higher than is the case in the scope of the latter document.
    Fracture testing at high loading rates presents special problems because of the presence of dynamic effects: vibrations in the test system producing oscillations in the recorded quantities, and inertial loads producing forces on the test specimen different from the forces sensed by the test fixture. These effects need either to be controlled and, if possible, reduced by appropriate action, or else to be taken into account through proper analysis of the measured data.
    The relative importance of such effects increases with increasing testing rate (decreasing test duration). At speeds of less than 0,1 m/s (loading times of greater than 10 ms) the dynamic effects may be negligible and the testing procedure given in ISO 13586 can be applied as it stands. At speeds approaching 1 m/s (loading times of the order of 1 ms) the dynamic effects may become significant but still controllable. The procedure given in ISO 13586 can still be used though with some provisos and these are contemplated in this document. At speeds of several meters per second and higher (loading times markedly shorter than 1 ms) the dynamic effects become dominant, and different approaches to fracture toughness determination are required, which are outside the scope of this document.
    The general principles, methods and rules given in ISO 13586 for fracture testing at low loading rates remain valid except where expressly stated otherwise in this document.
    The methods are suitable for use with the same range of materials as covered by ISO 13586, i.e.
    —          rigid and semi-rigid thermoplastic moulding, extrusion and casting materials;
    —          rigid and semi-rigid thermosetting moulding and casting materials;
    and their compounds containing fibres ≤ 7,5mm in length.
    In general, fibres 0,1 mm to 7,5 mm in length are known to cause heterogeneity and anisotropy, especially significant in the fracture processes. Therefore, in parallel with Annex B of ISO 13586:2018, where relevant Annex C of this document offers some guidelines to extend the application of the same testing procedure, with some reservations, to rigid and semi-rigid thermoplastic or thermosetting plastics containing such short fibres.
    Although the dynamic effects occurring at high loading rates are largely dependent on the material tested as well as on the test equipment and test geometry used, the guidelines given here are valid in general, irrespective of test equipment, test geometry and material tested.
    The same restrictions as to linearity of the load-displacement diagram, specimen size and notch tip sharpness apply as for ISO 13586.
