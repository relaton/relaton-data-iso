  content: "The proposed revision of ISO 16739-1:2018 focusses on additions to the
    data schema and reference data to further support the infrastructure domains,
    particularly for bridges, roads, rails, ports and waterways and common foundations,
    such as alignment, terrain, strata and earthworks.  \n\nThe scope of the proposed
    revision is in line with the overall scope mention of ISO 16739-1:2018 “to include
    data definitions for infrastructure assets over their life cycle as well”. The
    general scope and title of ISO 16739 being an international standard for “data
    sharing in the construction and facility management industries” remains valid."
