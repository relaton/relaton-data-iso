    This document specifies a cloud AC based wireless local area network (WLAN) networking architecture, defines the cloud access controller dispatch platform (CADP) operating mechanism and the interaction between the network elements such as CADPs, access points (APs), cloud access controllers (ACs) and the WLAN network management system (NMS), and specifies the main functional requirements of each network element.
    This document applies to public WLAN networking scenarios.
