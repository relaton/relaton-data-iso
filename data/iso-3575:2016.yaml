    ISO 3575:2016 is applicable to the requirements for steel sheet, in coils and cut lengths, metallic-coated by the continuous hot-dip process, with zinc and zinc-iron alloy coatings.
    The product is intended for applications requiring corrosion resistance, formability and paintability.
    The steel sheet is produced in a number of designations, coating masses, surface treatments and coating conditions designed to be compatible with differing application requirements.
    ISO 3575:2016 does not cover steels designated as structural quality, which are covered in ISO 4998.
