abstract:
- content: "This document is applicable to pure cultures of STEC. The present standard
    describes the characterization of STEC strains, isolated from any source. In particular,
    the characterization of STEC strains described here regard:\n-\tsubtyping of the
    Stx-coding genes;\n-\tdetermination of the presence of eae gene;\n-\tdetermination
    of the presence of aggR gene;\n-\tidentification of the presence of genes associated
    to the following serogroups: O157, O26, O111, O103, O145, O121 and O45.\nThe full
    characterization of the isolated STEC strains is achieved by performing all the
    modules described here. The characterization scheme is not sequential, and the
    different modules can be implemented separately based on specific needs (e.g.
    Regulatory needs, Competent Authority’s requests, clients’ request). Alternative
    methods may be used, including Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS), provided these are
    verified according to the reference standard ISO 16140-2."
