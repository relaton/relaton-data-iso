  content: Specifies geometrical tests for radial circular saws of general purpose
    use and normal accuracy, with carriage travel up to 800 mm, gives corresponding
    permissible deviations and furthermore the nomenclature appropriate to each part
    of the machine in English, French and Russian as well as the equivalent terms
    in German, Spanish, Italian and Swedish. It deals only with verification of the
    accuracy of the machine. It does not apply to the testing of the running of the
    machine or to its characteristics which should generally be checked before the
    accuracy is tested. Does not impose any practical test.
