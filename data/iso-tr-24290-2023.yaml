abstract:
- content: "This document reports on the datasets and a data structure for reporting
    clinical and biological evaluation metrics (CBEMs). The reporting of radiation
    dose estimates is outside the scope of this document. \nThis document is applicable
    to CBEMs for external-beam radiation therapy (EBRT) modalities, but not CBEMs
    for brachytherapy or molecular radiotherapy.\nVarious types of radiotherapy treatment
    modalities are available for cancer care. Consequently, there is a growing awareness
    of the need for objective schemes that will contribute to enable the selection
    of an appropriate radiotherapy treatment modality for individual patients. The
    use of CBEMs, the metrics associated with a certain radiotherapy treatment plan
    for a patient, is attracting attention for clinical purposes in the field of EBRT.
    In anticipation of the clinical use of CBEMs, the importance of research on clinical
    and scientific aspects of CBEMs is increasing, in concert with the importance
    of establishing a standardized data format for reporting of specifics of a CBEM. "
