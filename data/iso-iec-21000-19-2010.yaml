abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 21000-19:2010 describes MPEG-21 Media Value Chain Ontology (MVCO).
    The MVCO may be used to capture knowledge about media value chains and to represent
    it in a computer readable way, concepts in the domain and the relationships between
    those concepts. \nISO/IEC 21000-19:2010 describes the following technology.\n-
    Model: the model is described in Clause 6, by way of a narrative description of
    the Value Chain, its main elements and relations.\n- Representation: the MVCO
    has been formalised as a normative OWL Ontology, and the description of which
    is given in this Clause. The description consists of listing the classes, the
    object properties, the datatype properties, and the class individuals. Classes
    are described by giving the name, an English definition, the class hierarchy,
    and the restrictions imposed on the class. The representation is given in Clause
    7. Annex B contains the normative OWL (XML/RDF) comprising the entire semantics
    of the elements in the model.\n- Ontology use: an Informative section is provided
    with non normative descriptions of use, extensions and an API (Annex A)."
