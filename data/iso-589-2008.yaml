abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: ISO 589:2008 describes two methods for determination of the total moisture
    content of hard coals, a two-stage method and a single-stage method. For either
    method there is a choice between drying in air and drying in a nitrogen atmosphere.
    Depending on the coal rank, there may be systematic differences between the results
    obtained by drying in the different atmospheres on subsamples of a sample. Drying
    in a nitrogen atmosphere is suitable for all hard coals, while drying in air is
    only suitable for hard coals not susceptible to oxidation.
