- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "ISO 14229-1:2013 specifies data link independent requirements of diagnostic
    services, which allow a diagnostic tester (client) to control diagnostic functions
    in an on-vehicle Electronic Control Unit (ECU, server) such as an electronic fuel
    injection, automatic gear box, anti-lock braking system, etc. connected to a serial
    data link embedded in a road vehicle. \nIt specifies generic services, which allow
    the diagnostic tester (client) to stop or to resume non-diagnostic message transmission
    on the data link. \nISO 14229-1:2013 does not apply to non-diagnostic message
    transmission on the vehicle's communication data link between two ECUs. However,
    it does not restrict an in-vehicle on-board tester (client) implementation in
    an ECU in order to utilize the diagnostic services on the vehicle's communication
    data link to perform bidirectional diagnostic data exchange.\nISO 14229-1:2013
    does not specify any implementation requirements."
