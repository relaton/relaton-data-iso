    ISO 5130:2007 specifies a test procedure, environment and instrumentation for measuring the exterior sound pressure levels from road vehicles under stationary condition, providing a continuous measure of the sound pressure level over a range of engine speeds. ISO 5130:2007 applies only to road vehicles of categories L, M and N equipped with internal combustion engines.
    ISO 5130:2007 is designed to meet the requirements of simplicity as far as they are consistent with reproducibility of results under the operating conditions of the vehicle.
    It is within the scope of ISO 5130:2007 to measure the stationary A-weighted sound pressure level during type approval measurements of vehicle, measurements at the manufacturing stage, measurements at official testing stations and measurements at roadside testing. Technical background information is provided.
    ISO 5130:2007 specifies neither a method to check the exhaust sound pressure level when the engine is operated at realistic load nor a method to check the exhaust sound pressure levels against a general noise limit for categories of road vehicles.
