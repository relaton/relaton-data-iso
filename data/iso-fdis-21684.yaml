abstract:
- content: "This standard shall be used as the basis for testing electrically powered
    air circulating fan heads and ceiling fans when air is used as the test gas. The
    scope is limited to air circulating fans with an input power greater than or equal
    to 125 W—except for ceiling fans that are larger than 1800 mm, which do not have
    a lower input power limit. The diameter of the fan being tested shall be limited
    by the minimum dimensions as shown in the applicable test figures.\n\nExclusions:
    \n• Jet fans \n• Powered roof ventilators, induced flow fans, laboratory exhausts
    \n• Positive pressure ventilators as defined in ANSI/AMCA Standard 240 \n• Compressors
    \n• Positive displacement machines \n\nOnly tests that fulfil all mandatory requirements
    of this standard may be designated as tests conducted in accordance with this
    standard."
