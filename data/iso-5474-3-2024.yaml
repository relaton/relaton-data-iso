    This document in combination with ISO 5474-1 specifies requirements for conductive power transfer using direct current (DC) with a voltage up to 1 500 V d.c. between electrically propelled road vehicles and external electric circuits.
    This document provides requirements for conductive charging in mode 4 according to IEC 61851-1. For mode 4, this document provides requirements regarding the power transfer only with isolated DC EV supply equipment according to IEC 61851-23.
    The requirements in this document are applicable to vehicle power supply circuits.
    An outlook of requirements for megawatt charging applications is given in Annex B.
    This document does not provide:
    —     requirements for simultaneous operation of multiple power transfer interfaces and
    —     requirements for power transfer while driving (electric road systems)
    but they are under consideration.
    This document does not provide:
    —     requirements for mopeds and motorcycles (which are specified in ISO 18246);
    —     comprehensive safety information for manufacturing, maintenance and repair personnel.
