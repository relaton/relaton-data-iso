    This part of ISO/IEC 8859 specifies a set of 191 coded graphic characters identified as Latin alphabet No. 9.This set of coded graphic characters is intended for use in data and text processing applications and also for information interchange.The set contains graphic characters used for general purpose applications in typical office environments in at least the following languages:
    Albanian, Basque, Breton, Catalan, Danish, Dutch, English, Estonian, Faroese, Finnish, French, Frisian, Galician, German, Greenlandic, Icelandic,Irish Gaelic (new orthography), Italian, Latin, Luxemburgish, Norwegian, Portuguese, RhaetoRomanic, Scottish Gaelic, Spanish, and Swedish.
    This set of coded graphic characters may be regarded as a version of an 8-bit code according to ISO/IEC 2022 or ISO/IEC 4873 at level 1.This part of ISO/IEC 8859 may not be used in conjunction with any other parts of ISO/IEC 8859. If coded characters from more than one part are tobe used together, by means of code extension techniques, the equivalent coded character sets from ISO/IEC 10367 should be used instead withina version of ISO/IEC 4873 at level 2 or level 3.The coded characters in this set may be used in conjunction with coded control functions selected from ISO/IEC 6429. However, control functions arenot used to create composite graphic symbols from two or more graphic characters (see clause 6).
    NOTE – ISO/IEC 8859 is not intended for use with Telematic services defined by ITU-T. If information coded according to ISO/IEC 8859 is to be transferred to such services, it will have to conform to the requirements of those services at the access-point.
