    This document specifies a reference architecture of cyber-physically controlled smart machine tool systems (CPSMT) for additive manufacturing (AM) based on the reference architecture of CPSMT as provided in ISO 23704-1 and the requirements for cyber-physically controlled smart additive manufacturing system.
    The reference architecture of a CPSMT for AM includes:
    —    the technical requirements for the smart additive manufacturing system (SAMS),
    —    the reference architecture of the cyber-physically controlled machine tools (CPCM) for AM,
    —    the reference architecture of the cyber-supporting system for machine tools (CSSM) for AM, and
    —    the interface view of the CPSMT for AM.
    This document also provides:
    —    stakeholder requirements for the SAMS,
    —    the concept of the digital thread,
    —    types of abnormality in AM, and
    —    use cases of reference architecture of a CPSMT for AM.
    This document does not specify physical or implementation architecture.
