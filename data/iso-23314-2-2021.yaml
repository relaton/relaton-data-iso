abstract:
- content: |-
    This document provides requirements and recommendations for designers of BWMS using electrolytic methods to document the risk assessment and risk reduction process over the lifecycle of the equipment, and to support its approval for use on ships by administrations and classification societies. Specifically, this document provides basic terminology, principles and a methodology to identify and subsequently minimize the risk of hazards in the design of BWMS using electrolytic methods. It specifies the procedures for risk assessment and risk reduction following the guidance in ISO 12100. Risks considered include: human health and safety; marine environment related to conditions on board; and ship installation, operation, maintenance and structural integrity.
    This document does not address the methodology for the risk assessment of corrosion effects, toxicity and ecotoxicity of active substances, relevant chemicals and/or other chemicals generated or used by BWMS using electrolytic methods, which is evaluated by the IMO GESAMP-Ballast Water Working Group as prescribed in the document IMO GESAMP, Methodology for the Evaluation of Ballast Water Management Systems using Active Substances[26].
    This document does not address risks associated with the end of life disposition of the BWMS.
