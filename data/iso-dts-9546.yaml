  content: "The security framework addresses the implementation of security mechanisms
    to achieve the security objectives as defined in ISO 23195. The security framework
    is concerned with defining the means of providing protection for systems and objects
    within the TPP system environment, and for the interactions between such systems.\n\nThis
    document describes a generic security framework that can apply to the provision
    of any TPP service, including: \n-\tthe TPP logical structural model,\n-\tthe
    definition of the security framework,\n-\tthe design principles, responsibilities,
    and functional requirements to support the security mechanism,\n-\tguidelines
    for applying security framework defined in this document,\nfor TPP services."
