    ISO/TS 24154:2005 gives the principles of operation, construction, maintenance and application of acoustic Doppler profilers to the measurement of velocity and discharge, and discusses calibration and verification issues. It is applicable to open-channel flow measurements with an instrument mounted on a moving vessel.
    ISO/TS 24154:2005 is not applicable to measurement of liquid flow in small channels or partly-filled pipes using a single Doppler-based flowmeter at a fixed point in the cross section.
