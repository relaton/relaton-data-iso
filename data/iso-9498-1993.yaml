  content: Sampling and sample preparation of similar types of fluorspar is assumed
    to be carried out in accordance with the methods specified in ISO 8868. The experimental
    methods given are based on comparing the results obtained from the method to be
    checked with the results of a reference method which, for all practical purposes,
    is considered to produce practically unbiased results.
