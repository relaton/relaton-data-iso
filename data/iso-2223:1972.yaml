  content: The method detects only the heavy metals present in non-complex form, the
    sulphides of which are precipitated in acid solution. The method is not specific
    for any one heavy metal. The principle consists in conversion of heavy metal,
    such as lead and copper, in acid solution to their sulphides, and comparison of
    the colour produced with that given by an aliquot volume of standard lead solution
    treated with hydrogen sulphide in the same way.
