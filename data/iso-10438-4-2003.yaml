    ISO 10438-4:2003 specifies requirements for support systems for self-acting gas seals (dry gas seals) as described in ISO 10439, for use in the petroleum, petrochemical and natural gas industries. It is intended to be used in conjunction with ISO 10438-1. ISO 10438 in its entirety specifies requirements for lubrication systems, oil-type shaft-sealing systems, self-acting gas seal systems, control-oil systems and other auxiliaries for general- or special-purpose applications. These systems can serve equipment such as compressors, gears, pumps and drivers.
    None of the parts of ISO 10438 is applicable to internal combustion engines.
    Schemas of typical dry-gas seal support systems are provided.
