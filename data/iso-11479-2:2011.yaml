    ISO 11479-2:2011 specifies a method for objective evaluation of the colour of coated glass when used in facades and viewed from the outside, as well as for measuring colour differences within the same glass pane and between two adjacent panes in the same facade. ISO 11479-2:2011 does not specify requirements for determining colour differences of transmitted colour as viewed from the inside or outside of a facade, nor for internal reflected colour. The comparison should only be undertaken for panes of the same glass type, composition and interior conditions and situated in the same plane of a facade.
    Specific requirements are given for coated glass, dependent upon its light transmittance and reflectance.
    ISO 11479-2:2011 is not applicable to curved or bent glass, which is specifically excluded for technical reasons.
