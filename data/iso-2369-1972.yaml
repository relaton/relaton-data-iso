  content: The method can be applied provided the phosphorus pentoxide content does
    not exceed 0,02 % (m/m). The principle is based on alkaline fusion of a test portion
    by means of a mixture of sodium carbonate and boric acid. Solution of the fused
    mass in excess nitric acid so that the pH of the final solution is between 0,3
    and 0,5 after being diluted. Formation, in a suitable aliquot portion, of the
    (yellow) oxidized silicomolybdic complex under clearly defined conditions of acidity,
    concentration of reagents, temperature and time. Selective reduction in a high
    acidity sulphuric acid medium and in the presence of tartaric acid. Spectrophotometric
    measurement at a wavelength of about 815 nm.
