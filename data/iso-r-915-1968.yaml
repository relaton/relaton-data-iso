  content: The principle is based on evaporation of the test portion, taking up by
    means of hydrochloric acid and reduction of iron(III) by means of hydroxylammonium
    chloride. Formation of an iron(II) 2,2'-bipyridyl complex in a buffered medium
    at a pH value between 4.5 and 6. Spectrophotometric measurement of the coloured
    complex at a wavelength of about 522 nm. The method is applicable to the determination
    of iron content greater than 1 p.p.m.
