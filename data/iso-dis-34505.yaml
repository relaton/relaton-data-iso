abstract:
- content: This document defines a methodology to evaluate scenarios and provides
    a procedure extending test scenarios to test cases for a given function in a traceable
    way based on the testability. This document also defines necessary characteristics
    of a test case that include but not limited to unified identifier, test objective,
    inputs, steps, platform and expected results. This document describes methods
    and criteria to evaluate the test case (e.g., frequency, criticality, complexity
    of scenario) the coverage concerning functional and technical requirements, operational
    domain (OD) and test criteria, and also optimizing of the set of prioritizied
    test cases.  This document is applicable to Level 3 and higher ADS as defined
    in ISO/SAE 22736. The focus of this document is on safety (Functional Safety and
    Safety of the intended functionality (SOTIF)), in general the content is also
    applicable to non-safety relevant test scenarios.
