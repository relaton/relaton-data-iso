    This document provides guidance on the staged implementation of Electric, Connected and Autonomous Vehicle (eCAV) passenger and delivery services, with a special focus on on-demand responsive passenger services with shared vehicles. This document aims to accelerate innovation and deliver smart transportation by eCAV, in and between cities.
    Note 1 to entry:       This document does not designate the technical details of eCAVs, including pods, which are Low-Speed Autonomous Transport System (L-SAT) vehicles. These technical details are provided by ISO 22737.
    Note 2 to entry:       This document targets on-demand responsive passenger services with shared vehicles. ISO 37181 also mentions the advantages of eCAV applications to public transportation.
