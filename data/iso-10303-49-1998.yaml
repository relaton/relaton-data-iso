abstract:
- content: "This part of IS0 10303 specifies the resource constructs to specify the
    actions or potential actions to effect a process. The integrated resource constructs
    within this part of IS0 10303 define the structure for specifling: relationships
    between processes, the effectivity of a process, the properties of a process,
    the resources required for the process, the properties of the resource, the representation
    of the process, the representation of the resource, and the relationship of the
    process to the product. When these integrated resource constructs are utilized
    in the context of an application resource or an application protocol, the integrated
    resource constructs can be assembled into a structure to represent a process plan.\nThe
    following are within the scope of this part of IS0 10303:\n- specification of
    a process; - specification of the relationships between processes; \n- specification
    of the effectivity of a process;\n - specification of the relationship between
    a process and a product; \n- specification of the steps for a process plan to
    realize a product;\nNOTES 1 - This part of IS0 10303 does not make any distinction
    between a process plan that has been executed and one that has not been executed.\n2
    - This part of IS0 10303 does not address administrative information within a
    process plan. Administrative information may include organization, date, or person
    responsible for developing a process plan.\n- specification of alternative process
    plan definitions;\n- specification of the method for realizing a process plan;
    \n- specification of a resource;\n- process requirements of the resource;\n- identification
    of resources used by a process;\n- specification of the properties of a resource.\nThe
    following are outside the scope of this part of IS0 10303:\n- definition of specific
    processes or specific process plans;\nNOTE 3 - This part of IS0 10303 does not
    address any specific industrial process.\n- process specifications for continuous
    processes;\nNOTE 4 - This part of IS0 10303 has the capability to represent some
    aspects of continuous processes. This part of IS0 10303 does not have the capability
    to represent continuous processes that require interrupts, alarms, and other messaging
    service requirements.\n- scheduling;\n- process planning;\nNOTE 5 - Process planning
    is the action of developing a process plan. The action of creating a process plan
    is outside the scope of this part of IS0 10303. This part of IS0 10303 provides
    a representation for the output of process planning.\n- peer-to-peer communication
    mechanisms, including synchronization;\n- process control.\nNOTE 6 - Capabilities
    for process control and peer-to-peer communication are defined by other IS0 standards
    such as ISO/IEC 9506 (Industrial Automation Systems - Manufacturing Message Specification).
    These other ISO/IEC standards are concerned with the communication and interworking
    of programmable devices of industrial process control systems utilized in the
    process industries. An application resource or an application protocol may specify
    a relationship between this part of IS0 10303 and ISO/IEC 9506."
