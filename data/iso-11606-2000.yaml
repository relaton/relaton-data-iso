    This International Standard specifies general requirements, type tests and individual tests for marine electromagnetic
    compasses intended for steering purposes and/or taking bearings on board ships required by Chapter V of SOLAS,
    1974 and the International Code of Safety for High-Speed Craft (HSC Code). The magnetic compasses
    specified in this standard shall apply to the ships the overall length of which is normally not less than 24m . In this
    context an electromagnetic compass is an item of electronic equipment which uses the geomagnetic field to obtain
    information about the ship's heading. This information is conveyed to the main compass (which is used for steering
    and taking bearings), to additional repeater indicators and, if required, to other navigational equipment.
    NOTE All requirements that are extracted from the recommendations of IMO resolutions are printed in italics.
