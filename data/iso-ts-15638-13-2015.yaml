    ISO/TS 15638-13:2015 addresses the provision of ?Mass (4.37) information for jurisdictional control and enforcement' and specifies the form and content of such data required to support such systems and access methods (4.3) to that data.
    The Scope of this part of ISO 15638 is to provide specifications (4.50) for common communications and data exchange aspects of the application service (4.6) Mass (4.37) information for jurisdictional control and enforcement that a regulator (4.44) may elect to require or support as an option, including
    a)    high-level definition of the service that a service provider (4.48) has to provide (the service definition describes common service elements but does not define the detail of how such an application service (4.6) is instantiated, not the acceptable value ranges of the data concepts defined),
    b)    means to realize the service, and
    c)    application data, naming content and quality that an IVS (4.30) has to deliver.
    For clarification, Mass in this context is defined as a mass of a given heavy vehicle as measured by equipment affixed to the regulated vehicle; these mass calculations are achieved by dynamic real-time measurement using equipment especially installed for this purpose to measure the ?mass' impact on the road surface; it is, by definition, a service that can only be available to regulated vehicles that are especially equipped" (4.37).
    The definition of what comprises a ?regulated' service is regarded as an issue for National decision, and may vary from jurisdiction (4.34) to jurisdiction. This deliverable does not impose any requirements on nations in respect of which services for regulated vehicles jurisdictions will require, or support as an option, but provides standardised sets of requirements descriptions for identified services to enable consistent and cost-efficient implementations where instantiated.
    ISO/TS 15638-13:2015 is not a substitute for general electronic fee collection system which, where applied normally need to accord to International EFC Standards in preference to this specification. The Scope of this part of ISO 15638 is limited to the imposition of control and enforcement measures for regulated commercial freight vehicles related to measurement of the Mass (4.37) on board the vehicle.
    ISO/TS 15638-13:2015 has been developed for use in the context of regulated commercial freight vehicles [hereinafter, referred to as ?regulated vehicles' (4.43)]. There is nothing however to prevent a jurisdiction extending or adapting the scope to include other types of regulated vehicles, as it deems appropriate.
