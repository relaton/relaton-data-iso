abstract:
- content: |-
    ISO/TS 18683:2015 gives guidance on the minimum requirements for the design and operation of the LNG bunkering facility, including the interface between the LNG supply facilities and receiving ship as shown in Figure 1.
    ISO/TS 18683:2015 provides requirements and recommendations for operator and crew competency training, for the roles and responsibilities of the ship crew and bunkering personnel during LNG bunkering operations, and the functional requirements for equipment necessary to ensure safe LNG bunkering operations of LNG fuelled ships.
    ISO/TS 18683:2015 is applicable to bunkering of both seagoing and inland trading vessels. It covers LNG bunkering from shore or ship LNG supply facilities, as shown in Figure 1 and described in Clause 4, and addresses all operations required such as inerting, gassing up, cooling down, and loading.
