  content: ISO 22029:2003 presents a simple format for the exchange of digital spectral
    data that has been designated as an EMSA/MAS standard. This format is readable
    by both humans and computers and is suitable for transmission through various
    electronic networks (BITNET, ARPANET), the phone system (with modems) or on physical
    computer storage devices (such as floppy disks). The format is not tied to any
    one computer, programming language or computer operating system.
