abstract:
- content: This document gives a method for determination of the apparent growth direction
    of nanocrystals by transmission electron microscopy. This method is applicable
    to all kinds of wire-like crystalline materials synthetized by various methods.
    This document can also guide in determining an axis direction of the second-phase
    particles in steels, alloys, or other materials. The applicable diameter or width
    of the crystals to be tested is in the range of tens to one hundred nanometres,
    depending on the accelerating voltage of the transmission electron microscope
    (TEM) and the material itself. Position, which is curved, twisted, and folded,
    to determine the apparent growth direction, should not be used.
