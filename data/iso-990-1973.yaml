  content: 'Method for determination of the titre, conventionally expressed as percentages
    by mass of KOH. There are three ways: a) total alkalinity, b) caustic alkalinity
    corresponding to the total alkalinity less the alkalinity due to carbonates and
    c) actual potassium hydroxide corresponding to the total alkalinity less the alkalinity
    due to carbonates and any hydroxide which may be present. The principle consists
    in titration of the total alkalinity with standard volumetric hydrochloric acid
    solution in the presence of methyl orange as indicator. Calculation of the three
    amounts a), b), and c). - Replaces ISO Recommendation R 990-1969.'
