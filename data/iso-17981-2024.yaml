abstract:
- content: "This document describes internal and external interfaces of CubeSat. The
    internal interface includes the interface between components and the interface
    between a CubeSat platform and a mission payload. The external interface is limited
    to the umbilical connectors, i.e. access port. The document also describes the
    items to be included in the datasheet of the CubeSat components and platforms.
    The datasheet requirements apply to catalogued commercial products ready for sale.
    \nThis document does not cover the interface between CubeSat and its deployer,
    i.e. POD. \nThis document is applicable to CubeSats of all sizes."
