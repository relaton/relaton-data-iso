abstract:
- content: This project proposes the development of a new International Standard that
    defines Failure Reporting, Analysis, and Corrective Action (FRACA) process requirements.
    This new International Standard will require an organization, group, or individual
    to apply a closed-loop FRACA process that is capable of effectively managing the
    failure risks and issues associated with its products. In addition, this new International
    Standard shall require the supplier at all times make reports available in the
    public domain, that show the estimated operational MTBCF of each of its products,
    along with descriptions of the failure data collection methodology and failure
    root cause and corrective action (RCCA) methodology used to obtain those estimates,
    or reference the standard forms of those two methodologies as defined in Annex
    D, Sections D.1 and D.3 in this new International Standard. This new International
    Standard will be developed within the SC 14/WG5.
