abstract:
- content: "Unique identification can occur at many different levels in the supply
    chain, at the transport unit, at the item level, and elsewhere. Such distinct
    entities are often handled by several parties: the sender, the receiver, one or
    more carriers, customs authorities, etc. Each of these parties must be able to
    identify and trace the item so that reference can be made to associated information
    such as address, order number, contents of the item, weight, sender, batch or
    lot number, etc. There are considerable benefits if the identity of the item is
    common between all the relevant parties. \nISO/IEC 15459-2:2006 specifies the
    procedural requirements to maintain a non-significant, unique identifier for item
    management applications, and outlines the obligations of the Registration Authority
    and Issuing Agencies.\nISO/IEC 15459-2:2006 excludes those items where ISO has
    designated Maintenance Agencies or Registration Authorities to provide identification
    schemes. It does not apply to\n- freight containers, because their unique coding
    is specified in ISO 6346, Freight containers -- Coding, identification and marking;
    \n- vehicles, because their unique identification is specified in ISO 3779, Road
    vehicles -- Vehicle identification number (VIN) -- Content and structure; \n-
    car radios, because their unique identification is specified in ISO 10486, Passenger
    cars -- Car radio identification number (CRIN).\nThe exclusion also applies to
    ISO 2108, Information and documentation -- International standard book number
    (ISBN) and ISO 3297, Information and documentation -- International standard serial
    number (ISSN). \nNOTE The scope of each of ISO 2108 and ISO 3297 identifies the
    title rather than the individual copy of a book or periodical. As such, the level
    of identification achieved is at a level higher than the unique identity required
    to be compliant with ISO/IEC 15459-2:2006."
