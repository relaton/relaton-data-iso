abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: ISO/ASTM 51431:2005 outlines the installation qualification program for
    an irradiator and the dosimetric procedures to be followed during operational
    qualification, performance qualification and routine processing in facilities
    that process food with high-energy electrons and X-rays (bremsstrahlung) to ensure
    that the product has been treated within a predetermined range of absorbed dose.
    Other procedures related to operational qualification, performance qualification
    and routine processing that may influence absorbed dose in the product are also
    discussed. Information about effective or regulatory dose limits for food products,
    and appropriate energy limits for electron beams used directly or to generate
    X-rays is not within the scope of this practice (see ASTM Guides F 1355, F 1356,
    F 1736, and F 1885).
