abstract:
- content: 'ISO 18872:2007 specifies procedures for determining the tensile properties
    of moulding and extrusion plastics over a wide range of strain rate, including
    high rates appropriate to impact-loading situations. Properties are determined
    through a combination of measurements at low and moderate strain rates, the use
    of mathematical functions to model these results, the rate-dependence of parameters
    and the determination of parameters at high strain rates by extrapolation. Tensile
    properties at high strain rates are then derived by calculation. In this way,
    the experimental problems and associated errors with the measurement of properties
    at high rates are avoided. '
