- content: |-
    ISO 8858-2:2004 sets out a laboratory sequential procedure for the froth flotation testing of fine coal, e.g. coal having a particle size of less than 0,5 mm. The procedure provides a means of evaluating for a coal the flotation characteristics (expressed as a yield/ash relationship) that may be expected from the froth flotation process.
    Pulp samples that cannot be dewatered without the use of heat or chemical additives are not covered by this part of ISO 8858; nor does it cover procedures for the investigation of flotation kinetics.
    The test is not intended to provide plant design data.
