  content: This document specifies the substrate conditions and testing of the modulation
    period (including the principles for low-angle X-ray methods, the requirements
    of the coatings, the requirements for X-ray measuring apparatus, the calibration
    of apparatus and samples, and the testing conditions and calculation process)
    of nano-multilayer coatings by low-angle X-ray methods including X-ray reflectivity
    (XRR) and glancing incident X-ray diffraction (GIXRD).
