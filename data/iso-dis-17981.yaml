abstract:
- content: This document describes internal and external interface of CubeSat. The
    internal interface includes the interface between components and the interface
    between a CubeSat platform and a mission payload. The external interface is limited
    to the umbilical connectors, i.e. access port. The document also describes the
    items to be included in the datasheet of the CubeSat components and platforms.
    The datasheet requirements apply to catalogued commercial products ready for sale.
    The interface between CubeSat and its deployer, i.e. POD, is not included in the
    scope. This document is applicable to all sizes of CubeSats.
