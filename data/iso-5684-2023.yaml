abstract:
- content: |-
    This document specifies a reference method for the determination of volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions into indoor air from floor covering adhesives and products used for flooring installation. This method is applicable to determine volatile organic compounds, semi-volatile organic compounds, and volatile aldehydes. It is based on the use of a test chamber and subsequent analysis of an air sample for organic compounds by GC-MS respectively HPLC.
    The main purpose of the test procedure is to obtain relevant performance data for the classification of flooring adhesives and products used for the installation of floor coverings with respect to low VOC emissions during the use phase of the flooring.
    NOTE 1:  This document describes the overall procedure and makes use of existing standards mainly by normative reference, complemented when necessary with additional or modified normative requirements.
    NOTE 2: No conclusions about occupational health and safety can be drawn from the testing and/or the classification of products according to this standard.
