    ISO 16333:2011 specifies a tilt-table test method for estimating the steady-state rollover threshold of a heavy commercial vehicle or bus, i.e. the maximum lateral acceleration that the test vehicle could sustain in steady-state turning without rolling over.
    ISO 16333:2011 is applicable to complete roll units/combinations of roll-coupled vehicle units, e.g. single-unit vehicles, tractor semitrailer combinations, articulated buses, full trailers, B-train combinations, of commercial vehicles, commercial vehicle combinations, buses or articulated buses as defined in ISO 3833, and under Categories M3, N2, N3, O3 and O4 of ECE and EC vehicle regulations (trucks and trailers with maximum weights above 3,5 t and buses and articulated buses with maximum weights above 5 t).
    ISO 16333:2011 does not cover transient, vibratory or dynamic rollover situations; nor does it consider the influences of dynamic stability control systems. Furthermore, the quality of the estimate of the steady-state rollover threshold provided by the test method decreases as the tilt angle required to produce rollover increases. Even so, the results for heavy vehicles with high rollover thresholds can be used for comparing their relative steady-state roll stability.
