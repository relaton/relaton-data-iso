    ISO 9076-2:2008 specifies the principal responsibilities of the installers of mineral-wool loose-fill thermal insulation products for buildings. A product is manufactured and packaged according to ISO 9076-1 and then installed in ventilated roof spaces as described in ISO 9774 is assured of having the properties declared by the manufacturer.
    ISO 9076-2:2008 gives the principal responsibilities of the installer in the installation of the product, in the documentation of the installation and in the declaration that all requirements of ISO 9076:2008 have been met.
    ISO 9076-2:2008 does not specify the fitness of the product for the intended use beyond those aspects relating to installation. Many aspects relating to the fitness for use are specified in government regulations. It is necessary that the installer ensure, when installing the product, that the product installed is suitable for the application, based on the government regulations and the manufacturer's recommendations.
    The installer can be required to meet ancillary (additional) requirements specified in local regulations or by the customer.
