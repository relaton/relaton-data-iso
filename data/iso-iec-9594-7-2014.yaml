- content: |-
    ISO/IEC 9594 has been produced to facilitate the interconnection of information processing systems to provide directory services. A set of such systems, together with the directory information that they hold, can be viewed as an integrated whole, called the Directory. The information held by the Directory, collectively known as the Directory Information Base (DIB), is typically used to facilitate communication between, with or about objects such as application entities, people, terminals and distribution lists.
    ISO/IEC 9594-7:2014 defines a number of selected object classes and name forms which may be found useful across a range of applications of the Directory. An object class definition specifies the attribute types which are relevant to the objects of that class. A name form definition specifies the attributes to be used in forming names for the objects of a given class.
