    This document specifies the performance test method of electrically driven low-pressure air compressor packages, where the compression is performed by positive displacement or dynamic compression; utilising atmospheric air as the compression gas. Low-pressure air compressor packages are often referred to as “blowers”.
    NOTE            Throughout this document, the term ‘low-pressure compressor’ is used to describe a low-pressure air compressor (“blower”) package
    Low-pressure compressors with and without means of controlling flow (control may be electrical (e.g. with a variable frequency drive) or mechanical or both) are covered.
    This document applies to low-pressure compressors meeting all the following limits:
    —     Atmospheric inlet air pressure between 0,5 bar and 1,1 bar.
    —     Discharge vs inlet pressure differential between 0,1 bar and 2,5 bar.
    —     Discharge vs inlet pressure ratio between 1,1 and 3,5.
    This document is not applicable to:
    —     positive displacement low-pressure compressors with a liquid in the compression element (such as liquid ring pumps and liquid injected low-pressure compressor of screw type)
    —     multi-stage low-pressure compressors other than multistage centrifugal compressors comprised of multiple, identical or very similar uncooled sections along a single shaft (repeating stages).
    —     single shaft, multistage centrifugal compressors are treated from the point of measurement and calculation as a single stage
