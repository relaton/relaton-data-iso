    ISO 10303-216:2003 specifies the scope and information requirements for the exchange of ship moulded form definitions, geometric representations, and related hydrostatic properties.
    The following are within the scope of ISO 10303-216:2003:
    - definition of moulded form geometry related to commercial and naval ships;
    - definition of moulded form geometry of the preliminary design, detailed design, and production stages of the life cycle of a ship;
    - definition of moulded form geometry that describe the hull moulded form of the ship, including mono hullforms, multi-hullforms, the bulbous bow, transom stern, thruster tunnels, and additional appendages;
    - definition of moulded form geometry that describe the moulded form of propellers and rudders;
    - definition of moulded geometry that describe the moulded form of decks including camber and sheer;
    - definition of moulded geometry of internal ship compartment boundaries and the moulded form geometry of ship structural and non-structural elements;
    - definition of general characteristics;
    - definition of design parameters for the ship hull, bulbous bow, propeller, rudder, and appendages that are necessary to describe the moulded form, and are required to calculate hydrostatic properties;
    - definition of hydrostatic properties of the ship moulded form that depend on the draught of the ship;
    - definition of global and local co-ordinate systems and spacing tables used in naval architecture for position purposes;
    - shape definition of ship moulded forms that use one of the following specified types of geometric representation:
    - geometric representations containing geometric elements used in naval architecture;
    - version control and approval of moulded forms and related hydrostatics.
    The following are outside the scope of ISO 10303-216:2003:
    - product definition data related to hull plating defined on the moulded form;
    - product definition data related to ship compartmentation and ship arrangements;
    - product definition data related to ship structures and ship assemblies;
    - product definition data related to ship machinery and ship superstructures;
    - mechanical systems and material aspects of propellers, rudders and control surfaces;
    - product definition data from the decommissioning stage of the ship life cycle;
    - hydromechanic properties of the ship;
    - damage stability properties of ships;
    - ship longitudinal strength.
