  content: This document facilitates an understanding of the Ubiquitous Public Access
    (UPA) context information model, as defined in ISO 19154, to establish a UPA-to-Geographic
    Information (GI) environment. In addition, this document illustrates how the UPA
    context information model is designed and implemented to provide an air quality
    information service from a geographic information system (GIS)-based air quality
    information system. The UPA context information model for air quality information
    is only a sample of all possible examples to realize the UPA-to-GI that could
    satisfy the requirements of ISO 19154.
