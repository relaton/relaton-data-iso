- content: |-
    This document defines a set of software product assurance requirements in terms of processes and products to be used for the development, maintenance and operation of software for space systems. It provides a uniform basis for defining the software product assurance activities to be applied and maintained throughout the whole software life cycle, from project conception until the software retirement.
    This document mainly applies to the space software segment and critical software of ground software segment (e.g. the software which is directly interface to the space segment).
