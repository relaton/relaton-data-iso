abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 29341-18-3:2011(E) includes the device definition which is compliant
    with the UPnP Device Architecture version 1.0. It defines a device type referred
    to herein as RAServer Device. The RAServer Device is a UPnP Device UPnP device
    that allows control points to configure Remote Access Servers. This Device provides
    control points with the following functionality:                             \n-
    Determine if the Remote Access Server is reachable from the public Internet;                                                     \n-
    Enable a Remote Access Server to be reachable from the public Internet;                                                     \n-
    Enumerate the Remote Access Transport mechanisms supported by the Remote Access
    Server;                                        \n- Enumerate the Credentials Delivery
    mechanisms supported by the Remote Access Server;                                        \n-
    Configure active Remote Access Transport profiles;         \n- Configure filters
    for allowing which local Devices are visible in remote networks;                                              \n-
    Configure filters for allowing which remote Devices are visible in the local network;
    \                                           \n- Maintains list of registered remote
    users, and authenticates when they log in depending on their pre-configured info
    appropriately."
