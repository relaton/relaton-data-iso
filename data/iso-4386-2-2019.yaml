    This document specifies a tensile test method for determination of the bond strength between the bearing metal and the backing. The test can be applied to multilayer plain bearings with bearing metals based on lead, tin, copper or aluminium. For tested layer thicknesses ≥ 2 mm, a raw lining thickness of a minimum additional 1 mm is necessary.
    The backings are from steel, cast steel or copper alloys. The bond strength test does not apply to bearings with cast iron backing.
    The test applies to all thrust bearings and to journal bearings with an inner diameter of backing ≥ 90 mm.
    The test can be used for comparative investigations into the influence on the bond strength of various processes and types of material. In addition, the test is suitable for production control and for process qualification of bearing production.
    For non-destructive ultrasonic testing of the bond between bearing metal and backing for bearing metal layer thicknesses ≥ 2 mm, see ISO 4386-1.
