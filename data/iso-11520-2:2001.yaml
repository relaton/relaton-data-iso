abstract:
- content: |-
    This part of ISO 11520 specifies additional procedures and gives guidance for testing and evaluating the drying
    performance of continuous-flow and batch grain driers for specific grain crops including wheat, barley, oats, maize,
    rice, sorghum and rape. It supplements the general procedures given in ISO 11520-1 based on drying only wheat
    over the limited range of moisture content of 20 % to 15 % wet basis.
    Methods and data are given for
    a) determining the evaporation rate of driers when drying grain crops under steady state conditions, and
    b) correcting the main drier performance characteristics, including evaporation rate, grain flow rate, drying time
    and specific energy and fuel consumption, to reference and other ambient conditions.
    Procedures are specified for sampling input and output grain to assess changes in grain quality.
