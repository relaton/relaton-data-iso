    ISO 14696:2009 provides a method for measuring the response of materials, products and assemblies exposed in vertical orientation to controlled levels of radiant heating with a piloted ignition source.
    The test method is used to determine the ignitability, heat release rates, mass loss rates and visible smoke development of materials, products and assemblies under well-ventilated conditions.
    The heat release rate is ascertained by measurement of the oxygen consumption as determined by the oxygen concentration and flow in the exhaust product stream. Smoke development is quantified by measuring the obscuration of light by the combustion product stream. Specimens are exposed to heating fluxes ranging from 0 kW/m2 to 50 kW/m2. Hot wires are used as the ignition source.
