    This document specifies a method for evaluating the aesthetic appearance of stainless steels qualitatively by rating rust and stains formed by atmospheric corrosion. The rust and stains on stainless steels formed by atmospheric corrosion are rated by using 10 photographic standards.
    This method is especially suitable for evaluating the appearance of specimens and structures made of stainless steels under atmosphere exposure.
