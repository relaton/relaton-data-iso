  content: The requirements of MARPOL Annex V set the minimum standard for garbage
    management that apply to ships. Applicable national and regional regulations exceeding
    the requirements of MARPOL Annex V will also need to be observed. ISO 21070:2011
    applies to the management and handling of garbage generated onboard ships during
    the period the garbage will be onboard. The definition of garbage in ISO 21070:2011
    is as defined in MARPOL Annex V. ISO 21070:2011 contains procedures for the shipboard
    management of garbage, including handling, collection, separation, marking, treatment
    and storage. It also describes the vessel-to-shore interface and the delivery
    of garbage from the ship to the port reception facility.
