- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: 'The heterogeneity of distribution is characterized by the distribution
    variance and is determined by experimentally measuring the sampling variance.
    Because both the composition variance and distribution variance contribute to
    the measured sampling variance, it is necessary to separate these two components.
    Two methods of data analysis are permitted: Visman''s theory of sampling which
    uses classical statistics and the variogram method which gives a better estimate
    because of taking into account serial correlation between adjacent increments.'
