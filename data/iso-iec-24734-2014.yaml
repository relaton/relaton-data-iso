    ISO/IEC 24734:2014 specifies a method for measuring the productivity of digital printing devices with various office applications and print job characteristics. It is applicable to digital printing devices, including single-function and multi-function devices, regardless of print technology (e.g. inkjet, laser). Devices can be equipped with a range of paper feed and finishing options either directly connected to the computer system or via a network. It is intended to be used for black and white (B&W) as well as colour digital printing devices. It allows for the comparison of the productivity of machines operating in various available modes (simplex, duplex, size of substrates, etc.) and office applications when the test system environment, operating modes, and job mix for each machine are held identical. ISO/IEC 24734:2014 includes test files, test setup procedure, test runtime procedure, and the reporting requirements for the digital printing productivity measurements.
    ISO/IEC 24734:2014 is not intended to be used for devices which are not able to print on a media size of A4/8.5"x11" or for devices, which are not able to collate multiple copies of a print.
    ISO/IEC 24734:2014 is not intended to replace a manufacturer's rated speeds.
    The productivity of a digital printing device depends on factors other than the printing device itself. These include, but are not limited to, computer manufacturer and model, central processor type and speed, RAM and hard disk memory capacity and speed, software driver, version of the application being used, operating system, and the type and speed of the communication path from computer to printing device, etc. Because of this, in order to make useful and accurate direct comparisons of printing productivity with ISO/IEC 24734:2014, the same computer system hardware and software have to be used for measuring the printing devices, if, for the purpose of being directly compared one to another. For every printing productivity measurement, the basic specifications of the computer hardware and software have to be included with the results of the printing productivity measurement.
