abstract:
- content: Specifies methods for the testing of optical instruments and instruments
    containing optical components, under equivalent conditions, for their ability
    to resist the effects of simulated solar radiation. Is applicable to instruments
    that may be exposed to sunlight during operation or unsheltered storage on the
    earth's surface, or in the lower atmosphere. The purpose of testing is to investigate
    to what extent the optical, thermal, mechanical, chemical and electrical performance
    characteristics are affected by solar radiation.
