    ISO/IEC 18000-1:2008 defines the generic architecture concepts in which item identification may commonly be required within the logistics and supply chain and defines the parameters that need to be determined in any standardized air interface definition in the subsequent parts of ISO/IEC 18000. The subsequent parts of ISO/IEC 18000 provide the specific values for definition of the air interface parameters for a particular frequency/type of air interface from which compliance (or non-compliance) with ISO/IEC 18000-1:2008 can be established. ISO/IEC 18000-1:2008 also provides a description of example conceptual architectures in which these air interfaces are often to be utilized.
    ISO/IEC 18000-1:2008 limits its scope to transactions and data exchanges across the air interface at reference point delta. The means of generating and managing such transactions, other than a requirement to achieve the transactional performance determined within ISO/IEC 18000-1:2008, are outside the scope of ISO/IEC 18000-1:2008, as is the definition or specification of any supporting hardware, firmware, software or associated equipment.
    Standardization of other reference points is outside the scope of ISO/IEC 18000-1:2008.
    ISO/IEC 18000-1:2008 is an enabling standard which supports and promotes several RFID implementations without making conclusions about the relative technical merits of any available option for any possible application.
    ISO/IEC 18000-1:2008 also provides reference information in respect of patents that have been declared to the developers of ISO/IEC 18000 as pertinent and provides reference addresses in respect of regulations under which ISO/IEC 18000 must operate.
