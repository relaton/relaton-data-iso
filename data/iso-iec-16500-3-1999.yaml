    This part of ISO/IEC 16500 on "Contours: Technology Domain" describes the system functions and DAVIC
    tools relevant to the Contours defined in ISO/IEC TR 165001. A goal of this part of ISO/IEC 16500 is to guide
    implementers to those parts of ISO/IEC 16500 which are relevant for the implementation of the systems in each
    Contour and to show the relation between the various tools. Another goal of this specification is to state which
    specific DAVIC tools have to be implemented to realize interoperable system components.
    As the underlying trade-off between system component cost and service revenue may vary considerably, e.g., by
    geographical location and time, this trade-off is deemed to be outside of the scope of DAVIC and hence a more
    detailed "micro profiling" of the tool set needs to be agreed upon between the various parties involved with the
    realization of a system. An STB that is fully interoperable with, for example, Enhanced Broadcast Services within
    a certain geographical area, can be designed by implementing all defined DAVIC tools used by the Enhanced
    Broadcast Services in that area.
    In order to assist the above mentioned micro-profiling activity the DAVIC tools relevant to a specific Contour
    have been structured in the following way. A collection of DAVIC tools (sub/clauses of ISO/IEC 16500) which
    together realize a complete system function (e.g., the reliable transmission of synchronized multimedia
    information) are grouped together. The group is identified as "system function". For each of these groups an
    overall informative description is given and a table listing in detail the included DAVIC tools. For the tools
    dependencies are indicated if applicable. The functional requirements derived from the User & Market Domain of
    a contour (see ISO/IEC TR 16501) are fully mapped to the above list of system functions.
