    ISO 12614-13 specifies tests and requirements for the pressure control regulator, a liquefied natural gas fuel system component intended for use on the types of motor vehicles defined in ISO 3833.
    ISO 12614-13 is not applicable to the following:
    a)    fuel containers;
    b)    stationary gas engines;
    c)    container mounting hardware;
    d)    electronic fuel management;
    e)    refueling receptacles.
    NOTE 1       It is recognized that miscellaneous components not specifically covered herein can be examined to meet the criteria of this part of ISO 12614 and tested according to the appropriate functional tests.
    NOTE 2       All references to pressure in this part of ISO 12614 are to be considered gauge pressures unless otherwise specified.
    NOTE 3       This part of ISO 12614 is based upon a working pressure for natural gas as a fuel of 1,6 MPa [16 bar[1]]. Other working pressures can be accommodated by adjusting the pressure by the appropriate factor (ratio). For example, 2 MPa (20 bar) working pressure system will require pressures to be multiplied by 1,25.
    [1] 1 bar = 0,1 MPa = 105 Pa; 1 MPa = 1 N/mm2.
