    This part of ISO 10303 specifies the use of the integrated resources necessary for the scope and
    information requirements for the exchange of building element shape, property, and spatial
    configuration information between application systems with explicit shape representations. Building
    elements are those physical things of which a building is composed, such as structural elements,
    enclosing and separating elements, service elements, fixtures and equipment, and spaces.
    NOTE 1 - See 3.3.1.3 for definitions of these terms and concepts.
    Building element shape, property, and spatial configuration information requirements can be used at
    all stages of the life cycle of a building, including the design process, construction, and maintenance.
    Building element shape, property, and spatial configuration information requirements specified in this
    part of ISO 10303 support the following activities:
    — concurrent design processes or building design iterations;
    —integration of building structure designs with building systems designs to enable design analysis;
    — building design visualization;
    — specifications for construction and maintenance;
    — analysis and review.
    NOTE 2 - "Support" of these activities does not imply satisfaction. Satisfaction of the information
    requirements for construction, for example, would require a complete building design. This part of ISO
    10303 only satisfies a portion of information requirements for this activity. See 3.3.1.1.
    EXAMPLE 1 - A design analysis function combines the building structure design with building service
    systems designs (for systems such as heating, ventilation, and air condition (HVAC) and piping) to check
    for interferences of the structural elements with piping and air conditioning elements.
    NOTE 3 - The application activity model in annex F provides a graphical representation of the processes
    and information flows that are the basis for the definition of the scope of this part of ISO 10303.
    The following are within the scope of this part of ISO 10303:
    — explicit representation of the three-dimensional shape of building elements using boundary
    representation (B-rep) solid models, swept solid models, or constructive solid geometry (CSG)
    models.
    — the spatial configuration of building elements that comprise the assembled building;
    — building structures that represent physically distinct buildings that are part of a single building
    complex;
    — non-structural elements that enclose a building or separate areas within a building;
    — the shape and arrangement of equipment and service elements that provide services to a
    building;
    EXAMPLE 2 - Service elements include items such as plumbing, ductwork, and conduits. Equipment
    includes items such as compressors, furnaces, or water heaters.
    — the shape and arrangement of fixtures in a building;
    EXAMPLE 3 - Fixtures include items such as furniture and installed items like doorknobs.
    — specification of spaces and levels;
    EXAMPLE 4 - Spaces include rooms, accesses, and hallways. Levels include concepts such as floors and
    mezzanines of a building.
    — the shape of the site on which the building will be erected;
    — specification of properties of building elements, including material composition;
    — specification of classification information;
    EXAMPLE 5 - Elements may be classified for reasons which include cost analysis, acoustics, or safety.
    — association of properties and classification information to building elements;
    — changes to building element shape, property, and spatial configuration information;
    — association of approvals with building element shape, property, and spatial configuration
    information;
    — as-built record of the building.
    The following are outside the scope of this part of ISO 10303:
    — 2D shape representation and draughting presentation;
    — the contents of building standards;
    — implicit representation of building elements through selection of standard parameters;
    — structural analysis of building structures, including loads, connections, and material properties
    required for analysis;
    — thermal analysis of buildings;
    — the assembly process, joining methods, and detailed connectivity of building elements;
    — building maintenance history, requirements, and instructions;
    — approval, revision, versioning, and design change histories;
    — building elements without explicit shape representation;
    — bills of quantities.
    NOTE 4 - In industries other than AEC, bills of quantities are often referred to as bills of material.
