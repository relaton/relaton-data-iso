    This Standard (all parts) specifies methods to determine chemical emission rates of analyte from ICT & CE equipment during intended operation in an Emission Test Chamber (ETC).
    This Standard (all parts) includes specific methods for equipment using consumables, such as printers, and equipment not using consumables, such as monitors and PC's.
    Part 2 specifies the methods to determine chemical emission rates of analyte from electronic equipment not using consumables.
    The methods comprise preparation, sampling (or monitoring) in a controlled ETC, storage and analysis, calculation and reporting of emission rates.
    Examples of EUT that do not use consumables are:
    —          Monitors and TV sets (CRT, Plasma, LCD, Rear projector, Beamer).
    —          Video (VCR, DVD Player/Recorder, Camcorder).
    —          SAT Receiver (Set-Top Box).
    —          Audio units (CD Player/Recorder, Home theatre Systems, Audio Home Systems, Micro-/Mini, Midi Systems, Amplifier, Receiver).
    —          Portable Audio (CD Player, MP 3 Player, Radio recorder, Clock radio, etc.).
    —          Computer (desktop, tower, server), portable computers (Notebooks).
    The emission rates determined with this method may be used to compare equipment in the same class.
    Predictions of "real indoor" concentrations from the determined emission rates are outside the scope of this Standard.
