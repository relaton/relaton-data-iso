- content: |-
    This document gives guidance on the establishment, implementation, maintenance and continual improvement of an occupational health and safety (OH&S) management system that can help organizations conform to ISO 45001:2018.
    NOTE 1   While the guidance in this document is consistent with the ISO 45001:2018 OH&S management system model, it is not intended to provide interpretations of the requirements in ISO 45001.
    NOTE 2   The use of the term “should” in this document does not weaken any of the requirements in ISO 45001:2018 or add new requirements.
    NOTE 3   For most of the clauses in this document, there are real-life cases on how different types of organizations have implemented the requirements. These are not intended to suggest the only or best way to do this, but to describe one way this was done by an organization.
