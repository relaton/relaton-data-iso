- content: |-
    ISO/TS 29002-5:2009 specifies the data elements and a syntax for an
    unambiguous identifier for an administered item. The identifier is
    called an "international registration data identifier" (IRDI), as
    specified in ISO/IEC 11179-5. An administered item is any registry
    item for which administrative information is recorded. For the
    purposes of ISO/TS 29002-5:2009, an administered item can be a concept
    or concept information element in a concept dictionary. "Concept
    information element" includes things such as terminology (terms,
    abbreviations, definitions, images, symbols), assignment of a
    concept to a class of similar concepts (the concept type), and
    references to source documents.
    ISO/TS 29002-5:2009 was developed as a common resource to provide a
    level of interoperability between implementations of ISO 13584 and
    ISO/TS 22745. Its use is not restricted to these standards,
    however. It can be restricted through implementation profiles by
    standards that reference it. It can also be implemented without
    restriction.
