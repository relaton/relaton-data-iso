    The requirements in ISO 8124-1:2012 apply to all toys, i.e. any product or material designed or clearly intended for use in play by children under 14 years of age. They are applicable to a toy as it is initially received by the consumer and, in addition, they apply after a toy is subjected to reasonably foreseeable conditions of normal use and abuse unless specifically noted otherwise.
    The requirements of ISO 8124-1:2012 specify acceptable criteria for structural characteristics of toys, such as shape, size, contour and spacing as well as acceptable criteria for properties peculiar to certain categories of toy.
    ISO 8124-1:2012 specifies requirements and test methods for toys intended for use by children in various age groups from birth to 14 years. The requirements vary according to the age group for which a particular toy is intended. The requirements for a particular age group reflect the nature of the hazards and the expected mental and/or physical abilities of a child to cope with them.
