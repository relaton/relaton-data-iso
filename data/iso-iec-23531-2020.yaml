    This document defines the capabilities of issue management tools and is used to select the most appropriate one from many issue management tools. The evaluation and selection of the issue management tools is performed in accordance with ISO/IEC 20741 which defines the general evaluation selection process and evaluation characteristics. Issue management is based on the tasks described in several activities in their processes (e.g. project assessment and control, decision management, and system/software requirements definition) of ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207.
    This document is independent of development methodology or approaches (e.g. Waterfall or Agile) or lifecycle processes (e.g. implementation or operation).
