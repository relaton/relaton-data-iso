  content: "ISO/IEC TR 29181-2:2014 describes the general characteristics of Future
    Network naming and addressing schemes, including problem statements, requirements,
    design objectives, gap analysis, and development directions.\nProblem Statements:
    The characteristics and problems of existing NAS in existing network will be discussed.\nTechnical
    Challenges: A list of major technical challenges to assure that the FN-NAS will
    be able to provide solid \nRequirements: The general characteristics of Future
    Network are discussed and their impact on NAS design.\nGap analysis: Examines
    the gap between existing network NAS and future network performance expectations.\nFN-NAS
    Standardization Plan, design objectives, gap analysis, development guidance, chronological
    scenarios for future network naming, and addressing guidance are described in
    detail.\nThough ISO/IEC TR 29181-2:2014 mainly presents a list of up-to-date surveyed
    problems, requirements, and plausible techniques for Future Network, it does not
    mean that all of those would be applied to a single Future Network in common,
    since the naming and addressing scheme can be applied to the various networks,
    such as global networks, local networks, access networks, mobile networks, etc.
    If a specific Future Network is designed and implemented, some appropriate parts
    of ISO/IEC TR 29181 would be considered depending on its network usage and its
    characteristics."
