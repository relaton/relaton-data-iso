  content: "ISO 15206:2010 specifies the requirements for grading, test methods, determination
    of characteristic values, methods of specifying durability and sizes of single
    poles manufactured from solid timber for telecommunications and electrical distribution
    purposes, either preservative treated or untreated, under cantilever or compression
    loading. \nIt specifies the methods of measuring the sizes of solid wood poles
    for overhead transmission and telecommunication lines and permissible deviations
    that are taken into account for the acceptance of the poles; the requirements
    for handling and the characteristics for visual strength grading of softwood and
    hardwood poles, as well as the marking requirements; the methods of test to determine
    characteristic values for modulus of elasticity and bending strength of any population
    of wood poles and moisture content of solid wood poles; the requirements for durability
    and preservative treatment of wood poles.\nIt is applicable to both softwood and
    hardwood poles."
