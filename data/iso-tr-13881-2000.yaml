    This Technical Report describes:
    _ two classification methods (one based on calculated risk, the other on judgement of risk) which may be used to
    determine the appropriate conformity assessment system for products, processes and services;
    _ a set of five conformity assessment systems from which the most suitable is chosen when conformity
    assessment of products, processes and services is required.
    NOTE Alternative classification models may be used provided their results are consistent with the conformity assessment
    systems to be applied.
