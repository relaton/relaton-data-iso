    The scope of ISO/IEC 19798:2017 is limited to evaluation of toner cartridge page yield for toner-containing cartridges (i.e. all-in-one toner cartridges and toner cartridges without a photoconductor) for colour electrophotographic print systems. This document can also be applied to the printer component of any multifunctional device that has a digital input printing path, including multi-function devices that contain electrophotographic printer components.
    ISO/IEC 19798:2017 is only intended for the measurement of toner cartridge page yield when printing on plain paper using cyan, magenta, yellow and black toner cartridges. No other claims can be made from this testing regarding quality, reliability, etc.
    ISO/IEC 19798:2017 is not for use with printers whose minimum printable size is equal to or greater than A3 or for photo-only printers.
    NOTE 1       Application of this document for yield measurement of toner replenishment systems (i.e. toner cartridge and bottle type systems where the toner reservoir is internal to the printing system and not user-replaceable) requires some procedural modifications specifically noted herein. This document is intended for equipment used in the office space and does not apply to production volume or large format printing machines where the major cost of ownership is not caused by the consumable yield measured in this document.
    NOTE 2       An all-in-one toner cartridge is a cartridge that includes at least: a toner containment part, a photoreceptor part and a developer part (see ISO/IEC 29142‑1).
