  content: ISO/IEC TR 22560:2017(E) This Technical Report describes the concepts,
    issues, objectives, and requirements for the design of an active air-flow control
    (AFC) system for commercial aircraft based on a dense deployment of wired and
    wireless sensor and actuator networks. It focuses on the architecture design,
    module definition, statement of objectives, scalability analysis, system-level
    simulation, as well as networking and implementation issues using standardized
    interfaces and service-oriented middleware architectures.
