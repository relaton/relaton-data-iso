  content: Specifies the geometrical test for these sawing machines, and gives the
    corresponding permissible deviations which apply to machines for general purpose
    use and normal accuracy. Gives also the terminology appropriate to each part ot
    the machine (in English, and French as well as the equivalent terms in German,
    Spanish, Italian and Swedish). It deals only with the verification of accuracy
    of the machine. It does not apply to the testing of the running of the machine,
    nor to machine characteristics which should generally be checked before the accuracy
    is tested. Does not impose any practical test.
