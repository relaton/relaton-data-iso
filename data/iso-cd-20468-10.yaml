abstract:
- content: "This document provides guidelines for evaluating the dependability of
    treatment systems for water reuse. The dependability of a treatment system is
    evaluated mainly from the availabilities of unit processes composing the system
    facility to perform functional requirements related to water quality performance
    over a long period of time in operation. \nThe document specifies methodologies
    for both qualitative and quantitative assessments of availability on a life cycle
    basis by using two influencing factors, reliability as the ability to prevent
    a failure, and maintainability as the ability to recover from a failure."
