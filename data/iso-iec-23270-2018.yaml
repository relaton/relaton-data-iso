    This specification describes the form and establishes the interpretation of programs written in the C# programming language. It describes:
    —          The representation of C# programs;
    —          The syntax and constraints of the C# language;
    —          The semantic rules for interpreting C# programs;
    —          The restrictions and limits imposed by a conforming implementation of C#.
    This specification does not describe
    —          The mechanism by which C# programs are transformed for use by a data-processing system;
    —          The mechanism by which C# applications are invoked for use by a data-processing system;
    —          The mechanism by which input data are transformed for use by a C# application;
    —          The mechanism by which output data are transformed after being produced by a C# application;
    —          The size or complexity of a program and its data that will exceed the capacity of any specific data-processing system or the capacity of a particular processor;
    —          All minimal requirements of a data-processing system that is capable of supporting a conforming implementation.
