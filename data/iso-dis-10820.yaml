abstract:
- content: "This document specifies the irradiation equipment using ultraviolet light
    emitting diode (UV-LED) and optical radiometry for testing the performance of
    semiconducting photocatalytic materials. The UV-LED irradiation equipment specified
    in this document uses UV-LED having a peak wavelength of 365 nm in the UV-A range
    and is for a semiconductor photocatalyst that exhibits a photocatalytic function
    at this wavelength. \nThis document is applied to the irradiation equipment using
    UV-LED only. ISO 10677 is applied to the equipment using conventional UV light
    sources such as fluorescent lamps."
