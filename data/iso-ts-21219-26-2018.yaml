    This document defines the application for Vigilance Location Information (VLI).
    Vigilance messages are intended for in-car applications to inform drivers when they should pay extra attention to their driving behaviour because of dangerous road stretches, traffic enforcement cameras or other hazardous locations, requiring increased driver vigilance. The warnings can be presented visually, audibly, or with the spoken voice, or as a combination of all three.
    The presentation of such messages to the drivers allows them to drive relaxed, in the knowledge that they will be warned when necessary. The situation where a vigilance message makes sense can be very different. For example speed cameras are usually placed in areas where vigilance is required; the information about those locations promote safe driving and also more safety for other road users and outside traffic participants. Another example for areas requiring high driver attention are roads close-by a school.
    The information can be categorized in two ways:
    Fixed or mobile locations:
    —          Fixed locations refer to locations which are fixed of nature, such as the presence of known accident black-spots.
    —          Mobile locations refer to locations which are transient in nature, such as the presence of a mobile speed camera.
    Spot locations or zones:
    —          Spot locations refer to single points on a road network where the warning is located, with an indication of which direction of traffic is affected by the vigilance information.
    —          Zones refer to stretches of road network which represent a continuous area of warning affecting only one traffic direction.
    The local regulations regarding the signalling of speed measurement systems, e.g. fixed speed cameras, or mobile speed radar locations can vary depending on the country or region. The signalling of speed measurement systems is encouraged by local authorities in certain markets whereas it can be punishable by law in other markets.
