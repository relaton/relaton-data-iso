abstract:
- content: Specifies the determination of total reducing matter and of reducing compounds
    other than formic acid. The principle consists in oxidation of formic acid and
    other reducing compounds in a test portion with an excess of sodium hypobromit
    solution. Determination of the excess sodium hypobromite by iodometry. Oxidation
    of reducing compounds other than formic acid with an excess of potassium bromide-bromate
    solution in an acid media. Determination of the excess potassium bromide-bromate
    by iodometry. Determination of the formic acid content from the difference between
    the two determinations. Is applicable to products having formic acid contents,
    between 0,02 % (m/m) and 0,35 % (m/m).
