  content: "ISO/TS 10303-1792 specifies the application module for Sketch.\nThe following
    are within the scope of ISO/TS 10303-1792:\n- sketches as planar geometric constructs
    for use in the generation of surfaces and solids by means of sweep operations
    and other operations of related types;\n- neutral two dimensional sketches, defined
    in general coordinate systems;\n- positioned sketches, defined in three-dimensional
    model space;\n- relationships between neutral two dimensional sketches and positioned
    sketches defined by mappings;\n- the use of parameters and constraints to define
    variational sketches;\nNOTE    the ability to constrain geometric elements of
    sketches is available when this module is used with the geometric constraints
    module. \n\n- subsketches as partial sketches subject to special treatment;\n-
    geometric elements imported into the plane of a sketch but defined in terms of
    other model elements lying outside that plane, used for constraining sketch elements
    with respect to external geometry;\n- items within the scope of application module
    Geometric constraints, ISO/TS 10303-1789."
