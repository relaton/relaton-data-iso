    ISO 18639 series of standards specify requirements of personal protective equipment (PPE) specifically designed to protect firefighters from injury and/or loss of life while engaged in specific rescue activities.
    ISO 18639 series provides the principles that govern the development of incident type and/or hazard specific minimum test methods including design and performance requirements for personal protective equipment (PPE) worn by firefighters and other rescue workers to reduce injury and/or the loss of life while engaged in rescue activities.
    To assist with selection based on a risk assessment (see Annex C), type of PPE, (if applicable) and performance levels, for different categories of protection are included.
    ISO 18639-1:2018 covers PPE for use in the rescue activities for road traffic crash (RTC) and urban search and rescue (USAR), but could also include other rescue activities depending on the risk assessment.
    ISO 18639-1:2018 does not include PPE for use in high risk fire exposures.
    Similarly, this document does not include PPE to protect against chemical and biological hazards, except against short term and accidental exposures whilst engaged in rescue activities.
    ISO 18639-1:2018 describes the general structure of the ISO 18639 series, including each subsection, sets design and performance requirements for PPE and includes requirements for marking and manufacturer's instructions.
