abstract:
- content: "This standard will define an approach for using HTTP URIs as identifiers
    in AIDC systems. It does not define a new identifier system or a new URI scheme.
    Three areas will be covered:\n\n1.\tOne or more methods to structure AIDC data
    in an HTTP URI. Methods shall at least cite ISO/IEC standards 15418 and 15459,
    IEC 61406, and the concepts of Linked Data.\n2.\tDifferent methods to ensure that
    the identifiers are globally unique\n3.\tA mechanism to access specific types
    of information about identified items.\n\nDetails of how related digital information
    is managed and any access control that may apply, are out of scope."
