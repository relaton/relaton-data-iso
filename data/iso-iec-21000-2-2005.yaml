abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 21000-2:2005 specifies:\n- Model: The Digital Item Declaration
    Model describes a set of abstract terms and concepts to form a useful model for
    defining Digital Items. \n- Representation: The Digital Item Declaration Language
    (DIDL) is based upon the terms and concepts defined in the above model. It contains
    the normative description of the syntax and semantics of each of the DIDL elements,
    as represented in XML. \n- Schema: Informative XML schemas illustrating complete
    grammars for representation of the DID in XML conforming to the normative representation.
    \n- Detailed Examples: Illustrative (non-normative) examples of DIDL documents
    are provided to aid in understanding the use of the specification and its potential
    applications. \nThe ISO/IEC 21000 (MPEG-21) series of International Standards
    defines an open framework for multimedia delivery and consumption, with both the
    content creator and content consumer as focal points. The vision for MPEG-21 is
    to define a multimedia framework to enable transparent and augmented use of multimedia
    resources across a wide range of networks and devices used by different communities.\nThis
    second part of MPEG-21 (ISO/IEC 21000-2:2005) specifies a uniform and flexible
    abstraction and interoperable representation for declaring the structure and makeup
    of Digital Items. A Digital Item Declaration (DID) involves specifying the resources,
    metadata, and their interrelationships for a Digital Item. A DID is done using
    the Digital Item Declaration Language (DIDL)."
