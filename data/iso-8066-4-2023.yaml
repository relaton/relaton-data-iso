    This document specifies the requirements for rubber hoses and hose assemblies used for low-pressure application of circulating gaseous Refrigerant 1234yf (tetrafluoropropene) (hereinafter referred to as R1234yf) in the air-conditioning systems of automobiles. The hoses and hose assemblies are designed in such a way as to reduce vibration transmission between the engine room and the cabin. The operational temperature range is −40 °C to +80 °C.
    Due to the critical relationship between the hose and coupling for this application, a requirement that the coupling to be used in service be used for testing is laid down.
