  content: Specifies the geometrical tests for these woodworking planing machines,
    and gives the corresponding permissible deviations which apply to machines for
    general purpose use and normal accuracy. Gives also the terminology appropriate
    to each part of the machine (in English and French as well as the equivalent terms
    in German, Spanish, and Italian). It deals only with verification of accuracy
    of the machine. It does not apply to the testing of the running of the machine,
    nor to machine characteristics which should generally be checked before the accuracy
    is tested. Does not impose any practical test.
