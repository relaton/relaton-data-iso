    ISO 16840-2:2007 specifies apparatus, test methods and disclosure requirements for wheelchair seat cushions intended to maintain tissue integrity and prevent tissue trauma. It does not include test methods or requirements for determining the fire resistance of cushions and addresses neither the interface pressure distributing characteristics of seat cushions nor the heat and water vapour dissipation characteristics of seat cushions.
    ISO 16840-2:2007 can also be applicable to tissue integrity management devices used as other support systems, as well as to cushions used in situations other than a wheelchair.
