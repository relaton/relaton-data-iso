- content: |-
    This document specifies a video coding technology known as essential video coding (EVC), which contains syntax format, semantics and an associated decoding process. The decoding process is designed to guarantee that all EVC decoders conform to a specified combination of capabilities known as the profile, level and toolset. Any decoding process that produces identical cropped decoded output pictures to those produced by the described process is considered to be in conformance with the requirements of this document.
    This document is designed to cover a wide range of application, including but not limited to digital storage media, television broadcasting and real-time communications.
