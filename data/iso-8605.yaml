    This document establishes a basis for a specification for sheet moulding compound (SMC) used in the production of composite parts by hot moulding.
    It is suitable for sheet moulding compound with glass fibre (GF) and carbon fibre (CF) as the sole or main reinforcement.
    It should be noted that the term sheet moulding compound covers products which can be complex mixtures and which may differ from the definition of “mat” given in ISO 472.
