    This Technical Report describes how information on basic values for ignition, spread of flame, rate of heat release
    and smoke can be used in fire growth models for internal linings and other building products to describe the fire
    hazard in a limited number of scenarios starting with fire development in a small room. Other scenarios include fire
    spread in a large compartment and fire propagation down a corridor.
    The types of models to be used are:
    a) mathematical models based on fire growth physics, which calculate fire room variables, the results of which
    may be used for fire safety engineering purposes; and
    b) generalized engineering calculations.
    Sub-models can be included within the above models, provided the consistency of the whole is not prejudiced.
    The models in general are not limited to one fire scenario.
    The models should be used to calculate and describe the fire properties of building products in their end-use
    conditions. The use of models should not be limited by difficult materials, but it is recognized that some products
    may not be capable of being modelled (for example due to their complex assembly or to their thermoplastic
    properties).
    Input parameters for models are based on ISO tests, mainly those in ISO/TR 3814.
    The quality of a fire model for wall and ceiling linings is assessed by comparison with test results from a full-scale
    small room test for surface products and by sensitivity analysis on the model itself.
