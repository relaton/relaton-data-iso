abstract:
- content: ISO 18747-1:2018 specifies a method for the determination of the density
    of solid particles or liquid droplets (below referred to generically as "particles")
    dispersed in a liquid. The method is based on the fact that a particle wholly
    immersed in fluid experiences buoyancy equal to the weight of the fluid displaced
    by this particle (Archimedean principle), and if its mass force matches the buoyant
    force, it stops gravitational or centrifugal settling/creaming and the particle
    remains suspended. This implies that the density of the particle equals the density
    of the liquid. In this document, particle density determination is conducted by
    analysing the direction of the migration movement of particles dispersed in liquids
    with densities that are lower and higher than particle density. All particles
    are of the same material composition.
