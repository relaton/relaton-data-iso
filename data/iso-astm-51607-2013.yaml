  content: "ISO/ASTM 51607:2013 covers dosimeter materials, instrumentation, and procedures
    for using the alanine-EPR dosimetry system for measuring the absorbed dose in
    the photon and electron radiation processing of materials. The system is based
    on electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy of free radicals derived
    from the amino acid alanine.\nThe alanine dosimeter is classified as a type I
    dosimeter as it is affected by individual influence quantities in a welldefined
    way that can be expressed in terms of independent correction factors. The alanine
    dosimeter may be used in either a reference standard dosimetry system or in a
    routine dosimetry system. \nISO/ASTM 51607:2013 is one of a set of standards that
    provides recommendations for properly implementing dosimetry in radiation processing,
    and describes a means of achieving compliance with the requirements of ASTM E2628
    for alanine dosimetry system. It is intended to be read in conjunction with ASTM
    E2628."
