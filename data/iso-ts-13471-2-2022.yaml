    This document specifies correction procedures for the effect of temperature on vehicle noise emission, as influenced by the tyre/road noise contribution. Temperatures considered are road and ambient air temperatures.
    The noise emission for which this document is applicable is measured by means of ISO 11819-1, or similar methods such as the American methods SIP and CTIM specified in References [3][4]. It is also applicable to other pass-by measurements conducted without acceleration, such as when testing tyres and vehicles on test tracks with ISO 10844[1] reference surfaces; however, given that tyre/road noise is dominant.
    Measurement results obtained at a certain temperature, which may vary over a wide range, are normalized to a designated reference temperature (20 °C) using a correction procedure specified in this document.
