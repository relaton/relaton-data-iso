abstract:
- content: "The management of electronic transport regulations (METR) provides trustworthy,
    authoritative, machine-interpretable, transport-related rules for using the road
    network. \n\nThe scope of METR includes both rules that are relatively static
    (e.g., static speed limits) as well as those that are dynamic (e.g., variable
    speed limits, lane closures at incident scenes). However, where appropriate, METR
    is expected to incorporate existing standards (e.g., ISO/TS 19091 for signalized
    intersections).\n\nThis document defines the end-to-end requirements for entire
    METR system of systems (SoS), which is called the METR network. The requirements
    are provided in a format that is consistent with the guidance provided by ISO
    29148 [2] for a system requirements document."
