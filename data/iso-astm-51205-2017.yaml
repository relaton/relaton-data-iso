    1.1 This practice covers the preparation, testing, and procedure for using the ceric-cerous sulfate dosimetry system to measure absorbed dose to water when exposed to ionizing radiation. The system consists of a dosimeter and appropriate analytical instrumentation. For simplicity, the system will be referred to as the ceric-cerous system. The ceric-cerous dosimeter is classiﬁed as a type 1 dosimeter on the basis of the effect of inﬂuence quantities. The ceric-cerous system may be used as a reference standard dosimetry system or as a routine dosimetry system.
    1.2 ISO/ASTM 51205:2017 is one of a set of standards that provides recommendations for properly implementing dosimetry in radiation processing, and describes a means of achieving compliance with the requirements of ISO/ASTM Practice 52628 for the ceric-cerous system. It is intended to be read in conjunction with ISO/ASTM Practice 52628.
    1.3 This practice describes both the spectrophotometric and the potentiometric readout procedures for the ceric-cerous system.
    1.4 This practice applies only to gamma radiation, X-radiation/bremsstrahlung, and high energy electrons.
