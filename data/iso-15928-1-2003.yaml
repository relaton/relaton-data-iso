  content: "ISO 15928-1:2003 sets out a method for describing the structural safety
    performance of houses. It covers user needs, provides performance descriptions,
    establishes parameter descriptions, and outlines evaluation processes. It includes
    a description of permanent, imposed, wind, seismic, snow and other actions as
    well as structural resistance. \nISO 15928-1:2003 is intended for use in the evaluation
    of the design and construction of houses, in the international trading of houses
    or their sub-systems, and in developing risk-management tools for the protection
    of houses.\nIt describes the structural safety of a house as a whole."
