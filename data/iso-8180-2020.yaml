    This document specifies the characteristics of polyethylene film, commonly called polyethylene sleeving, used as additional protection against corrosion for ductile iron pipelines, particularly when laid in aggressive soil conditions.
    This film, the efficiency of which has been proved by experience, takes the form of a sheet or tube fitted around the pipes and fittings, on-site, immediately before pipe-laying.
