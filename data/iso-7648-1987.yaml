abstract:
- content: Specifies the nominal dimensions and tolerances of flywheel housings, in
    particular those which affect interchangeability with mating parts. Flywheel housings
    of size codes 1 to 4 are recommended for commercial vehicles and buses. Some figures
    illustrate shapes and reference quantities of concern. Applies to reciprocating
    internal combustion engines except engines for aircraft and passenger cars.
