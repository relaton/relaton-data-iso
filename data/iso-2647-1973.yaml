  content: The method is applicable to woolen and worsted products, at all stages,
    from raw materials to yarn. It utilizes the same apparatus and technique as that
    described in ISO/R 137. Since the method of preparation and measurements gives
    a length-biased sample, the result given by this method is an estimate of the
    length of medullated fibres as a percentage of the total length of all fibres.
    It cannot be used to estimate the volume of medullation or fibre density.
