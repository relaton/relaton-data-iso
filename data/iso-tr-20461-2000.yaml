    This Technical Report gives the detailed evaluation of uncertainty for volume measurements according to the
    Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement (GUM) [1]. It uses the gravimetric method specified in
    ISO 8655-6 [2] as the reference method for calibrating piston-operated volumetric apparatus. It has been arranged
    in paragraphs to facilitate direct access to different aspects of this kind of evaluation as follows:
    _ modelling the measurement by describing the physical equations necessary to calculate the volume using the
    gravimetric method of measurement;
    _ determination of the standard uncertainty of measurement associated with the volume V20 by describing the
    calculation procedure according to the GUM;
    _ determination of the sensitivity coefficients with an example of the calculation of all sensitivity coefficients by
    using complete equations, approximations of equations and by giving numerical values for standard
    conditions;
    _ determination of the standard uncertainty associated with the volume delivered by a piston-operated
    volumetric apparatus giving the combination of the standard uncertainty associated with the volume V20
    measured using the gravimetric measuring system and the experimental standard deviation associated with
    the volume delivered by the apparatus;
    _ determination of the standard uncertainties of measurement with a brief insight into the calculation of
    uncertainties of measuring devices according to GUM;
    _ determination of the expanded uncertainty of measurement associated with volume V20;
    _ example of the determination of the uncertainty for volume measurements.
