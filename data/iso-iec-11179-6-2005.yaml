    ISO/IEC 11179-6:2005 specifies the procedure by which Administered Items required in various application areas could be registered and assigned an internationally unique identifier. For each Administered Item to be registered, ISO/IEC 11179-6:2005 defines the type of information that is specified, the conditions that are met, and the procedure that is followed.
    The requirements and procedure contained herein apply to all Administered Items specified in ISO/IEC 11179-3. In addition, administration records that document the common administration and identification, naming and definition details as required by, and associated with, any administered item-specific details are also governed by ISO/IEC 11179-6:2005.
    ISO/IEC 11179-6:2005 only addresses the metadata that is used to specify all types of Administered Items. Others may want to use ISO/IEC 11179-6:2005 to register and manage locally defined Administered Item types that are not defined in ISO/IEC 11179-3.
    ISO/IEC 11179-6:2005 does not address the metadata that is used to specify particular types of Administered Items such as data elements and value domains. ISO/IEC 11179-6:2005 does not specify the registry's system design, file organization techniques, storage media, programming languages, etc. to be used in its implementation.
