    This document specifies general requirements and definitions for power supply bushing (fuel pump/actuators/fuel level sensor), a liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) fuel component, intended for use on the types of motor vehicles defined in ISO 3833. It also provides general design principles and specifies requirements for instructions and marking.
    This document is applicable to vehicles (mono-fuel, bi-fuel or dual-fuel applications) that use gaseous fuels in accordance with ISO 9162. It is not applicable to:
    —     fuel containers;
    —     stationary gas engines;
    —     container mounting hardware;
    —     electronic fuel management;
    —     refuelling receptacles.
    Miscellaneous components not specifically addressed in this document can be examined for conformity with the criteria of any applicable part of the ISO 20766 series, including testing to the appropriate functional tests.
    All references to pressure in this document are considered gauge pressures unless otherwise specified.
    This document applies to devices that have a service pressure in the range of 110 kPa (butane rich at 20 °C) and 840 kPa (propane rich at 20 °C). Other service pressures can be accommodated by adjusting the pressure by the appropriate factor (ratio).
