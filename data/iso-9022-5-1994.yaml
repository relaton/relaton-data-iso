  content: Specifies methods for the testing of optical instruments and instruments
    containing optical components under equivalent conditions, for their ability to
    resist the combined influence of cold and low air pressure, including the potential
    condensation and freezing of water simultaneously acting. Is applicable to instruments
    designed for operation and/or transport in high mountainous areas or on board
    or externally mounted on aircraft or missiles. The purpose of testing is to investigate
    to what extent the optical, thermal, mechanical, chemical and electrical performance
    characteristics are affected by low temperature and low air pressure.
