abstract:
- content: This document specifies a test method for the determination of propylene
    oxide and trace impurity in industrial propylene oxide by capillary gas chromatography.
    This document is suitable for the determination of propylene oxide with a purity
    of no less than 95% (mass fraction) and of trace impurity in the concentration
    range of 0.0001%~1.000% (mass fraction).
