abstract:
- content: 'Applicable to products having contents of equal to or more than 0.05 %
    (m/m) (with flame atomic absorption) or 0.1 % (m/m) (with fotometric absorption).
    Covers the formation of a complex between biuret and copper(II) sulphate in alkaline
    medium. Fixation of this complex on an anion exchange resin. Elution of Cu first
    with a potassium nitrate solution and then with a nitric acid solution. Flame
    atomic absorption: aspiration of the solution into an acetylene-air flame and
    measurement of the absorption of the 325-nm line emitted by a copper hollow-cathode
    lamp; or by photometric absorption: formation of a coloured complex between Cu
    and zinc dibenzyldithiocarbamate, extraction with carbon tetrachloride and measurement
    at a wavelength of about 435 nm. Has also been approved by the IUPAC.'
