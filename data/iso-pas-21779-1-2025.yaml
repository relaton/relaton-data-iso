abstract:
- content: 'This document specifies test methods to evaluate the behaviour of a vehicle
    equipped with an acceleration control pedal error (ACPE) system according to ISO/PAS
    19486. Those forward and reverse accidents occur during a straight-line acceleration
    when the vehicle under test (VUT) accelerates due to driver misapplication of
    accelerator pedal instead of intended brake pedal. This document is limited to
    ACPE systems of light vehicles only classified in UN-ECE (TRANS/WP.29/1045) Vehicle:
    “Category 1-1 vehicle” and does not apply to such devices installed in vehicles
    of other categories, such as heavy vehicles or motorcycles. This document focuses
    on an important part of the vehicle behaviour during these collision scenarios,
    which is the capacity to avoid or mitigate the collision especially to the other
    vehicle.'
