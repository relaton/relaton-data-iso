    ISO 5951:2013 applies to all grades of hot-rolled steel sheet of higher yield strength with improved formability. The steel is killed, made according to a fine grain practice and has a suitable chemical composition, including microalloying elements, to provide improved formability. The product is intended for the fabrication of parts requiring better formability than is provided by normal high yield strength steel sheet. It is generally used in the delivered condition.
    Because of the combination of higher strength and improved formability, it is possible to obtain savings in mass along with better weldability.
    ISO 5951:2013 does not cover steel intended for boilers or pressure vessels, steels designated as commercial quality or drawing quality (covered in ISO 3573), steels designated as weathering steels, having increased atmospheric corrosion resistance, or lower yield strength steels having less formability compared with those in ISO 5951:2013 (covered in ISO 4995 and ISO 4996).
