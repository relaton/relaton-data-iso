  content: |-
    ISO 13400-3:2016 specifies the vehicle communication interface and test equipment requirements for a physical and data link layer based on IEEE 802.3 100BASE-TX.
    This interface serves as the physical basis for IP-based communication between the vehicle and test equipment. This document specifies the following aspects:
    -      requirements for signal and wiring schematics in order to ensure physical layer compatibility of the vehicle interface and Ethernet networks and test equipment communication interfaces;
    -      discovery/identification of the in-vehicle diagnostic Ethernet interface;
    -      activation and deactivation of the in-vehicle diagnostic Ethernet interface;
    -      mechanical and electrical diagnostic connector requirements;
    -      this edition has been modified to include the identification of two Ethernet pin assignments.
