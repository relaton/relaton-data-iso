    ISO 13837:2008 specifies test methods to determine the direct and total solar transmittance of safety glazing materials for road vehicles. Two computational conventions (denoted convention “A” and convention “B”) are included, both of which are consistent with current international needs and practices.
    ISO 13837:2008 applies to monolithic or laminated, clear or tinted samples of safety glazing materials. Essentially flat sections of glazing parts can be used in this test, as well as flat samples of the same materials.
