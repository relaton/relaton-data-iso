    This document specifies fundamental information security requirements for defining, implementing, operating, monitoring, reviewing, maintaining and improving supplier and acquirer relationships.
    These requirements cover any procurement and supply of products and services, such as manufacturing or assembly, business process procurement, software and hardware components, knowledge process procurement, build-operate-transfer and cloud computing services.
    This document is applicable to all organizations, regardless of type, size and nature.
    To meet the requirements, it is expected that an organization has internally implemented a number of foundational processes or is actively planning to do so. These processes include, but are not limited to: business management, risk management, operational and human resources management, and information security.
