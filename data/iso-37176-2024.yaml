    This document describes a maturity assessment model to evaluate the degree of responsiveness of the smart community infrastructure with different maturity levels.
    This document provides the assessment domain (e.g. governance infrastructure, health infrastructure), categories (e.g. availability, affordability, safety and security, quality of service), and the criteria of maturity levels to assess the responsiveness to promote the interaction between the residents and the community by satisfying residents’ needs.
    This document:
    —     clarifies the assessment domain associated with residents’ needs in the community;
    —     provides users with standardized assessment categories to measure the degree of responsiveness of the smart community infrastructure.
    This document is intended to be used by providers and operators of community infrastructure, community planners and government decision-makers.
    This document applies to all types of communities, regardless of their geographical location and size.
