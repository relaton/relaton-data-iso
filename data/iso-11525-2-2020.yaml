    This document specifies requirements for application, inspection, training, maintenance, repair and safe operation (herein referred to as safe use) of slewing variable-reach rough-terrain trucks (herein referred to as trucks), as defined in ISO 10896-2.
    It is intended to achieve the following:
    —     the prevention of personal injuries, property damage and accidents;
    —     the establishment of criteria for inspection, maintenance and operation;
    —     the establishment of operator training requirements.
    The safe use requirements for non-slewing trucks, the interface between rough-terrain trucks and integrated personnel work platforms that can be fitted to rough-terrain trucks and the handling of freely suspended loads with rough-terrain trucks are covered by the other parts of the ISO 11525 series.
    The safe use requirements for non-integrated personnel work platforms are covered in ISO 18479-2.
    This document is not applicable to lorry-mounted trucks.
    This document is not applicable to mobile cranes.
    NOTE    National or local requirements can apply.
