abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 19831:2015 describes the model and protocol for management interactions
    between a cloud Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) Provider and the Consumers
    of an IaaS service. The basic resources of IaaS (machines, storage, and networks)
    are modeled with the goal of providing Consumer management access to an implementation
    of IaaS and facilitating portability between cloud implementations that support
    the specification. This document specifies a Representational State Transfer (REST)-style
    protocol using HTTP. However, the underlying model is not specific to HTTP, and
    it is possible to map it to other protocols as well. \nCIMI addresses the management
    of the lifecycle of infrastructure provided by a Provider. CIMI does not extend
    beyond infrastructure management to the control of the applications and services
    that the Consumer chooses to run on the infrastructure provided as a service by
    the Provider. Although CIMI may be to some extent applicable to other cloud service
    models, such as Platform as a Service (\"PaaS\") or Storage as a Service (\"SaaS\"),
    these uses are outside the design goals of CIMI."
