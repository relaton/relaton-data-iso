  content: This document provides a review of global testing methodologies related
    to the vulnerabilities of buildings from large outdoor fire exposures. It also
    provides information on land use management practices. Some of the test methods
    outlined in this document have been developed in the context of building fires
    and extrapolated to external fire exposures.
