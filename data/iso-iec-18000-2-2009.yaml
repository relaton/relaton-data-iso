abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 18000-2:2009 defines the air interface for radio frequency identification
    (RFID) devices operating below 135 kHz. The purpose of ISO/IEC 18000-2:2009 is
    to provide a common technical specification for RFID devices that can be used
    by ISO committees developing RFID application standards. ISO/IEC 18000-2:2009
    is intended to allow for compatibility and to encourage inter-operability of products
    in the international marketplace. ISO/IEC 18000-2:2009 defines the physical layer
    used for communication between the interrogator and the tag and further defines
    the communications protocol used in the air interface.\nTwo types of tag are defined
    by ISO/IEC 18000-2:2009: Type A and Type B, which differ only by their physical
    layer. Both support the same inventory (anti-collision) and protocol.\nType A
    tags are permanently powered by the interrogator, including during the tag-to-interrogator
    transmission, and operate at 125 kHz. \nType B tags are powered by the interrogator,
    except during the tag-to-interrogator transmission, and operate at 125 kHz or
    134,2 kHz."
