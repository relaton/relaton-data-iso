    This document specifies the application module for AP242 managed model based 3D engineering.
    The following are within the scope of this document:
    - products of automotive, aerospace and other mechanical manufacturers and of their suppliers, including parts, assemblies of parts, tools, assemblies of tools, and raw materials;
    - engineering and product data for the purpose of long-term archiving and retrieval;
    - product data management

    breakdown data representing a parent-child structures, such as functional, physical, system or zonal breakdowns. A breakdown is made of breakdown element;
    product definition data and configuration control data for managing large numbers of variants of products during the design phase;
    data describing the changes that have occurred during the design phase, including tracking of the versions of a product and of the data related to the documentation of the change process;
    delta change: data describing the exchange of differences with respect to a set of data previously sent;
    identification of standard parts, based on international, national, or industrial standards;
    release and approval data for product data;
    data that identify the supplier of a product and related contract information;
    properties of parts or of tools;
    references to product documentation represented in a format other than those specified by ISO 10303;
    product manufacturing information, covering the design and manufacturing planning phase;
    identification of physically realized parts or of tools, including assembly of physically realized products and recording of test results.


    - process planning

    process plan information describing the relationships between parts and the tools used to manufacture them and to manage the relationships between intermediate stages of part or tool development.


    - mechanical design

    different types of geometry models, including:

    2D- and 3D-wireframe geometry model;
    geometrically bounded surface geometry model;
    topologically bounded surface geometry model;
    faceted-boundary geometry model;
    boundary geometry model;
    compound shape geometry model;
    constructive solid geometry model;
    parametric and constrained geometry model;
    2D-sketch model;
    3D tessellated geometry model;
    3D scan data;
    curved triangles.


    representation of the shape of parts or tools that is a combination of two or more of different types of geometry models;
    data that pertains to the presentation of the shape of the product;
    representation of portions of the shape of a part or a tool by manufacturing features;
    data defining surface conditions;
    dimensional and geometrical tolerance data;
    quality criteria and inspection results of given three dimensional product shape data;
    product documentation as annotated 3D models and as drawings.


    - message

    data that identify a message and an envelope.


    - interface

    data representing the interfaces with version management mechanism and the definition of connection with connectors.


    - mating

    data representing the detailed assembly information on how the involved part occurrences are mated together and which constraints apply.


    - kinematics

    simulation data for the description of kinematic structures and motion.


    - analysis management

    data representing an analysis, managed in versions and the link to the result of the analysis.


    - composite design

    definition of composite structural parts;
    the association of the constituents of composite and metallic parts with the constituent shape model;
    the depiction of composite laminate tables describing the material, stacking sequence and ply orientation;
    constituents of the composite or a portion of the composite with a defined shape;
    the identification of material specifications from internal and external sources and their properties for a specific operating environment.


    - electrical harness assembly design

    electrical wire harnesses design;
    physical electrical harness model for design and construction;
    electrical connectivity information in multilevel assemblies;
    wire and cable list data;
    definition of wire, cable and connector features.


    - additive manufacturing part design

    build information.


    - requirements management

    verification and validation.
