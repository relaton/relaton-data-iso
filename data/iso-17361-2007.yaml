abstract:
- content: ISO 17361:2007 specifies the definition of the system, classification,
    functions, human-machine interface (HMI) and test methods for lane departure warning
    systems. These are in-vehicle systems that can warn the driver of a lane departure
    on highways and highway-like roads. The subject system, which may utilize optical,
    electromagnetic, GPS or other sensor technologies, issues a warning consistent
    with the visible lane markings. The issuance of warnings at roadway sections having
    temporary or irregular lane markings (such as roadwork zones) is not within the
    scope of ISO 17361:2007. ISO 17361:2007 applies to passenger cars, commercial
    vehicles and buses. The system will not take any automatic action to prevent possible
    lane departures. Responsibility for the safe operation of the vehicle remains
    with the driver.
