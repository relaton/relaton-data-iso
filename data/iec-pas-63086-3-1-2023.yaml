  content: "This document specifies a method to evaluate the capability of portable
    household air cleaners to reduce the concentration and viability of key experimentally
    generated bioaerosols in a specified chamber.\nIndoor air free of harmful microbes
    is important to the health of occupants. This is particularly relevant with regard
    to increased time spent indoors.\nAir cleaners are used to reduce the concentrations
    of microorganisms in indoor air.\nThe efficiency of such air cleaners to reduce
    airborne microorganisms can be assessed in test chambers at controlled air temperature
    and relative air humidity.\nThe test is applicable to portable air cleaners commonly
    used in single room spaces such as those based on mechanical filtration, ultraviolet
    (UV), ionizers, photocatalytic oxidation, and ozone generators in-unit technology.\nIf
    the air cleaner does not claim to have the function of reducing microorganisms,
    this document may not be applicable unless it is being used to simply evaluate
    the performance.\nThis document deals with measurement procedures regarding the
    reduction of the microbial contamination related to electrical air cleaner appliances
    for household and similar use. \nThis document does not apply to appliances intended
    to be used in medical, veterinary, or pharmaceutical applications. \nThis document
    does not address sanitization, disinfection, or sterilization measures.\nThis
    document does not support, by itself any health-related claims or conclusions
    about prevention or treatment of a disease or health improvement. \nNOTE 1 IEC 63086-3-1
    is created for household and similar electrical air cleaners and is not intended
    to conflict with or replace standards for commercial or industrial consumers.\nNOTE
    2 In this document, we do not suggest performance test methods that measure the
    by-products of either the interaction between microbes or between the air cleaner
    and the microbes tested in this document. The formation of by-products is an important
    subject. The subject of measuring by-products is under study, and AHAM will address
    this in future documents.\nNOTE 3 This document does not apply to appliances intended
    for use in medical treatment locations, such as surgical suites, laboratories,
    medical treatment rooms, etc."
