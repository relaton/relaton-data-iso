  content: Describes the design requirements and general considerations of this equipment
    on board merchant seagoing ships, when it is specified by the shipowner. Applies
    for normal conditions in all waters except those encountered in extremely cold
    or hot climates. Herein, pantries with cooking appliances are those which contain
    appliances consuming more than the small amount of electrical power needed for
    coffee urns, hot-plates for keeping food warm, electric water boilers, etc.
