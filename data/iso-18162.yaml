abstract:
- content: "This document specifies requirements for the biobanking of human neural
    stem cells (hNSCs) derived from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), including
    the requirements for the differentiaton, culture, characterization, quality control,
    storage, thawing and transport of hNSCs. \nRequirements for the collection of
    biological source material, the transport to and reception of biological source
    material and hPSCs at the biobank, as well as the establishment, expansion and
    QC of hPSCs are covered in ISO 24603.\nThis document is applicable to all organizations
    performing biobanking of hNSCs used for research and development in the life sciences.
    \nThis document does not apply to hNSCs for the purpose of in vivo application
    in humans, clinical applications or therapeutic use.\nNOTE\tInternational, national
    or regional regulations or requirements or multiple of them can also apply to
    specific topics covered in this document."
