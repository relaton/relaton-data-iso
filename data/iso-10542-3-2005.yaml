abstract:
- content: ISO 10542-3:2005 specifies design and performance requirements and recommendations,
    instructions and warnings for both installers and users, and product marking and
    labelling, for wheelchair tiedown and occupant-restraint systems (WTORS) that
    use a docking-type wheelchair tiedown. It specifies the universal docking interface
    geometry (UDIG) and a method of testing wheelchair movement. It is applicable
    to docking-type wheelchair tiedown devices intended for securing all types of
    manual and powered forward-facing wheelchairs, including scooters with three or
    more wheels, used by adult passengers and drivers of motor vehicles. Although
    ISO 10542-3 has been conceived primarily for use with complete WTORS, certain
    of its aspects can also be applied to components and subassemblies sold separately
    and for replacement parts.
