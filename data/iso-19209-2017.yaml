    ISO 19209:2017 classifies thermoplastic resin-based wood adhesives for non-structural applications into durability classes D1 to D4 based on the dry and wet strengths of bond lines measured under specified conditions after various conditioning treatments.
    For special applications, further tests that do not fall within the scope of ISO 19209:2017 can be applicable.
    The adhesives specified in ISO 19209:2017 are suitable for the bonding of furniture and interior structures, panelling, doors, windows, stairs, etc. made of wood or derived timber products.
    ISO 19209:2017 does not specify the temperature resistance of bond lines.
