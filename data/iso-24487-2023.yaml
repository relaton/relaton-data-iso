    This document applies to processless lithographic plates and specifies evaluation methods for lithographic plate characteristics, on-press development performance, usability and print image quality.
    It specifies measurement conditions for materials and equipment and provides guidelines for the selection of suitable processless lithographic plates by a printing organization and requirements for comparative assessment tests.
    The assessment of waterless lithographic plates is out of scope of this document.
    NOTE            Some of these methods can be used for the evaluation of all classes of lithographic plate.
    This document specifies measurement conditions for materials and equipment and provides guidelines for the selection of suitable processless lithographic plates by a printing organization and requirements for comparative assessment tests.
