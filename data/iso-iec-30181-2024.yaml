    This document specifies functional requirements and architecture about the following items for resource interoperability among heterogeneous IoT platforms through the conversion of resource identifiers (IDs) and paths (e.g. uniform resource identifier (URI)):
    – requirements for interoperability of resource IDs in the heterogeneous IoT platforms;
    – functional architecture for converting IDs and paths of resources on heterogeneous IoT platforms; and,
    – functional architecture for mapping and managing resource IDs among heterogeneous IoT platforms.
