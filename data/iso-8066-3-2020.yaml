abstract:
- content: |-
    This document specifies the requirements for rubber or thermoplastic hoses and hose assemblies used for circulating liquid and gaseous R1234yf (tetrafluoropropene) in the air-conditioning systems of automobiles. The hoses and hose assemblies are designed in such a way as to restrict losses of refrigerant and contamination of the system. The operational temperature range is −40 °C to +125 °C.
    Due to the critical relationship between the hose and coupling for this application, a requirement that the coupling to be used in service be used for testing has been laid down.
