    The MSA/MAS/AMAS hyper-dimensional data file specification (HMSA, for short) is a platform-independent data format to permit the exchange of hyper-dimensional microscopy and microanalytical data between different software applications. The applications include, but are not limited to:
    —    Hyper-spectral maps, such as electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), energy dispersive x-ray spectrometry (XEDS), or cathodoluminescence spectroscopy (CL).
    —    ‘Hyper-image’ maps, such as pattern maps using electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) or convergent beam electron diffraction (CBED).
    —    3-dimensional maps, such as confocal microscopy, or focused ion beam (FIB) serial section maps.
    —    4-dimensional maps, such as double-tilt electron tomography.
    —    Time-resolved microscopy and spectroscopy.
    In addition to storing hyper-dimensional data, the HMSA file format is applicable for storing conventional microscopy and microanalysis data, such as spectra, line profiles, images, and quantitative analyses, as well as experimental conditions and other metadata.
