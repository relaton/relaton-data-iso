    This practice describes the basic requirements that apply when making absorbed dose measurements in accordance with the ASTM E61 series of dosimetry standards. In addition, it provides guidance on the selection of dosimetry systems and directs the user to other standards that provide specific information on individual dosimetry systems, calibration methods, uncertainty estimation and radiation processing applications.
    This practice applies to dosimetry for radiation processing applications using electrons or photons (gamma- or
    X-radiation).
    This practice addresses the minimum requirements of a measurement management system, but does not include general quality system requirements.
    This practice does not address personnel dosimetry or medical dosimetry.
    This practice does not apply to primary standard dosimetry systems.
    This standard does not purport to address all of the safety concerns, if any, associated with its use. It is the responsibility of the user of this standard to establish appropriate safety, health, and environmental practices and determine the applicability of regulatory limitations prior to use.
