    ISO/TR 17177:2015 provides guidance for installations, equipment and operation at the ship to terminal and ship to ship interface for hybrid floating and fixed LNG terminals that might not comply with the description of "Conventional LNG Terminal" included in ISO 28460.
    ISO/TR 17177:2015 is intended to be read in conjunction with ISO 28460 to ensure the safe and efficient LNG transfer operation at these marine facilities.
    ISO/TR 17177:2015 also addresses high pressure natural gas (HPNG) at the transfer interface at facilities where liquefaction or regasification is undertaken, but does not describe requirements for the process plant generally forming part of the terminal facility.
    These guidelines are based around facilities that are currently in operation or under development.
