    ISO 10896-4:2015 specifies the additional safety requirements and means of verification for rough-terrain variable-reach trucks (hereafter referred to as trucks) fitted with a lifting attachment for handling suspended loads which can swing freely in one or more directions. It is applicable to trucks covered by ISO 10896‑1 and ISO 10896‑2.
    ISO 10896-4:2015 does not apply to:
           the lifting of suspended loads which by design of the load or the lifting attachments does not allow the load to swing freely in any direction;
           the handling of flexible intermediate bulk containers, as defined in ISO 21898, carried under the forks of the truck;
           any attachments/means used for lifting personnel;
           lifting accessories not included as part of the lifting attachment;
           freight container handling trucks.
    ISO 10896-4:2015 deals with significant hazards, hazardous situations or hazardous events relevant to trucks handling a freely suspended load, when they are used as intended by the manufacturer.
    ISO 10896-4:2015 is not applicable to rough-terrain variable-reach trucks fitted with a lifting attachment for handling suspended loads manufactured before the date of its publication.
