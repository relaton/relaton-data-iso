abstract:
- content: "IEC PAS 80005-3:2014(E) describes low voltage shore connection (LVSC)
    systems, on board the ship and on shore, to supply the ship with electrical power
    from shore. This PAS is applicable to the design, installation and testing of
    LVSC systems and addresses:                                              - LV
    shore distribution systems;                   \n- shore-to-ship connection and
    interface equipment;\n- transformers/reactors;                           \n- semiconductor/rotating
    convertors;               \n- ship distribution systems; and                   \n-
    control, monitoring, interlocking and power management systems. It does not apply
    to the electrical power supply during docking periods, e.g. dry docking and other
    out-of-service maintenance and repair. It is expected that LVSC systems will have
    practicable applications for ships requiring up to 1 MVA. Low-voltage shore connection
    systems not exceeding 250 A, with a maximum of 125 A per cable and not exceeding
    300 V to earth are not covered by this PAS. High-voltage shore connection systems
    are covered by IEC/ISO/IEEE 80005-1."
