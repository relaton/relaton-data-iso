abstract:
- content: |-
    ISO 10961:2010 specifies the requirements for the design, construction, testing and initial inspection of a transportable cylinder bundle. It is applicable to cylinder bundles containing compressed gas, liquefied gas and mixtures thereof. It is also applicable to cylinder bundles for acetylene.
    It does not apply to packages in which cylinders are manifolded together in a support frame which is designed to be fixed permanently to a road vehicle, to a railway wagon or to the ground as a customer storage vessel. It does not apply to cylinder bundles which are designed for use in extreme environmental or operational conditions when additional and extraordinary requirements are imposed to maintain safety standards, reliability and performance, e.g. offshore cylinder bundles.
    Specific requirements for acetylene cylinder bundles containing acetylene in a solvent are included in an annex. ISO 10961 does not, however, cover acetylene cylinder bundles with solvent-free acetylene cylinders.
    ISO 10961 is intended primarily for industrial gases other than liquefied petroleum gases (LPGs), but it may also be used for LPGs.
