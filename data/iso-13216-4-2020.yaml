    This document establishes the positioning zones, dimensions and general and static strength requirements for lower tether anchorages.
    Lower tether anchorages can be used together with seat bight anchorages according to ISO 13216-1, or with other methods for anchoring child restraint systems (CRS) in road vehicles.
    This document is applicable to all seating positions, intended by the vehicle manufacturer, for use with rearward-facing CRSs. These seating positions can include outer and mid positions in rear seats (second and third row), as well as the front passenger seat.
    This document also specifies requirements and strength testing of retrofit lower tether anchorages.
