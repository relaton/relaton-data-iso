abstract:
- content: Establishes the test procedures for direct measurement of the concentration
    of exhaust gas emissions from road vehicles with a maximum authorized total mass
    not exceeding 3,5 t, equipped with controlled ignition engines, excluding those
    which are supplied with fuel/oil mixture. Defines the recommended test procedure
    for periodic inspections in official garages, official roadside checks (e.g. by
    police), maintenance and diagnostic operations. These procedures may be used totally
    or partially.
