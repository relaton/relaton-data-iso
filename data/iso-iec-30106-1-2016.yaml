  content: "ISO/IEC 30106-1:2016 specifies an architecture for a set of interfaces
    which define the OO BioAPI. Components defined in this part of ISO/IEC 30106 include
    a framework, Biometric Service Providers (BSPs), Biometric Function Providers
    (BFPs) and a component registry. \nNOTE          Each of these components have
    an equivalent component specified in ISO/IEC 19784‑1 as the OO BioAPI is intended
    to be an OO interpretation of this part of ISO/IEC 30106. \nFor this reason, this
    part of ISO/IEC 30106 is conceptually equivalent to ISO/IEC 19784‑1. Concepts
    present in this part of ISO/IEC 30106 (for example, BioAPI_Unit and component
    registry) have the same meaning as in ISO/IEC 19784‑1. While the conceptual equivalence
    of this part of ISO/IEC 30106 will be maintained with ISO/IEC 19784‑1, there are
    differences in the parameters passed between functions and the sequence of function
    calls. These differences exist to take advantage of the features provided by Object
    Oriented Programming Languages."
