abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC TR 9294:2005 offers guidance on the management of software documentation
    to managers responsible for the production of software or software-based products.
    This guidance is intended to assist managers in ensuring that effective documentation
    is produced in their organizations.\nISO/IEC TR 9294:2005 addresses the policies,
    standards, procedures, resources and plans with which managers must concern themselves
    in order to manage software documentation effectively.\nThe guidance given is
    intended to be applicable to all types of software, from the simplest program
    to the most complex software suite or software system. All types of software documentation
    are covered, relating to all stages of the software life cycle. \nThe principles
    of software documentation management are the same whatever the size of a project.
    For small projects, much of the detail given in ISO/IEC TR 9294:2005 may not apply,
    but the principles remain the same. Managers may tailor the recommendations to
    their particular needs.\nThe guidance given is from the point of view of software
    documentation management. Detailed advice is not provided on, for example, the
    content and layout of software documents."
