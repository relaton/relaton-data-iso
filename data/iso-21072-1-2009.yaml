abstract:
- content: "ISO 21072-1:2009 provides a methodology for establishing quantitative
    performance data for oil skimmers under moving water conditions, so that the end
    user can objectively judge, compare and evaluate the design and performance of
    different skimmer units. The methodology applies to testing in a basin and requires
    control of oil properties and oil slick characteristics.\nThe method is applicable
    to all types of skimmers, provided that the equipment dimensions are within the
    physical limitations of the test basin. The test procedure provides full-scale
    test results for the unit tested, under controlled conditions, and for one or
    more classes of oil. "
