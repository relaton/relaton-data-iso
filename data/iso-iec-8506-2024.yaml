abstract:
- content: "This document specifies the identification, data, information services,
    application guidance aspects and applicable requirements of automatic identification
    and data capture (AIDC) technology for different items and their hierarchy in
    industrial construction during their whole life cycle. \nThis document\n—    provides
    unique identification for items in industrial construction,\n—    specifies the
    semantics and data syntax to be used,\n—    specifies the data carriers to be
    used on items of various categories, substitutes and sizes,\n—    makes recommendations
    about the metadata of the items,\n—    specifies the application test method and
    parameters based on the large-scale test and scientific sampling rules,\n—   
    defines the information services protocol to be used as an interface between business
    applications and the AIDC system, and\n—    makes guidance for designers, workers,
    engineers, managers, end users and maintainers about the AIDC application in their
    daily work."
