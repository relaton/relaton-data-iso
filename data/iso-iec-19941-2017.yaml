- content: |-
    ISO/IEC 19941:2017 specifies cloud computing interoperability and portability types, the relationship and interactions between these two cross-cutting aspects of cloud computing and common terminology and concepts used to discuss interoperability and portability, particularly relating to cloud services.
    ISO/IEC 19941:2017 is related to other standards, namely, ISO/IEC 17788, ISO/IEC 17789, ISO/IEC 19086‑1, ISO/IEC 19944, and in particular, references the cross-cutting aspects and components identified in ISO/IEC 17788 and ISO/IEC 17789 respectively.
    The goal of this document is to ensure that all parties involved in cloud computing, particularly CSCs, CSPs and cloud service partners (CSNs) acting as cloud service developers, have a common understanding of interoperability and portability for their specific needs. This common understanding helps to achieve interoperability and portability in cloud computing by establishing common terminology and concepts.
