    ISO 3308:2012:
    - defines smoking parameters and specifies the standard conditions to be provided for the routine analytical machine smoking of cigarettes;
    - specifies the requirements for a routine analytical smoking machine complying with the standard conditions.
    Annex A specifies the ambient air velocities surrounding cigarettes in a routine analytical smoking machine, the mechanical design of the enclosures immediately surrounding them, and the methods of air velocity measurement including the location where air velocity is measured.
    Annex B describes, as an example, the special characteristics of a typical smoking machine incorporating a piston type of puffing mechanism.
    Annex C includes a diagram of a puff profile and illustrates definitions and standard conditions.
