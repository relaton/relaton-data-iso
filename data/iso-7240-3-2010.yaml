    ISO 7240-3:2010 specifies the requirements, test methods and performance criteria for audible alarm devices intended to signal an audible warning of fire between a detection and alarm system and the occupants of a building. It is intended to cover only those devices which derive their operating power by means of a physical electrical connection to an external source such as a fire alarm system.
    ISO 7240-3:2010 is also intended to cover audible alarm devices capable of giving voice messages by the application of specific requirements, tests and performance criteria. It specifies fire alarm audible alarm devices for two types of application environment, type A for indoor use and type B for outdoor use.
