    This part of ISO/IEC 14165 describes generic
    requirements for a communications transport
    medium called the Fabric, an entity that provides
    switched interconnect between pairs of
    user attachment points. Fabrics may be implemented
    using one or more topologies and this
    document describes requirements that are generic
    across all topologies.
    A companion document, ISO/IEC 14165-111,
    Fibre Channel - Physical and Signaling Interface
    (FC-PH), describes the physical interface,
    transmission protocol, and signaling protocol of
    high-performance serial links which attach user
    nodes to the Fabric. The Fabric serves to extend
    these serial links between pairs of attachment
    points. ISO/IEC 14165-111, FC-PH also
    describes features and behaviors of the Fabric
    required by user nodes.
