  content: "ISO 13856-2:2005 specifies the general principles and requirements for
    the design and testing of pressure-sensitive edges and pressure-sensitive bars
    for use as safety devices and not as actuating devices for normal operation. It
    is applicable to pressure-sensitive edges and pressure-sensitive bars, with or
    without an external reset facility, used to detect persons or parts of persons
    who may be exposed to danger such as hazardous moving parts. Its purpose relates
    primarily to safety and reliability rather than suitability. \nIt is restricted
    to the functioning of pressure-sensitive edges and pressure-sensitive bars and
    does not specify the requirements for their application, but does contain requirements
    for the information for use to be provided by the manufacturer. It does not specify
    the dimensions of the pressure-sensitive edges or bars in relation to a particular
    application. It is not applicable to stopping devices according to IEC 60204-1
    used only for normal operational, including emergency stopping, of machinery.
    Additional requirements could be necessary where pressure-sensitive edges and
    pressure-sensitive bars are used in locations accessible to elderly or disabled
    people or children."
