    1.1  This document provides general utilization requirements and recommendations and calculation methods adequate to guarantee the effectiveness and ultimate strength of tie-down/lashing arrangements performed to restrain cargo on board civil transport aircraft during flight, including the following:
    a) cargo loaded and tied down onto airworthiness approved air cargo pallets, themselves restrained into aircraft lower deck or main deck or upper deck cargo systems meeting the restraint requirements of air cargo pallets approved in accordance with ISO8097 (NAS 3610) or ISO 21100, or
    b) additional tie-down on aircraft structure when necessitated by pallet maximum gross mass or centre of gravity limits, or
    c) non-unitized individual pieces of cargo, or pieces of cargo placed onto an unrestrained pallet (floating pallet) into either lower deck, main deck or upper deck containerized cargo compartments of an aircraft,
    when using for this purpose restraint slings (wire rope cables) specified in ISO 20291-1.
    1.2  Restraint slings as specified in this document can also be used for permanent or semi-permanent attachment of a special purpose device, such as aircraft engine transport stand (see ISO 11241), horse stall (see ISO 9469), automobile transport device (see ISO 8268) or other, whether or not airworthiness approved, onto an aircraft pallet.
    1.3  This document applies to cargo tie-down/lashing arrangements using exclusively air cargo restraint slings conforming to ISO 20291-1.
    NOTE       Where tie-down is performed onto aircraft structure as per 1.1 b) or c), additional restrictions can be stated in the aircraft's authority approved Weight and Balance Manual.
    1.4  This document specifies industry recognized means of complying with airworthiness authorities general regulations applicable to load securing on board civil transport aircraft (see 14 CFR Part 25 and EASA CS-25, CCAR-25 or Japanese Airworthiness Standard Part 3), and aircraft manufacturers authority approved Weight and Balance Manuals for each aircraft type as specified therein.
    1.5  The wire rope slings in this document are intended exclusively for restraint purposes on board aircraft and are not intended to be used as lifting slings for handling or any other purpose.
