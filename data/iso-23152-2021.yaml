- content: |-
    This document specifies the methodology to conduct computational modelling of ultraviolet (UV) reactor designs for ballast water management systems (BWMS) that incorporate ultraviolet disinfection technology (UVBWMS). The computational modelling is used to calculate the UV reduction equivalent dose (RED) and to compare calculated REDs of the scaled reactor to its base reactor. REDs are determined using organisms with a given dose response.
    NOTE            The IMO requires validation of the computational model.
    The simulation of a physical UV reactor using a computational model requires that the model be validated (i.e. it performs as intended and reflects the correct physical constraints) and verified (i.e. produces outputs consistent with empirical data). A model developed according to this document is intended to validate the performance of simulated but untested, scaled UV reactors, where the simulation has been verified with test data from base model UV reactors within the product line. As a complete UV BWMS typically incorporates other treatment methodologies such as filters, the impact of changes to external subsystem performance on the overall BWMS is not considered in this document.
