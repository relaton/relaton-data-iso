    This International Standard specifies a method for the determination of ammonia and other volatile amines that can
    be liberated from photographic processing wastes by strong alkali, the results being expressed in terms of nitrogen.
    The method is applicable for the determination of the ammonia concentration of typical photoprocessing wastes in
    the range of 10 mg/l to 200 mg/l of ammonia or 8 mg/l to 160 mg/l of nitrogen. Other volatile amines are determined
    as ammonia, but their concentrations in photoprocessing wastes are usually very low.
