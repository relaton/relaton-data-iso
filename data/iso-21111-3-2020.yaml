- content: |-
    This document provides supplemental specifications to a physical layer capable of transmitting 1 Gbit/s over plastic optical fibre compliant with ISO/IEC/IEEE 8802-3:2017/Amd 9:2018, with specific application to communications inside road vehicles.
    Additionally, there is a test plan specified for conformance testing. The test plan includes test cases to assure compliance of an IUT with the functionality specified in this document.
    ISO/IEC/IEEE 8802-3:2017/Amd 9:2018 is considered indispensable for the application of this document.
    The supplemental specifications include wake-up and synchronised link sleep functionality. The specification includes the sublayers, service interfaces, and state diagrams that support the functionality. The supplemental specifications are collected in protocol implementation conformance statement (PICS).
    The requirements specified in ISO/IEC/IEEE 8802-3:2017/Amd 9:2018 and in this document constitute the complete PICS that specifies the GEPOF physical entity functionality.
    The optical component requirements and test methods for optical 1-Gbit/s transmission of in-vehicle Ethernet are not within the scope of this document.
