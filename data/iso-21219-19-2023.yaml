abstract:
- content: |-
    This document defines the TPEG Weather (WEA) application for reporting weather information for travellers. It provides general weather-related information to all travellers and is not limited to a specific mode of transportation.
    This application does not provide specific weather-related safety warnings to drivers; these are provided as safety related messages as part of the TPEG2-TEC application (ISO 21219-15).
    The WEA application provides weather-related forecasts and status information over multiple time periods and for multiple, possibly linked, geographical areas.
    NOTE            The presentation of the information is dependent on the specific human-machine interface (HMI) of the receiving device. Therefore, this document does not define any prerequisites for the HMI of the device.
    This document contains examples to help explain how some typical weather reports can be signalled (see Annex C) and suggested translations between WEA table codes and WMO SYNOP weather observation codes (see Annex D).
