abstract:
- content: This International Standard gives a procedure for the prediction by near
    infrared spectroscopy of constituents such as moisture, fat and protein and some
    minor parameters such as total glucosinolates in oilseeds and oilseeds meals.
    The determinations are based on spectrometric measurement in the near infrared
    spectral region.
