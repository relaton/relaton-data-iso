    IS/TR 17671-2 gives guidance for manual, semi-mechanized, mechanized and automatic arc welding of ferritic steels, excluding ferritic stainless steels, in all product forms. Details concerning the possible detrimental phenomena which can occur are given with advice on methods by which they can be avoided.
    This part of ISO/TR 17671 is generally applicable to all ferritic steels and is appropriate regardless of the type of fabrication involved, although the application standard can have additional requirements.
