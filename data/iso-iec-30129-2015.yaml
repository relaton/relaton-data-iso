  content: ISO/IEC 30129:2015(E) specifies requirements and recommendations for the
    design and installation of connections (bonds) between various electrically conductive
    elements in buildings and other structures, during their construction or refurbishment,
    in which information technology (IT) and, more generally, telecommunications equipment
    is intended to be installed in order to a) minimise the risk to the correct function
    of that equipment and interconnecting cabling from electrical hazards and b) provide
    the telecommunications installation with a reliable signal reference - which may
    improve immunity from electromagnetic interference (EMI).
