abstract:
- content: "This document defines the TPEG Speed information (SPI) application for
    reporting speed information for travellers. Speed limits are usually indicated
    to the driver through roadside signs. Drivers who are aware of the speed limit
    at all times are more likely to drive safely, which improves road safety. Most
    speed limit signs are static and remain unchanged for years and are thus available
    through navigation system map databases. However, there is an increasing number
    of variable message signs, temporary signing (e.g. for road works) and also changed
    speed limits which are not yet reflected in the map databases. \nWith the TPEG-SPI
    application, speed limit information is offered in an accurate way so that different
    lanes and different vehicle types can be differentiated. TPEG-SPI also allows
    the drivers to be aware of the current allowed (maximum) speed, by delivering
    timely information about the current position and values of speed limits to the
    navigation or driver assistance systems. These data are seen as informational
    and are intended to be encoded in a compact way to minimize bandwidth consumption.\nTPEG2-SPI
    supports direct and indirect speed limits. Direct speed limits are used for signs
    showing a maximum speed at which a vehicle is allowed to travel. Such speed limit
    signs can be static or dynamic. Indirect speed limits refer to the speed of other
    road users. It is primarily the vehicle in front of the own vehicle that is used
    as a reference."
