    This document specifies the sampling and analysis of phthalates in indoor air and describes the sampling and analysis of phthalates in house dust and in solvent wipe samples of surfaces by means of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS).
    Two alternative sampling, sample preparation and sample introduction methods, whose comparability has been proven in an interlaboratory test, are specified for indoor air[1]:
    —     sorbent tubes sampling with subsequent thermal desorption GC-MS, and
    —     sampling by adsorption and subsequent solvent extraction and injection to GC-MS.
    Additional adsorbents that can be used are described in Annex B.
    Depending on the sampling method, the compounds dimethyl phthalate to diisoundecylphthalate can be analysed in house dust as described in Annex D. The investigation of house dust samples is only appropriate as a screening method. This investigation only results in indicative values and is not acceptable for a final assessment of a potential need for action.
    Dimethyl phthalate to diisoundecylphthalate can be analysed in solvent wipe samples as described in Annex C. Solvent wipe samples are suitable for non-quantitative source identification.
    NOTE            In principle, the method is also suitable for the analysis of other phthalates, adipates and cyclohexane dicarboxylic acid esters, but this is confirmed by determination of the performance characteristics in each case.
    General information on phthalates are given in Annex A.
