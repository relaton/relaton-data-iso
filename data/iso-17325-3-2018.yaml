- content: |-
    This document specifies the requirements for the design of end connectors of oil booms used for the prevention of spreading of oil spills on water. These criteria are intended to define minimum mating characteristics and are not intended to be restricted to a specific configuration.
    It should be considered that different types of connectors are preferably used in different areas. This document does not define any priority. It remains the responsibility of manufacturers and users to select the right connector for the intended application.
    Stability features of boom connectors are the result of interaction between bodies of booms and connectors.
    This document does not purport to address all safety concerns, if any, associated with its use. However, it is the responsibility of the user of this document to establish the appropriate safety and health procedures, and to determine the applicability of regulatory limitations.
