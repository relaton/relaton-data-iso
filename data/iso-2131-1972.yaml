  content: The simplified system enables the characteristics of the substances to
    be expressed by an abbreviated lettering and numbering system, consisting of one
    letter and four figures (five in the case of compounds comprising several hydrphilic
    groups). The letter designates the ionic character and figures correspond to the
    functional groups present in the molecule.
