abstract:
- content: This document provides a testing method for testing phenol oxidative decomposition
    performance of semiconducting photocatalytic materials or made of a material adsorbed
    with photocatalyst to its surface for the purpose of purifying water polluting
    substances in water making use of photocatalytic performance as test piece. The
    test piece can be planar, spherical, flake or block shape. A test piece that can
    elute hydrocarbon or the like by immersion into water or phenol aqueous solution
    or by light irradiation, a semiconducting photocatalytic material that cannot
    maintain its shape or a powdery semiconducting photocatalytic material are excluded
    from the scope of application, since they cannot be evaluated.
