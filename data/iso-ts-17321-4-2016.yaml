    ISO/TS 17321-4:2016 specifies requirements for a programmable light emission system to produce various spectral radiance distributions intended for DSC colour characterization applications.
    NOTE 1       Evaluation metrics are described in this part of ISO 17321. These evaluations metrics are intended to provide "Figure of Merit (goodness)" relating to the ability of the device to produce arbitrary spectral power distributions.
    NOTE 2       This part of ISO 17321 applies to a programmable light emission system composed of LEDs. However, it can be applied to light emitting devices such as quantum dots, organic LEDs, laser diodes and so forth.
    NOTE 3       If spiky spectral reproduction is required, devices which have more spiky spectral light emission are intended to be used.
