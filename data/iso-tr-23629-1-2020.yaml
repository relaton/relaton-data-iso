    This document provides results of a survey on UTM which indicates aggregated data from survey respondents. It does not cover detailed analysis of regions and organizations.
    UTM is expected to reveal hundreds of commercial applications already in place, as well as social systems as their background conditions. The results can be used to analyze benefits and gaps for possible future standardization topics in consultation with authorities such as ICAO.
