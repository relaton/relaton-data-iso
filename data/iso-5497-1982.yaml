abstract:
- content: 'Application, in particular, to samples of intensely flavoured products
    and to samples of very concentrated products. The principle consists in making
    a preperation which allows direct assessment of the organoleptic properties of
    a sample according to the analysis required, as follows: a) for assessment of
    the properties of the sample itself: mixing the sample with a chemically defined
    substance or addition to a food medium considered to be neutral; b) for assesment
    of the effects of the sample in a food preperation: adding the sample to the food
    preparation for which it is intended.'
