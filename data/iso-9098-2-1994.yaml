  content: Specifies test methods to assess the safety of bunk beds for domestic use.
    Also applies to single beds for use at a height of the bed base of 800 mm or more
    above floor level, irrespective of the use to which the space below is put. The
    tests consist of the application, to various parts of the bunk bed, of loads or
    forces simulating normal functional use, as well as misuse that can reasonably
    be expected to occur. The test results are only valid for the article testet.
