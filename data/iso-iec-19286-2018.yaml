  script: Latn
  content: |-
    ISO/IEC 19286:2018 aims to normalize privacy-enhancing protocols and services by
    -     using the mechanisms from parts of ISO/IEC 7816 and parts of ISO/IEC 18328 that contribute to security and privacy,
    -     providing discoverability means of privacy-enabling attributes,
    -     defining requirements for attribute-based credential handling, and
    -     identifying data objects and commands for ICCs.
    Existing privacy-enhancing protocols available in a generic context are adopted for distributed systems including ICCs. Additionally, existing authentication protocols between an ICC and an external device used for establishing a secure channel are enhanced with privacy protection. Secure communication between an ICC and an on-card device is also considered.
    All the protocols and services described in this document contribute to privacy. Annex B describes an example of privacy impact assessments of respective systems.
