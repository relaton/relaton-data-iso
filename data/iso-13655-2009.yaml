- content: |-
    ISO 13655:2009 establishes procedures for the measurements and colorimetrical computations appropriate to objects that reflect, transmit, or self-illuminate, including flat-panel displays. It also establishes procedures for computation of colorimetric parameters for graphic arts images. Graphic arts includes, but is not limited to, the preparation of material for, and volume production by, production printing processes that include offset lithography, letterpress, flexography, gravure and screen printing.
    ISO 13655:2009 does not address spectral measurements appropriate to other specific application needs, such as those used during the production of materials, e.g. printing ink, printing paper and proofing media.
