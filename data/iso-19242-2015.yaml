    ISO 19242:2015 specifies a method for the determination of the total sulfur content of raw rubber and unvulcanized or vulcanized rubber compounds by ion chromatography following the preparation of a sample solution using either a tubular furnace combustion or an oxygen combustion flask method.
    The tubular furnace combustion method is applicable for rubbers with sulfur content less than 0,1 % as it is possible that the oxygen combustion flask method will not give sufficiently accurate results.
    The oxygen combustion flask method is not applicable to rubbers containing a metal salt that forms an insoluble metal sulfate, such as barium sulfate.
