    ISO 20433:2005 specifies a method for determining the amount of colour transferred from the surface of coloured leather to other surfaces by rubbing.
    Two tests are carried out, one with a dry rubbing cloth and one with a wet rubbing cloth.
    The method is applicable to all types of coloured leather. Since after-treatments of the leather as well as surface finishes can affect the degree of colour transfer, the test can be made before and/or after such treatment.
