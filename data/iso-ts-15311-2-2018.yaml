    This document gives guidance to print buyers and other users of print for assessing printed products on isotropic substrates that are typically held at a viewing distance of 30 to 50 cm. It specifies the proper application of required, recommended and optional metrics, measurement methods and, where appropriate, reporting requirements in the general commercial market.
    Although this document is expected to be used primarily to measure prints from digital printing systems the metrics are general and may be applied to other kinds of print.
    This document does not provide process control aims or tolerances as these differ widely for different types of commercial applications.
