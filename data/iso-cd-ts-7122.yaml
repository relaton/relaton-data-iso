  content: "This document identifies use cases related to the exchange of information
    between new small-sized point of care testing devices that enable real time PCR
    testing for diagnosis of infectious diseases, and clinical laboratories.\nThis
    document is applicable to use cases of small-sized real time PCR devices, including
    those that:\na) general test;\nb) lack of patient information;\nc) cancel and
    rerun test;\nd) on-site Quality Control (QC) process.\nThis document also provides
    guidelines on how to represent and exchange the result of real time PCR testing
    devices in a POCT environment applicable to the use cases described above. \nThis
    document is not intended to provide guidelines relating to traditional diagnostic
    testing results within a clinical laboratory."
