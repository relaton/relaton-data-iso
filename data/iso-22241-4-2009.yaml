    ISO 22241-4:2009 specifies the refilling interface for the NOx reduction agent AUS 32 in compliance with ISO 22241-1, which is needed to operate converters with a selective catalytic reduction (SCR) exhaust treatment system.
    ISO 22241-4:2009 specifies the minimum functional and geometric requirements of an open refilling system, in order to ensure compatibility between the on-board refilling system and the off-board refilling system.
    ISO 22241-4:2009 applies to commercial vehicles and buses as defined in ISO 3833 and having a gross vehicle mass of more than 3,5 t, designed to use stationary off-board refilling systems. ISO 22241-4:2009 also applies to the nozzle of stationary off-board refilling systems.
