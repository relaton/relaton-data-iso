  content: Suitable for use as a routine alternative to the Karl Fischer method specified
    in ISO 3699 but may give a lower standard of accuracy. Applicable to products
    having a water content between 0.01 % (m/m) and 0.4 % (m/m). Bases on the measurement
    of the conductance of anhydrous products using a dip cell electrode. Determination
    of the corresponding content by means of a calibration graph making a correction
    for the non-volatile acid content. Has also been approved by the IUPAC.
