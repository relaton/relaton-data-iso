abstract:
- content: ISO 24531:2013 assists ITS standards developers and users of ITS standards
    who wish to use XML, by providing a consistent definition of the rules and rule
    references for the use of XML within ITS systems. ISO 24531:2013 defines consistent
    rules and rule references to provide a framework to be used when implementing
    XML-based applications in ITS, and particularly in specifying XML in ITS standards,
    ITS data registries and ITS data dictionaries. ISO 24531:2013 also provides guidance
    and examples in respect of the use of XML in ITS, and the elaboration of XML within
    the ASN.1 data definitions required by ISO 14813-6 and ISO 14817.
