abstract:
- content: This document specifies a method for evaluating the change of consistency,
    as measured by cone penetration, of lubricating grease when worked in the roll
    stability test apparatus, in presence of water. The method only applies to greases
    with cone penetration in the range 175 1/10 mm to 385 1/10 mm as measured using
    ISO 2137.
