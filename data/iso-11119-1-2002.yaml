  content: "ISO 11119-1 specifies requirements for composite gas cylinders up to and
    including 450 litres water capacity, for the storage and conveyance of compressed
    or liquefied gases with test pressures up to and including 650 bar. The cylinders
    are constructed in the form of a seamless metallic liner over-wrapped with carbon
    fibre or aramid fibre or glass fibre (or a mixture thereof) in a resin matrix,
    or steel wire, to provide circumferential reinforcement. \nThis part of ISO 11119
    addresses cylinders with a design life from 10 a to non-limited life. For cylinders
    with a design life in excess of 15 a, and in order for these cylinders to remain
    in service beyond 15 a, re-qualification of these cylinders is recommended. \nThis
    part of ISO 11119 does not address the design, fitting and performance of removable
    protective sleeves. Where these are fitted they should be considered separately."
