abstract:
- content: Specifies procedures for determining the acidity , the residue on evaporation
    and the water content by the Karl Fischer method. The acidity test is applicable
    to products having acidities, expressed as hydrochloric acid, between 1 and 50
    mg/kg. For determination of ressidue on evaporation the method specified in ISO
    2210 is recommended which is applicable to products leaving a residue on evaporation
    equal to or greater than 5 mg/kg. The method for determination of water content
    is applicable to products having water contents between 5 and 200 mg/kg.
