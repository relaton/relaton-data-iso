  content: "The content of this document is divided into two parts.\n—     This document
    analyses the overall configuration of an industrial digital twin system, and proposes
    a three-elements architecture, focusing on the twinning interface between the
    physical twin (PTw) and industrial digital twin (iDTw).\n—     The characteristics,
    and the visualization elements and visualization fidelity of iDTw are analysed.\nThis
    document:\na)       analyses the twinning interface between the PTw and iDTw;\nb)      
    proposes a three-elements architecture;\nc)        analyses the visualization
    element and its fidelity, which is a key component of the interface among the
    three-elements architecture;\nd)       analyses the elements that constitute an
    iDTw system to understand the unique properties of iDTw;\ne)       explores the
    differentiation from cyber physical systems (CPS) or augmented reality (AR), which
    are similar to existing concepts of iDTw. \nThis document excludes:\n—     applications
    of iDTw;\n—     implementation of iDTw."
