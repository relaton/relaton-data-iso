abstract:
- content: Applicable to products having As contents of more than 0.1 mg/kg. Relates
    to the method of analysis according to ISO 2590. Reduction of the As by zinc in
    a hydrochloric acid solution with the formation of arsine. Absorption of the arsine
    in a solution of silver diethyldithiocarbamate in pyridine. Photometric measurement
    of the purplish-red colour produced by the colloidally dispersed silver at the
    maximum of the absorption curve at a wavelength of about 540 nm. Determination
    of the quantity of As by means of the calibration curve.
