    This International Standard specifies requirements for enclosures and other protective measures used to minimize mechanical hazards produced by the rotor in the unbalance measuring station of centrifugal (rotational) balancing machines. The hazards are associated with the operation of balancing machines under a variety of rotor and balancing conditions. This International Standard defines different classes of protection that enclosures and other protective measures provide and describes the limits of applicability for each class of protection.
    Devices for adjusting the mass distribution of a rotor and devices to transfer the rotor are not covered by this International Standard, even if they are combined with the measuring station.
    Special enclosure features, such as noise reduction, windage reduction or vacuum (which may be required to spin bladed rotors at balancing speed), are not covered by this International Standard.
