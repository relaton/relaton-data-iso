  content: The test represents very severe exposure to ultra-violet light and provides
    therefore a very rapid determination of light-fastness. Care must be taken in
    comparing the results of this test with the results of exposure to sunlight. The
    surface temperature generated by the light source can reach up to 90 °C, and this
    light source is not, therefore, suitable for testing of heat-sensitive anodic
    oxide coatings.
