  content: "This document provides a freight vehicle dynamic charging information
    collecting service function or application for non-enforcement applications and
    for regulated application services (RAS). It is intended for the road transport
    decarbonizing management purposes of regulated commercial freight vehicle movements
    using battery-powered heavy electric vehicles. This document also specifies the
    framework for remote energy consumption information collecting for non-enforcement
    and the conceptual operation of other management purpose applications.\nThis document
    is intended to reinforce vehicle energy efficiency for non-enforcement and other
    purposes by collecting dynamic charging information of battery powered heavy electric
    vehicles. Collected information can be used for fee collection and energy management
    purposes, which are outside the scope of this document. \nThis document is applicable
    to dynamic charging applications. It is not applicable to information exchange
    purposes such as charging right and payment authorization.\nStatic charging information
    exchange application is standardized by other ISO Technical Committees, such as
    ISO TC 22, Road vehicles, Subcommittee SC 31, Data communication. It is not applicable
    to this document. "
