abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 29341-18-4:2011(E) describes the device definition which is compliant
    with the UPnP Device Architecture version 1.0. It defines a device type referred
    to herein as RADiscoveryAgent device. The RADiscoveryAgent device is a UPnP device
    that provides the functionality capability for synchronizing the UPnP discovery
    information between two remote networks. The Remote Access Discovery Agent functionality
    is a combination of a RADASync service and a control point functionality that
    interacts with a remote RADASync service running on the remote network. Each control
    point is pushing discovery information about devices available in its local area
    network to its corresponding RADASync peer. This device provides control points
    with the following functionality:              \n- Ability to push discovery information
    from a remote network that will be used to recreate and propagate the original
    information into the local network.                                            \n-
    Ability to propagate multicast events from a remote network into the local network."
