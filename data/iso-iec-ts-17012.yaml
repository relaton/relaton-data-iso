abstract:
- content: "This document gives guidance in the use of remote methods for conducting
    audits of management systems.\n\nIt is applicable to all organizations that need
    to plan and conduct all kinds of internal or external audits (i.e. 1st, 2nd, 3rd
    party audits) of management systems.\n\nThis document is based on the general
    principles of auditing and gives guidance for specific conditions, possibilities
    and limitations for applying remote methods.\n\nThis document is intended to strengthen
    confidence in the use of remote methods for auditing management systems among
    customers, regulators, accreditation bodies, certification bodies, scheme owners,
    industry, employees, consumers and other interested parties. \n\nThe use of remote
    methods for management systems audits is not intended to completely replace regular
    onsite audit methods."
