    This document specifies requirements for the installation of exterior insulation and finish systems (EIFS) for wall applications using material which meet the materials requirements of ISO 17738‑1 and the design requirements of ISO 17738‑3. This document further includes installation requirements for the EIFS materials that include a water resistive barrier (WRB) and decorative projections as part of the cladding system for walls.
    This document does not include requirements for the structural design of the substrate/building structural members or for the integrity of the substrate/building structural members to which the EIFS is to be attached, nor the requirements for installation or repair of the substrate/building structural members before installation commences.
    This document does not include requirements for the competence that an EIFS installer needs for installation of the system.
    The installation of EIFS on horizontal surfaces exposed to direct precipitation is outside the scope of this document.
