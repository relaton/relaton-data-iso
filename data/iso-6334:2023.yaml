abstract:
- content: |-
    This document specifies the requirements for factory-made expanded perlite products which are used for thermal insulation of industrial installations and building equipment with an operating temperature from 23 °C to ~ 1 000 °C.
    The products are manufactured in the form of boards, pipe sections, segments, prefabricated ware and special ware.
    This document describes product characteristics and includes procedures for testing, evaluation of conformity, marking and labelling.
    Products covered by this document are also used in prefabricated thermal insulation systems and composite panels; the structural performance of systems incorporating these products is not covered.
    This document does not specify the required level or class of a given property required to be achieved by a product in order to demonstrate fitness for purpose in a particular application. The levels required for a given application can be found in regulations and invitations to tender.
    This document is not applicable to:
    a)       products with a declared thermal conductivity greater than 0 072 W/(m⋅K) at 70 °C;
    b)       products intended to be used for the insulation of the building structure;
    c)        the acoustical aspects
    1)       direct airborne sound insulation, and
    2)       impact noise transmission index.
