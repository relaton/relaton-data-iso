  content: "This document specifies the general aspects of impact resistant unplasticized
    poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC-HI) solid wall piping systems intended for water supply
    and for buried and above-ground drainage and sewerage under pressure. \n\nIn conjunction
    with ISO 1452-1, 1452-2 and 1452-3, it is applicable to PVC-HI pipes, fittings,
    valves and ancillary equipment, their joints and to joints with components of
    other plastics and non-plastics materials intended to be used for the following:
    \n\na) water mains and services lines buried in the ground, \nb) conveyance of
    water above ground for both outside and inside buildings; \nc) buried and above-ground
    drainage, sewerage and treated waste water under pressure. \n\nIt is applicable
    to piping systems intended for the supply of water up to and including 25 °C (cold
    water), intended for human consumption and for general purposes as well as for
    waste water under pressure. \n\nThis documents are also applicable to components
    for the conveyance of water and waste water up to and including 45 °C. \n\nThe
    piping system according to this International Standard is intended for the conveyance
    of cold water up to pressures of 2.5 MPa and especially in those applications
    where special performance requirements are needed, such as impact loads and pressure
    fluctuations, up to pressure of 2.5 MPa."
