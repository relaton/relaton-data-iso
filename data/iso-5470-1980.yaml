  content: Data obtained by this method may be used to predict the behaviour of these
    fabrics, but not as an absolute criterion. It is preferable to limit the significance
    of the test by considering it as a means of control only. The method only refers
    to the abrasion resistance of coating and is useful when comparing materials with
    the same or similar characteristics. The abrasion is measured by loss in mass.
    The figure shows a typical abrader.
