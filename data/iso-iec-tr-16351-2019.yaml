    This document provides guidance on the relationship between ISO/IEC 16350:2015 and a commonly used application management framework, ASL. It can be used by any organization or person wishing to understand how ASL can be used with ISO/IEC 16350:2015, including:
    a)   an internal or external application management organization that has demonstrated or intends to demonstrate conformity to the requirements specified in ISO/IEC 16350:2015 and is seeking guidance on the use of ASL to establish and improve an AMS and the processes;
    b)   an application management organization that already uses ASL and is seeking guidance on how ASL can be used to support efforts to demonstrate conformity to the requirements specified in ISO/IEC 16350:2015;
    c)   an assessor or auditor who wishes to understand the use of ASL as support to achieve the requirements specified in ISO/IEC 16350:2015.
    The correlations provided in this document relate to the 2nd version of ASL® (ASL2).
    Clause 4 describes how ASL® can support the demonstration of conformity to ISO/IEC 16350:2015.
    Clause 5 relates chapters in ASL® to clauses in ISO/IEC 16350:2015.
