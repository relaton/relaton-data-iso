  content: Applies to rotary piston engines and reciprocating internal combustion
    engines except of free piston engines for passenger cars and other motor vehicles,
    excluding motorcycles, mopeds and agricultural tractors, normally travelling on
    roads. Specifies a method of testing to evaluate their performance with a view,
    in particular, to presenting curves of power and specific fuel consumption at
    full load as a function of engine speed.
