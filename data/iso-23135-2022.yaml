- content: |-
    This document establishes a set of requirements for planning and executing verification programmes for commercial/non-commercial manned and unmanned space systems.
    This document defines a distributed verification programme for each contractor that engages in the development of any element of a space system, starting from the lowest level (i.e. unit/piece part level) and the earliest phase (i.e. requirement phase) to the acceptance and the delivery review of a system’s development as well as the launch site activities.
    This document primarily addresses verification associated with space, launch, and ground segment acquisitions. Space support segments including range safety, ground support equipment, and launch operation facilities, which are not otherwise addressed in this document, can also benefit from the described verification programme and management processes.
