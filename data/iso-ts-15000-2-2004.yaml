  content: ISO 15000-2:2004 addresses the requirements for an ebXML message service
    handler for the eBusiness community. ISO 15000-2:2004 defines a communications-protocol
    neutral method for exchanging electronic business messages and defines specific
    enveloping constructs supporting reliable, secure delivery of business information.
    ISO 15000-2:2004 includes a flexible enveloping technique permitting messages
    that is independent of the payload, the communications protocol used, and also
    of any format type. The versatility ensures legacy electronic business systems
    employing traditional syntaxes (i.e., UN/EDIFACT, ASCX12, or HL7) can leverage
    the ebXML infrastructure along with users of emerging technologies. Examples using
    these specifications with HTTP (RFC2616) and SMTP (RFC2821) are included.
