abstract:
- content: " \nThis International Standard specifies the minimum requirements for
    billing of all consumption-based utility\nnetwork services to domestic customers.
    It covers the processes required to produce the bill and to deal with\nissues
    that arise after the bill has been sent, as well as the content of the billing
    document or statement. This\nInternational Standard is applicable to utility network
    services that are unmetered, metered at the point of\ndelivery or metered remotely
    (e.g. on the supplier's own premises), and it covers any unmetered or unmeasured\ncharges
    appearing on the same bill as metered or measured charges, as well as flat rate
    charges.\nNOTE 1 Utility network services include electricity supply, water, sanitation,
    gas supply, district heating and\ncommunications.\nNOTE 2 The requirements given
    in this International Standard are also applicable to other consumers who are
    legally\nentitled to use the service provided by the supplier, except where in
    order to comply with privacy or data protection\nrequirements, it is necessary
    for the supplier to obtain the authority of the registered customer before dealing
    with another\nconsumer on billing matters.\nThis International Standard does not
    cover pricing, except for a requirement to provide information to\ncustomers.
    It is only applicable to billing for consumption-based utility network services
    and it applies to all bills\nor statements for utility network services where
    there is an ongoing account relationship between the customer\nand the supplier,
    regardless of the payment method used.\nNOTE 3 This includes bills for metered
    consumption, bills where a formula is used to estimate consumption (e.g. water\nbills
    based on the number of persons per household or the size of the house), or where
    a flat rate fee is charged regardless\nof consumption (e.g. telephony or internet
    bills where the tariff allows unlimited usage). It also applies to prepayment\ncustomers,
    where a bill or account from the supplier is necessary to enable the customer
    to reconcile the amount paid\nin advance with the cost of consumption, or where
    the customer expects to receive a bill based on point of sale or other\nadvertising
    (e.g. mobile telephony and energy metering) where codes, keys, electronic dongles
    or electronic cards are\nused to load and reload the service and to indicate what
    was purchased.\nNOTE 4 Services that are not billed [e.g. mobile telephony paid
    for by pre-purchased SIM (Subscriber Identity Module)\ncards that are unmetered]
    and services that are funded directly by the taxpayer without bills being issued
    are not covered\nby this International Standard.\nNOTE 5 Many of the key principles
    in this International Standard also apply to all forms of billing, and suppliers
    are\ntherefore encouraged to adopt the relevant requirements in this International
    Standard for billing of other services."
