  content: Presents and describes a means of identifying where new or revised manufacturing
    standards may be required. Establishes a reference model which is then used as
    the basis for developing a methodology for the identification and extraction of
    areas for standards. The field of interest is the manufacture of discrete parts
    and in particular the production of these parts. This model provides a conceptual
    framework for understanding manufacturing and can be used to identify areas of
    standards necessary to integrate manufacturing systems.
