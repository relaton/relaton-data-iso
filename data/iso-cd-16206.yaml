    This standard specifies the principle of phase quantitative analysis of residual α-quartz in silica bricks by X-ray diffraction, apparatus, reference materials, sample preparation, standard curve establishment, test procedures, results and calculations, and test report.
    This standard applies to the phase quantitative analysis of residual α-quartz in silica bricks, and the phase quantitative analysis of tridymite and cristobalite in silica bricks can also refer to this standard.
