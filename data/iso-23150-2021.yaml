    This document is applicable to road vehicles with automated driving functions. The document specifies the logical interface between in-vehicle environmental perception sensors (for example, radar, lidar, camera, ultrasonic) and the fusion unit which generates a surround model and interprets the scene around the vehicle based on the sensor data. The interface is described in a modular and semantic representation and provides information on object level (for example, potentially moving objects, road objects, static objects) as well as information on feature and detection levels based on sensor technology specific information. Further supportive information is available.
    This document does not provide electrical and mechanical interface specifications. Raw data interfaces are also excluded.
