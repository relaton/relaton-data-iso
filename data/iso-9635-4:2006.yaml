abstract:
- content: ISO 9635-4:2006 specifies construction and performance requirements and
    test methods for air valves, intended for operation in irrigation systems with
    water at temperatures not exceeding 60 °C, which can contain fertilizers and other
    chemicals of the types and concentrations used in agriculture. It is applicable
    to hydraulically operated air irrigation valves of DN 15 (1/2 inch) diameter or
    greater, designed to be directly operated, i.e. the force is applied to the obturator
    by the float, either directly or via a mechanical linkage. The valves can be operated
    by a force applied through an adjustable pilot valve.
