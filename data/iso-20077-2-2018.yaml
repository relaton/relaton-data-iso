abstract:
- content: |-
    ISO 20077-2:2018 specifies general rules and basic principles the manufacturer of the extended vehicle (ExVe) considers when elaborating its own design method. It does not specify the manner in which these design methods are drafted and implemented.
    ISO 20077-2:2018 specifies by means of a template the necessary information that is communicated to the ExVe manufacturer for requesting the design of a new ExVe functionality. It also specifies, by means of a template, the information the ExVe manufacturer provides for responding to that request. ISO 20077-2:2018 does not specify the process leading to the elaboration of the request information nor the process associated to communication of the response information.
    ISO 20077-2:2018 concerns the design of the extended vehicles mentioned in the scope of ISO 20077‑1, regardless of the type of communication interface which is used between the ExVe and external systems or parties. It does not concern the internal communication of the ExVe. It does not standardize the implementation of software or hardware nor preclude any technical solution the ExVe manufacturer might select when designing a new ExVe functionality.
    ISO 20077-2:2018 relates to the design and production phases of a vehicle, where these phases include the subsequent design upgrades by the ExVe manufacturer of vehicle models, variants, or types still in production.
    NOTE       Should new interfaces for remote communication with the vehicle become mandatory, then this document is also applicable for designing the requested ExVe functionalities.
