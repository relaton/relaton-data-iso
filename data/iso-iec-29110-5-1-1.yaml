  content: "This part of ISO/IEC 29110 is applicable to Very Small Entities (VSEs).
    VSEs are enterprises, organizations, departments or projects up to 25 people.
    The life cycle processes described in the set of International Standards (IS)
    Profiles and Technical Reports (TR) are not intended to preclude or discourage
    their use by organizations bigger than VSEs. \n\nThe scope of these projects is
    the conversion of documents published or approved as Technical Reports (TR) to
    International Standards (IS).\n\nThere will be no changes to the original and
    actual scope of the original project as documented in SC7N3288, which is an update
    version of the original NWIP ISO/IEC JTC1/SC7 N3288 New Work Item Proposal – Software
    Life Cycles for Very Small Enterprises - Dated 2005-06-21,  N3215, Resolution
    847.\n\nThe guidelines are informative, and contain no requirements (profile requirements
    corresponding to each guideline can be found in parts 29110-4-n).\n\nEach guideline
    will also be revised to accommodate changes in the profile base documents; to
    process a backlog of minor changes detected by the users and authors of the documents;
    and as a result of processing ballot comments."
