    This document specifies requirements for the design and tests of pneumatic driven quick-closing valves, used in ship fuel and lubricating oil systems to stop the fluid flow in the event of a leak. This document is applicable to valves of nominal diameter (DN): 15, 20, 25, 32, 40, 50, 65, 80, 100, 125, 150, 200, 250, and 300, corresponding to nominal pipe sizes (NPS): 1/2, 3/4, 1, 1 1/4, 1 1/2, 2, 2 1/2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, and 12.
    NOTE            This document is mainly intended for use by producers. Onboard ship inspection and maintenance after the delivery and installation of the valve can help ensure continued proper performance.
