  content: "ISO/IEC 26550:2013 provides a reference model consisting of an abstract
    representation of the key processes of software and systems product line engineering
    and management, and the relationships between the processes. \nIn the product
    line there are two development lifecycles (domain engineering and application
    engineering), the involvement of variabilities, and two process groups (organizational
    management and technical management). \nDomain Engineering lifecycle processes
    define and implement domain assets commonly used by member products within a product
    line, while Application Engineering lifecycle processes develop applications by
    exploiting the domain assets including common and variable assets. During domain
    engineering, product line variability, which reflects the specific needs of different
    markets and market segments, are explicitly defined. Variabilities are embedded
    in domain assets and during application engineering they are selected based on
    the defined variability models. \nOrganizational Management process group helps
    organizations to establish and improve capabilities for nurturing their product
    lines from conception to retirement and for establishing and managing relationships
    with customers, providers, and other key stakeholders. Meanwhile, Technical Management
    process group provides actual means used to support, monitor, and control the
    activities of both domain engineering and application engineering of a product
    line.\nThe reference model for software and systems product line engineering and
    management of ISO/IEC 26550:2013 can be used in subsequent standardization efforts
    to create appropriate standards for requirements engineering and management, design,
    realization, verification and validation, and organizational and technical management
    processes, tools, and methods of software and systems product line engineering."
