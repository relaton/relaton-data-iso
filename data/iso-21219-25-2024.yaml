    This document specifies the "electromobility information" (EMI) TPEG application. The EMI application has been specifically designed to support information about charging infrastructure for electric vehicles (not just cars), the location of e-charging points and their suitability for the respective vehicle (e.g. connector type, charging modality). As electric vehicles will occupy a “charging space” for longer a time than other vehicles, information on availability/waiting time and reservation options are accounted for, as they are highly relevant for enabling a user of an electric vehicle to optimally plan their route/trip.
    The standardized delivery, via TPEG technology, of electromobility information has the following benefits to an end user of this TPEG service:
    a)       identification of suitable charging units for vehicles, thus preventing unnecessary travel to find a fitting unit (also has environmental benefits);
    b)       verification of the real-time availability of charging units;
    c)        possibility of planning ahead and reserving a spot in a charging park, thus optimizing trip planning;
    d)       possibility of selecting a financially attractive charging point in a charging park where the operator has billing agreements with the user’s electromobility provider.
    In addition to these end-user benefits, electromobility providers and charging park operators also benefit from a standardized TPEG format as it facilitates harmonization of the electromobility information with the data formats used for the exchange of information between management systems of electromobility providers and charge park operators and related specifications (e.g. Open Charge Alliance,[1] eMobility ICT Interoperability Innovation (eMI3),[2] etc.).
    The EMI application, as an add-on service component next to traffic information, for example, is laid out to support large numbers of charge parks with only modest bandwidth requirements.
