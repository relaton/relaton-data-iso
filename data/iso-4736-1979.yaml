- content: Specifies a laboratory method of test. This test is designed to test for
    tightness, heat insulation and mechanical strength under standard conditions and
    for durability against treatment such as may occur during sweeping. This test
    provides information on the performance under a set of prescribed temperatur and
    flow rate conditions, but does not provide information appropriate to specific
    heating appliances.
