abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: ISO 19162:2015 defines the structure and content of a text string implementation
    of the abstract model for coordinate reference systems described in ISO 19111:2007
    and ISO 19111-2:2009. The string defines frequently needed types of coordinate
    reference systems and coordinate operations in a self-contained form that is easily
    readable by machines and by humans. The essence is its simplicity; as a consequence
    there are some constraints upon the more open content allowed in ISO 19111:2007.
    To retain simplicity in the well-known text (WKT) description of coordinate reference
    systems and coordinate operations, the scope of this International Standard excludes
    parameter grouping and pass-through coordinate operations. The text string provides
    a means for humans and machines to correctly and unambiguously interpret and utilise
    a coordinate reference system definition with look-ups or cross references only
    to define coordinate operation mathematics. Because it omits metadata about the
    source of the data and may omit metadata about the applicability of the information,
    the WKT string is not suitable for the storage of definitions of coordinate reference
    systems or coordinate operations.
