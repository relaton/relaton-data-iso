    The scope of ISO/TR 17427-6:2015 is to identify critical technical and financial risks that can impact the core system deployment supporting C-ITS vehicle and highway systems service provision and to provide means to evaluate such risks.
    ISO/TR 17427-6:2015 is designed to embrace C-ITS vehicle and highway systems where there is some institutional involvement and support, by the direct or indirect provision of core system support, and it is the risks associated with the deployment of ?Core Systems' that provide the focus of this Technical Report.
    ISO/TR 17427-6:2015 does not provide a calculated ?global' risk assessment for C-ITS, but identifies the principal causes of risk, and provides a consistent methodology for a jurisdiction, core system operator, or application service provider, to assess the risks that they face. The objective of this Technical Report is to raise awareness of and consideration of such issues and to give pointers, where appropriate, to standards deliverables existing that provide specifications for all or some of these aspects. This Technical Report does not provide specifications for solutions of these issues.
