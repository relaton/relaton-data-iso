abstract:
- content: |-
    ISO 15862:2009 provides basic requirements for the measurement of the spacecraft flight environments generated by the launch vehicle, telemetry data processing and formats of analysis reports.
    ISO 15862:2009 defines the field and number of measurement parameters, the principles of data processing, the format of delivered data and the content and the form of the flight environment analysis report.
    Flight telemetry data are used to verify if flight environment conditions exceed pre-flight analyses and environmental test results. In the event of a launch failure, adequate flight environment data can assist in investigating and analysing failure causes.
    ISO 15862:2009 is applicable to commercial launch vehicles and related ground processing, no matter which launch vehicle agencies are selected.
