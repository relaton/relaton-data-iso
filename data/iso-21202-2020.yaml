    This document contains the basic control strategy, minimum functionality requirements, basic driver interface elements, minimum requirements for reaction to failure, and performance test procedures for PALS.
    PALS perform part or all of lane change tasks under the driver's initiation and supervision. PALS are intended to function on roads with visible lane markings, where non-motorized vehicles and pedestrians are prohibited (e.g. access controlled highway), and to perform a lane change into a lane with traffic moving in the same direction. Support on sections of roadway with temporary or irregular lane markings (such as roadwork zones) is not within the scope of this document.
    This document does not describe functionalities based on combinations with longitudinal control systems such as those standardized in ISO 22839 (FVCMS) or ISO 15622 (ACC).
    The driver always assumes responsibility for this system and the driver's decisions and operations take priority at all times.
    Use of PALS is intended for light-duty and heavy-duty vehicles (heavy trucks and buses).
    This document does not address any functional or performance requirements for detection sensors, nor any communication links for co-operative solutions.
