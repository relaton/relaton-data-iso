    ISO 16399:2014 applies to water meters intended for irrigation use (herein after referred to as water meters), regardless of the water quality used for this purpose, and specifies the requirements and certification procedures for water meters, irrespective of the design technologies used to meter the actual volume of cold water or heated water flowing through a fully charged closed conduit. These water meters incorporate devices which indicate the integrated volume.
    ISO 16399:2014 also applies to water meters based on electrical or electronic principles and to water meters based on mechanical principles, incorporating electronic devices used to meter the actual volume flow of cold water. It provides metrological requirements for electronic ancillary devices when they are subject to metrological control. As a rule, the ancillary devices are optional. However national or international regulations make some ancillary devices mandatory in relation to the utilization of the water meter.
