  content: "This document specifies the means to organize and record architecture
    evaluations for enterprise, systems and software fields of application.\nThe aim
    of this document is to enable architecture evaluations that are used to:\na)    validate
    that architectures address the concerns of stakeholders;\nb)    assess the quality
    of architectures with respect to their intended purpose;\nc)    assess the value
    of architectures to their stakeholders;\nd)    determine whether architecture
    entities address their intended purpose;\ne)    provide knowledge and information
    about architecture entities;\nf)     assess progress towards achieving architecture
    objectives;\ng)    clarify understanding of problem space and of stakeholder needs
    and expectations;\nh)    identify risks and opportunities associated with architectures;
    and\ni)     support decision making where architectures are involved.\nNOTE       This
    document addresses the evaluation of an architecture and not an evaluation of
    the architecture description's suitability. Matters concerning the evaluation
    of the architecture description fall within the scope of the architecture conceptualization
    and architecture elaboration processes as defined in ISO/IEC/IEEE 42020. However,
    it is sometimes the case that the architecture description is evaluated concurrently
    with the evaluation of the architecture itself.\nThe entity being evaluated can
    be of several kinds, as illustrated in the following examples: enterprise, organization,
    solution, system, subsystem, business, data (as a data element or data structure),
    application, information technology (as a collection), mission, product, service,
    software item, hardware item, etc. The kind of entity can also be a product line,
    family of systems, system of systems, etc. It also spans the variety of applications
    that utilize digital technology such as mobile, cloud, big data, robotics, Internet
    of Things (IoT), web, desktop, embedded systems, and so on. \nThe generic Architecture
    Evaluation (AE) framework specified in this document can be used in support of
    the Architecture Evaluation process defined in ISO/IEC/IEEE 42020. Specific frameworks
    can be derived from this generic framework, which can provide a mapping to the
    system life cycle processes in ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 or to the software life cycle
    processes in ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207."
