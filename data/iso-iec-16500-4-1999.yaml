    This part of ISO/IEC 16500 provides a toolbox consisting of lower layer protocols and physical interfaces. Each
    tool is applicable at one or more of the reference points within the delivery system. The physical delivery media
    that have been identified for this version of ISO/IEC 16500-4 are copper pairs, coaxial cable, microwave, fiber
    and satellite. Removable information carrying physical media (e.g. optical discs and tapes) are not covered. The
    tools listed address the three parts of the delivery system, namely, the core network, the access network and the
    access-network-independent interface to the Set Top Unit (STU). Tools are also identified for the STU dataport
    interface and for a service provider system (SPS) internal network and an SPS/SPS core network.
    Clause 6 specifies in detail the tools provided to digitize the physical media in the core network. In the case of a
    broadband core network, all these tools support high speed ATM transport. Clause 7 specifies in detail the tools
    provided to digitize the physical media in the access network (copper pairs, coax, satellite, microwave, fiber). All
    these tools support high speed MPEG-2-TS transport and/or high speed ATM transport. Clause 8 concerns the
    access-network-independent interface to the STU and provides a detailed specification of the physical interfaces
    between the network interface unit (NIU) and the STU. This physical interface can be internal or external to the
    Set Top Box (STB) and is independent from the physical interface used in the access network. It supports the
    transport of MPEG-2-TS and ATM between NIU and STU. Clause 9 concerns the STU dataport interface and
    specifies the physical interfaces used to connect an STB to various peripheral devices. It defines normative STU
    multimedia dataport tools and interfaces and also includes informative specifications for both PC and parallel
    dataports. These interfaces support the transport of MPEG-2-TS or IP. Clause 10 defines the physical interfaces
    for interconnections between cascaded SPS entities with or without an intervening core network and the physical
    interfaces for networks used to connect various hosts within an SPS.
