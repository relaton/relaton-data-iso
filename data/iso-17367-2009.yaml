    ISO 17367:2009 defines the basic features of RFID for the use in the supply chain when applied to product tagging. In particular it
    - provides specific recommendations about the encoded identification of the product,
    - makes recommendations about additional information about the product on the RF tag,
    - makes recommendations about the semantics and data syntax to be used,
    - makes recommendations about the data protocol to be used to interface with business applications and the RFID system, and
    - makes recommendations about the air interface standards between the RF interrogator and RF tag.
    It only addresses product tagging and does not address product packaging.
