abstract:
- content: "ISO/PAS 3930:2009 specifies the metrological and technical requirements
    and tests for digital measuring instruments that serve to determine the volume
    fractions of certain components of the exhaust gases emanating from motor vehicles.
    The conditions with which such instruments shall comply in order to meet any OIML
    performance requirements are also established.\nISO/PAS 3930:2009 is applicable
    to instruments, particularly those used according to the procedure defined in
    ISO 3929, intended for the inspection and maintenance of in-use motor vehicles
    with spark ignition engines. These instruments are used to determine the volume
    fraction of one or more of the following exhaust gas components:\n- carbon monoxide
    (CO),\n- carbon dioxide (CO2),\n- hydrocarbons (HC, in terms of n-hexane), and\n-
    oxygen (O2)\nat the moisture level of the sample as analysed.\nIn addition to
    the measurement of these components, ISO/PAS 3930:2009 specifies the lambda calculation
    for the instruments provided with a facility to determine the value of air/fuel
    ratio in the exhaust gases.\nISO/PAS 3930:2009 applies to instruments whose principle
    of detection is based on infrared absorption in gases for CO, CO2 and HC. Oxygen
    is generally measured with a fuel cell. \nISO/PAS 3930:2009 does not exclude any
    other types of instruments that, although based on other principles of detection,
    meet the specified metrological and technical requirements and satisfy the associated
    tests. \nISO/PAS 3930:2009 defines three accuracy classes of the instruments:
    Class 00, Class 0 and Class I.\nISO/PAS 3930:2009 does not apply to equipment
    for on-board diagnostics incorporated in motor vehicles."
