  content: "This part of ISO 13099 describes methods of zeta-potential determination,
    both electric and acoustic, in heterogeneous systems, such as dispersions, emulsions,
    porous bodies with liquid dispersion medium. \nThere is no restriction on the
    value of zeta-potential or the mass fraction of the dispersed phase; both diluted
    and concentrated systems are included. Particle size and pore size is assumed
    to be on the micrometre scale or smaller, without restriction on particle shape
    or pore geometry. The characterization of zeta-potential on flat surfaces is discussed
    separately.\nThe liquid of the dispersion medium can be either aqueous or non-aqueous
    with any liquid conductivity, electric permittivity or chemical composition. The
    material of particles can be electrically conducting or non-conducting. Double
    layers can be either isolated or overlapped with any thickness or other properties.\nThis
    part of ISO 13099 is restricted to linear effects on electric field strength phenomena.
    Surface charge is assumed to be homogeneously spread along the interfaces. Effects
    associated with the soft surface layers containing space distributed surface charge
    are beyond the scope."
