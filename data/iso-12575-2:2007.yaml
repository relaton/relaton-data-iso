    ISO 12575-2:2007 specifies the responsibilities of the installers of exterior insulating systems for foundations such that a product that is manufactured and packaged in accordance with ISO 12575-1 is able to provide the properties declared by the manufacturer when installed according to ISO 12575-2:2007.
    ISO 12575-2:2007 stipulates responsibilities of the installer in the installation of the exterior insulation system, documentation of the installation and a declaration by the installer that all requirements of ISO 12575-2:2007 have been met.
    ISO 12575-2:2007 does not specify the fitness of the product for the intended use beyond those aspects relating to installation. Many aspects relating to the fitness for use are specified in ISO 12575-1.
    The installer can be required to meet additional requirements specified in local regulations or the customer's requirements.
