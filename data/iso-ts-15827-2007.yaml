abstract:
- content: "ISO/TS 15827:2007 describes test procedures for evaluating the effects
    of the interactions between driver frontal airbags or side airbags (excluding
    curtains) and small female arms.\nIt recommends dummies, procedures, instrumentation
    and test configurations that can be used for investigating the interactions that
    occur between a deploying airbag and a vehicle occupant. Driver frontal airbags
    deploy from the steering wheel and side airbags can deploy from the door, side
    trim panel, armrest, seat back or seat cushion. Occupants can range in size from
    young children to very large adults. However, the small adult female is considered
    to be the most at risk of arm injury from airbags. Therefore, this test procedure
    only addresses the small adult female occupant. \nRecommended measurements are
    summarized. ISO/TS 15827:2007 encourages the use of a wide range of test configurations
    and conditions, while recognizing that the range of possible airbag interactions
    is essentially limitless and beyond testing capability."
