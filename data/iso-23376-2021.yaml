- content: |-
    This document specifies performance requirements and test procedures for systems capable of warning the subject vehicle driver of a potential crossing-path collision with other vehicles at intersecting road segments.
    Vehicle-to-vehicle intersection collision warning systems (VVICW) rely on vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications and relative positioning between the subject vehicle and crossing-path vehicles (remote vehicles). V2V data, such as position, speed and heading are used to evaluate if an intersection collision is imminent between the subject and remote vehicles. The performance requirements laid out in this document specify the warning criteria for these systems.
    In addition, VVICW operate in specified subject and remote vehicle speed ranges, road intersection geometries and target vehicle types. Moreover, the requirements for the V2V data will be specified. The scope of this document includes operations on intersecting road segments (physically intersecting roads), and motor vehicles including cars, trucks, buses and motorcycles. Responsibility for the safe operation of the vehicle remains with the driver.
