    This International Standard specifies the OMG Interface Definition Language (IDL). IDL is a descriptive language used to define data types and interfaces in a way that is independent of the programming language or operating system/processor platform.
    The IDL specifies only the syntax used to define the data types and interfaces. It is normally used in connection with other standards that further define how these types/interfaces are utilized in specific contexts and platforms:
    ?   Separate "language mapping" standards define how the IDL-defined constructs map to specific programming languages, such as, C/C++, Java, C#, etc.
    ?   Separate "serialization" standards define how data objects and method invocations are serialized into a format suitable for network transmission.
    ?   Separate "middleware" standards, such as, DDS or CORBA leverage the IDL to define data-types, services, and interfaces.
    The description of IDL grammar uses a syntax notation that is similar to Extended Backus-Naur Format (EBNF).
