    This International Standard specifies a method of determining the presence of a lubricant on photographic film. It is
    intended that the test should be applied to film after processing, but the test may be used in other situations. It is
    applicable to both the emulsion and support sides of the film.
    The results of the test are calculated in terms of a coefficient of friction, but the test does not purport to characterize
    the frictional characteristics of the film material.
