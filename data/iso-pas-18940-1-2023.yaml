    This document specifies the test methods, the test conditions, the test target design, and the analysis procedures for the evaluation of the image permanence performance of digital photographic reflection prints. Tests based on ISO 18936, ISO 18937 (all parts), ISO 18941, and ISO 18946 characterize the thermal stability, the light stability, the ozone stability, and the humidity stability of photographic prints.
    This document is applicable to any digital photographic reflection print, which includes prints created by chromogenic silver halide, inkjet, electrophotography, thermal diffusion, and others. Black and white prints composed of metallic silver are not within the scope, but monochrome prints where the printing process contains dyes are within the scope.
    The document specifies the content and procedure for graphical reporting of test results as a first level data collection for basic technical communication of image permanence performance of photographic prints.
    Application-specific end-points, environmental conditions and test doses (durations, intensity) are not included in this document.
