- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: This document specifies the requirements for medical image-based modelling
    for 3D printing for medical applications. It concerns accurate 3D data modelling
    in the medical field using medical image data generated from computed tomography
    (CT) devices. It also specifies the principal considerations for the general procedures
    of medical image-based modelling. It excludes soft tissue modelling from magnetic
    resonance image (MRI).
