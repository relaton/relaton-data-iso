    ISO 17687:2007 supports the application of automated identification, monitoring and exchange of emergency response information regarding dangerous goods carried on board road transport vehicles. Such information may include the identification, quantity and current condition (such as pressure and temperature) of such goods, as well as any relevant emergency response information. When equipped with appropriate electronics and communications capabilities, vehicles carrying dangerous goods may respond to queries regarding their status or self-initiate a message.
    The information defined here, electronically carried on-board the road transport vehicle, may be transferred to interested roadside systems by whatever communications means are appropriate to that roadside system.
    The primary intent of ISO 17687:2007 is not trade, economic, or commercial, but to help save lives by facilitating emergency response. ISO 17687:2007 supports local on-site needs in the same manner as conventional visual placards do but with an optional, complementary, enhanced and more versatile electronic version.
