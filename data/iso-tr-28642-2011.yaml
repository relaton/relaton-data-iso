    ISO/TR 28642:2011 identifies three types of topics related to shade conformity and interconvertibility of monochromatic and polychromatic tissues and materials related to the discipline of dentistry; it describes visual and instrumental methods for assessment of these topics.
    ISO/TR 28642:2011 suggests interpretation of the findings through colour difference thresholds, and provides guidelines for future standardization related to dental shade conformity and interconvertibility. It also includes guidelines related to colour vision of persons undertaking visual colour assessment and instructions for reporting of colour and colour difference assessments.
