    This document specifies the minimum operational and performance requirements, methods of testing and test results of marine echo-sounding equipment required to comply with the performance standards adopted by the IMO Resolution A.224(VII) as amended by IMO Resolution MSC.74(69), Annex 4.
    This document is intended to be used in conjunction with IMO Resolution A.694(17) and with IEC 60945.
    For bridge alert management, IMO Resolution MSC.302(87) supersedes IMO Resolution MSC.74(69), Annex 4. Accordingly, this document incorporates references to IEC 62923-1 and IEC 62923-2 which are associated with Resolution MSC.302(87) for requirements and tests where applicable.
    In accordance with IMO Resolution MSC.74(69), Annex 4, Articles 1 and 2, the purpose of echo-sounding equipment is to provide reliable information on the depth of water under a ship to aid navigation in particular in shallow water. This document is applicable for ship speeds from 0 kn to 30 kn.
