  content: This document specifies requirements for ultrasonic attenuation spectroscopy
    methods for determining the size distributions of a particulate phase dispersed
    in a liquid at dilute concentrations, where the ultrasonic attenuation spectrum
    is a linear function of the particle volume fraction. In this regime particle-particle
    interactions are negligible. Colloids, dilute dispersions, and emulsions are within
    the scope of this document. The typical particle size for such analysis ranges
    from 10 nm to 3 mm, although particles outside this range have also been successfully
    measured. For solid particles in suspension, size measurements can be made at
    concentrations typically ranging from 0,1 % by volume up to 5 % by volume, depending
    on the density contrast between the solid and liquid phases, the particle size,
    and the frequency range[9],[10]. For emulsions, measurements can be made at much
    higher concentrations. These ultrasonic methods can be used to monitor dynamic
    changes in the size distribution.
