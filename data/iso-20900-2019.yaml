    This document addresses light vehicles[1], e.g. passenger cars, pick-up trucks, light vans and sport utility vehicles (motorcycles excluded), equipped with partially automated parking systems (PAPS).
    This document establishes minimum functionality requirements that the driver can expect and the manufacturer needs to take into account.
    Possible system configuration includes the following two types:
    —          Type 1: System supervised by the conventional driver located in the driver's seat;
    —          Type 2: System supervised by the remote driver (present within or outside the vehicle) that is not necessarily located in the driver's seat. The vehicle remains in the line of sight of the remote driver.
    For both types, minimum requirements and conditions of safety, system performance and function including HMI information content and description of system operating states are addressed.
    The requirements include the driver who supervises the safety throughout the system manoeuvres.
    System test requirements are also addressed including test criteria, method, and conditions.
