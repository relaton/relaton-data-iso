    This Technical Specification gives guidance on actuating forces for hand and foot controls on powered lawn,
    garden and horticulture equipment, and their displacement, preferred location and method of operation. It is
    applicable to operator controls on both ride-on machines and pedestrian-controlled machines. Handheld products
    are not covered.
    This Technical Specification is not applicable to passive controls (e.g. seat-activated, operator-presence controls
    utilized on ride-on machines). It contains data applicable to frequently used controls that require intentional
    operator actuation for control function. Infrequently used control forces and displacements may exceed the
    magnitudes given in this Technical Specification.
    NOTE The concept of frequently used controls is relative to a given machine type and its use or requirements.
