abstract:
- content: "This document provides guidance to manufacturers on the minimum requirements
    for the lifecycle management of in vitro diagnostic (IVD) medical devices that
    are developed in preparation for and in response to a public health emergency
    involving infectious agents requiring immediate availability of authorized IVD
    devices. \nNOTE            This document does not replace existing national (or
    regional) regulatory pathway requirements for IVD medical devices under non-emergency
    situations. The regulatory authorization process of emergency use-IVD medical
    devices is country-specific and it includes:\n—                   following a
    risk management process;\n—                   monitoring the device’s post-market
    performance and quality assurance;\n—                   implementing a communication
    system."
