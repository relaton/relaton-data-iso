- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "The measures in this standard were calculated from detecting and counting
    violations of good architectural and coding practices in the source code that
    could result in unacceptable operational risks or excessive costs. Establishing
    standards for these measures at the source code level is important because they
    have been used in outsourcing and system development contracts without having
    international standards to reference. For instance, the ISO/IEC 25000 series of
    standards that govern software product quality provide only a small set of measures
    at the source code level. \nA primary objective of updating these measures was
    to extend their applicability to embedded software, which is especially important
    for the growing implementation of embedded devices and the Internet of Things.
    Functionality that has traditionally been implemented in IT applications is now
    being moved to embedded chips. Since the weaknesses included in the measures specified
    in this document have been found to be applicable to all forms of software, embedded
    software is not treated separately in this specification."
