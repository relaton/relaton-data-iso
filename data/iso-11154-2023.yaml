    This document applies for roof racks of passenger cars and light commercial vehicles up to a permissible total weight of 3,5 t according to ISO 1176 and specifies requirements and test methods for these. It is also valid for roof racks mounted on trailers.
    So-called magnetic or suction foot racks, i.e. roof racks whose attachment on the vehicle is only via magnetic forces or vacuum, are excluded from this document.
    This document provides safety-related requirements under consideration of the weight, centre of gravity, air resistance and other safety-relevant properties for structures of roof racks for which no other technical or statutory regulations otherwise apply and which are not listed in 4.2. In individual cases, test requirements can extend beyond these requirements.
