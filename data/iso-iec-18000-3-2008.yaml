abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 18000 has been developed to provide a framework to define common
    communications protocols for Internationally useable frequencies for Radio Frequency
    Identification (RFID), and, where possible, to determine the use of the same protocols
    for all frequencies such that the problems of migrating from one to another are
    diminished; to minimize software and implementation costs; and to enable system
    management and control and information exchange to be common as far as is possible.
    \nISO/IEC 18000-3:2008 was prepared in accordance with the requirements determined
    in ISO/IEC 18000-1. ISO/IEC 18000-1 provides explanation of the concepts behind
    ISO/IEC 18000-3:2008.\nISO/IEC 18000-3:2008 has 2 MODES of operation, intended
    to address different applications. It summarizes the differences between MODE
    characteristics. The detailed technical differences between the modes are shown
    in the parameter tables.\nISO/IEC 18000-3:2008 relates solely to systems operating
    at 13,56 MHz.\nISO/IEC 18000-3:2008 provides physical layer, collision management
    system and protocol values for RFID systems for Item Identification operating
    at 13,56 MHz in accordance with the requirements of ISO/IEC 18000-1.\nISO/IEC
    18000-3:2008 provides definitions for systems for each MODE determined in ISO/IEC
    18000-3:2008.\nISO/IEC 18000-3:2008 defines two non-interfering MODES. \n- The
    MODES are not interoperable. \n- The MODES, whilst not interoperable, are non-interfering."
