abstract:
- content: The oil is not generally collected as a whole but in four successive fractions
    during the course of distillation. These four fractions. known respectively as
    "extra", "first", "second" and "third", are the oils usually found in the trade.
    Descriptions and permissible values for the characteristics appearance, colour,
    odour, relative density at 20/20 °C, refractive index at 20 °C, optical rotation
    at 20 °C, acid value, ester value are given in a table. Most characteristics differ
    in dependence from the country of origin (Madagascar or Comores).
