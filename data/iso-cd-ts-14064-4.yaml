  content: "This document describes the principles, concepts and methods relating
    to the quantification and reporting of direct and indirect greenhouse gas (GHG)
    emissions for an organization. It provides guidance for the application of ISO
    14064 1 to greenhouse gas inventory at the organization level, for the quantification
    and reporting of direct emissions and indirect emissions.\nThis document describes
    for all organizations, the steps for:\n\testablishing organizational boundaries,
    in accordance with either a control approach (financial or operational) or an
    equity share approach;\n\testablishing reporting boundaries, by identifying direct
    and indirect emissions to be quantified and reported; for each category of emission,
    guidance is provided on specific boundaries and methodologies for the quantification
    of GHG emissions and removals;\n\tGHG reporting: guidance is provided to promote
    transparency regarding the boundaries, the methodologies used for the quantification
    of direct and indirect GHG emissions and removals, and the uncertainty of the
    results.\nThe examples and case studies presented in this document are not exclusive
    and non-exhaustive. The values of the emission or removal factors mentioned in
    the examples are given for illustrative purposes only. A non-exhaustive list of
    database references is provided in Annex A (informative)"
