  content: ISO 5952:2005 applies to continuously hot-rolled steel sheet of structural
    quality having improved atmospheric corrosion resistance, also known as weather-resistant
    structural steel. The product is intended for applications where requirements
    are for mechanical properties and increased resistance to atmospheric corrosion.
    It is generally used in the delivered condition and is intended for bolted, riveted
    or welded structures.
