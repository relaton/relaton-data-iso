    ISO 18067:2015 specifies methods for the determination of dry-hot air shrinkage (after treatment) of synthetic filament yarns, skein method and single-end method. The skein method provides two forms of measurement which are of manual and automatic types. The single-end method gives the result by manual measurement.
    In case of dispute, manual measurement procedure is to be used.
    If these methods are not applicable, the corresponding test methods may be agreed between interested parties.
    ISO 18067:2015 is applicable to synthetic filament yarns of linear density less than 3 000 dtex.
    ISO 18067:2015 is not applicable to partially oriented yarns.
