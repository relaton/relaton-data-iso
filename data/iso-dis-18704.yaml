  content: "This document specifies requirements and provides recommendations for
    the pre-examination phase of cell free DNA (cfDNA) from body fluid specimens other
    than blood, including but not limited to the collection, handling, storage, transport,
    processing and documentation of human body fluids, such as urine, cerebrospinal
    fluid (CSF), pleural effusions and saliva, intended for cfDNA examination. Processing
    includes multiple steps, such as centrifugation for specimen cleaning and isolation
    of cfDNA. \n\nThis document is applicable to molecular in vitro diagnostic examinations
    performed by medical laboratories.\nIt is also intended to be used by health institutions
    including facilities collecting and handling specimen, laboratory customers, in
    vitro diagnostics developers and manufacturers, biobanks, institutions and commercial
    organizations performing biomedical research, and regulatory authorities.\n\nDedicated
    measures that need to be taken for cytohistological analysis of body fluid derived
    nucleated cells are not described in this document. Neither are measures for preserving
    and handling of pathogens, and other bacterial or whole microbiome DNA in body
    fluids described.\n\nDifferent dedicated measures need to be taken for preserving
    circulating cell free DNA (ccfDNA) from blood. These are not described in this
    document, but are covered in ISO 20186-3.\n\nNOTE\tInternational, national or
    regional regulations or requirements can also apply to specific topics covered
    in this document."
