  content: This control is intended essentially for the detection of alcoholic impurities
    in aceton. The principle consists in treatment of a test portion with Agulhon's
    reagent (potassium dichromate solution added to nitric acid solution) under specified
    conditions. The presence of certain impurities, in particular alcoholic ones,
    is indicated by a blue or violett coloration. International Standards ISO 757/1
    to ISO 757/5 cancel and replace ISO Recommendation R 757-1968, of which they constitute
    a technical revision. This document has also been approved by the International
    Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC).
