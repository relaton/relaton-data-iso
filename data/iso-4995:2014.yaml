    ISO 4995:2014 applies to hot-rolled steel sheet of structural quality in the grades listed in Table 1, usually prepared without the use of microalloying elements. The product is intended for structural purposes where particular mechanical properties are required. It is generally used in the delivered condition and is intended for bolted, riveted, or welded structures. This product is produced on a wide strip mill, not a plate mill.
    This International Standard does not cover steels intended for boilers or pressure vessels, steels designated as commercial quality or drawing quality (covered in ISO 3573[1]), steels to be re-rolled to cold-reduced products, or steels designated as weathering steels, having increased atmospheric corrosion resistance.
