abstract:
- content: "ISO/TS 18530:2014 outlines the standards needed to identify and label
    the Subject of Care (SoC) and the Individual Provider on objects such as wrist
    bands, identification tags or other objects, to enable automatic data capture
    using data carriers in the care delivery process.\nISO/TS 18530:2014 provides
    for a unique SoC identification that may be used for other purposes, such as recording
    the identity of the SoC in medical health records.\nISO/TS 18530:2014 serves as
    a reference for any organization which plans to implement or improve Automatic
    Identification and Data Capture (AIDC) in their delivery of care process. It is
    to be used in conjunction with the GS1[1] system of standards. \nISO/TS 18530:2014
    describes good practices to reduce/avoid variation and workarounds which challenge
    the efficiency of AIDC at the point of care and compromise patient safety.\nISO/TS
    18530:2014 specifies how to manage identifiers in the AIDC process, and completes
    the information found in ISO/TS 22220 and ISO/TS 27527.\n[1] GS1 is a registered
