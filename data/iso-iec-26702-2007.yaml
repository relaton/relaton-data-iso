abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 26702:2007 defines the interdisciplinary tasks which are required
    throughout a system's life cycle to transform customer needs, requirements and
    constraints into a system solution. In addition, it specifies the requirements
    for the systems engineering process and its application throughout the product
    life cycle. ISO/IEC 26702:2007 focuses on engineering activities necessary to
    guide product development, while ensuring that the product is properly designed
    to make it affordable to produce, own, operate, maintain and eventually dispose
    of without undue risk to health or the environment.
