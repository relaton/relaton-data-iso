  content: The ISO 22067 series specifies requirements and criteria for communication
    of environmental aspects within the print production supply chain. This document
    specifies requirements for environmental communication relating to print finishing,
    including binding, surface decoration and converting post press. This document
    is applicable for most post press processes but, due to their unique processing
    requirements, excludes post press processes for security printing and does not
    involve printing on textiles and ceramics.
