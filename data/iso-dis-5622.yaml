abstract:
- content: This document specifies a method for determination of carbon monoxide (CO)
    in the vapour phase of Heated Tobacco Products (HTP) using puffing regimes defined
    for this category of products. The part one will address the CO determination
    of electrically Heated Tobacco Product (eHTP).
