    ISO 11525-2:2015 gives specific requirements relating to the use of slewing variable-reach rough-terrain trucks (hereafter referred to as trucks), as defined in ISO 10896‑2.
    It is intended to achieve the following:
    a)   the prevention of personal injuries, property damage and accidents;
    b)   the establishment of criteria for inspection, maintenance, operation and training.
    For general user requirements for (non-slewing) variable-reach trucks, refer to ISO 11525‑1.
    For additional user requirements for variable-reach trucks handling freely suspended loads, refer to ISO 11525‑4.
    National or local requirements can apply, which could be more stringent.
