  content: "This document specifies requirements for the biobanking of human natural
    killer (NK) cells derived from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), including
    the requirements for the differentiaton, culture, characterization, quality control,
    storage, thawing and transport of NK cells. \n\nRequirements for the collection
    of biological source material, the transport to and reception of biological source
    material and hPSCs at the biobank, as well as the establishment, expansion and
    QC of hPSCs are covered in ISO 24603.\n\nThis document is applicable to all organizations
    performing biobanking of human NK cells used for research and development in the
    life sciences. \n\nThis document does not apply to human NK cells for the purpose
    of in vivo application in humans, clinical applications or therapeutic use.\n\nNOTE\tInternational,
    national or regional regulations or requirements or multiple of them can also
    apply to specific topics covered in this document."
