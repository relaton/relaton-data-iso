    ISO 17355:2002 specifies the requirements for a file delivery protocol and associated service for application in the space environment. It is intended for use over the current and envisaged packet delivery services used in the space environment.
    ISO 17355:2002 specifies a protocol and associated services that are applicable to space missions with continuous duplex contact, intermittent duplex contact, asymmetrical time-disjunct contact, and simplex contact and operates in the space-to-ground, ground-to-space, and space-to-space directions of transfer. It may be initiated by the file sending or receiving entity.
