    ISO 4998:2011 applies to continuous hot‑dip zinc‑ and zinc‑iron‑alloy‑coated carbon steel sheet of structural quality.
    The product is intended for applications where resistance to corrosion is of prime importance.
    The steel sheet is produced in a number of grades, coating mass, ordering conditions and surface treatments.
    ISO 4998:2011 does not cover steels designated as commercial quality, or drawing quality, which are covered in ISO 3575.
