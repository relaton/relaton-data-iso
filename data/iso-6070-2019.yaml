    This document establishes requirements to ensure appropriate exchange of information between manufacturers and users of auxiliary tables with a view to working out related specifications and possibly to comparing, in an objective way, the characteristics supplied by the manufacturers of auxiliary tables and associated guidance systems.
    This document is applicable to auxiliary tables which include slip tables and head expanders. It does not cover auxiliary tables with several degrees of freedom.
    This document provides three levels of description of the test equipment, as follows:
    a)   minimum level;
    b)   medium level;
    c)   high level.
    This document gives a list of characteristics to be specified for each level of description.
