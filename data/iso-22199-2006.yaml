  content: "ISO 22199:2006 specifies the emission limits and test conditions for lifts,
    escalators and passenger conveyors, which are permanently installed in buildings
    and for which ISO/TC 178 has direct responsibility for the production of International
    Standards, in relation to electromagnetic interference. These limits however,
    might not provide full protection against disturbances caused to radio and TV
    reception when such equipment is used within distances given in ISO 22199:2006.\nSince
    lifts travel large vertical distances in buildings, it becomes impracticable to
    test the installation either in a test laboratory or in situ (where the uncontrolled
    environment can also influence the test procedures and results). Likewise, due
    to practical restrictions imposed by the lift car internal dimensions, it is impracticable
    to test the lift car from within. Similar considerations regarding dimensions
    apply equally to the testing of escalators and passenger conveyors. Therefore,
    ISO 22199:2006 applies to the sub-systems and/or apparatus of lifts, escalators
    and passenger conveyors, an assembly of which will comprise an installation, the
    boundaries of which are indicated by example in Figures 2 and 3. However, ISO
    22199:2006 does not apply to lighting apparatus and also other services already
    proven to be in conformity with national EMC regulations "
