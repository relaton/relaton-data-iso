  content: Proposes methods and strategies to assess the thermal stress associated
    with exposure to cold environments. Cold stress is suggested to be evaluated in
    terms of both general cooling of the body and local cooling of particular parts
    of the body (e.g. extremities and face). The methods apply to continuous, intermittent
    and occasional exposure and in both indoor and outdoor work. Specific effects
    associated with certain meteorological phenomena (e.g. precipitation) are not
    covered and should be assessed by other methods.
