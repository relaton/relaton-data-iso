  content: This document provides requirements and recommendation for space-based
    systems that, using satellite radionavigation services, provide high accuracy
    positioning of rovers. It is particularly intended for rovers whose operation
    requires meeting specific safety requirements, including in situations of low
    visibility. This document also provides methods to verify the system requirements,
    as well as complementary information on particular applications (Annex A), mobile
    mapping systems (Annex B) and augmented positioning (Annexes C and D).
