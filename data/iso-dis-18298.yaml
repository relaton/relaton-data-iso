abstract:
- content: "This document specifies requirements for the design, construction and
    operation of platform barrier systems positioned at the edge of a station platform
    immediately adjacent to the rail or other guided vehicles in stations and boarding
    points for passenger services. This document includes:\n—\trequirements for the
    fixed structure and fixed parts along the platform;\n—\tphysical requirements
    for the movable doors and gates normally used by passengers;\n—\trequirements
    for emergency doors;\n—\trequirements for driver access doors;\n—\trequirements
    for platform extremity doors; and\n—\trequirements for the management of safety
    risks that are particular to barrier systems.\n\nThis document also gives requirements
    for the integration of barriers within the overall rail system, including:\n—\tsynchronisation
    of vehicle and platform barrier doors/gates;\n—\taudible and visible alerts;\n—\tintegrity
    of control systems;\n—\ttesting of the barrier installation;\n—\toperational performance;
    and\n—   requirements relating to other interfacing sub-systems, notably signalling
    and vehicles.\n\nFor barrier systems set back from the platform edge, which are
    used to control access to trains or for crowd management, relevant sections of
    the document can be used as guidance.\nThis document applies to all persons involved
    in the implementation and system integration of a platform barrier system, including
    infrastructure owners, designers, installers, and operators.\nThis document does
    not cover barrier systems using bars, ropes, etc. or which operate in a vertical
    direction.\nThis document applies to rail services, e.g. metro, tram systems and
    heavy rail services as requested by a project specification. It applies to small
    systems, working in conjunction with a single vehicle, or with larger systems
    working with a complete train.\nThis document applies to platform barrier systems
    used at sub-surface stations, enclosed surface stations (e.g. those enclosed for
    the purposes of providing an air-conditioned environment for waiting passengers),
    and those fully in the open-air.\nThis document does not cover normative requirements
    relating to fire performance or fire requirements arising from use of platform
    barrier systems as fire barriers."
