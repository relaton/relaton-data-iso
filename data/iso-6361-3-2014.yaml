  content: "ISO 6361-3:2014 specifies the tolerances on shape and dimensions for wrought
    aluminium and aluminium alloy strip by cold-rolling for general engineering applications.\nIt
    applies to products with thickness of over 0,15 mm up to, and including 16 mm.
    \nIt does not apply to semi-finished rolled products in coiled form to be subjected
    to further rolling (reroll stock), or to special products such as those that are
    corrugated or embossed.\nTechnical conditions for inspection and delivery of products
    covered by ISO 6361-3:2014 are specified in ISO 6361‑1."
