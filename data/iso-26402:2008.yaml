    ISO 26402:2008 specifies the dimensions and clearance zones at the interface between tractor and trailer for articulated steering devices of semi-mounted trailers used in agriculture. It also specifies the maximum permissible forces at the connection of such articulated steering devices.
    It is applicable exclusively in conjunction with ISO 24347, specifying a ball-type (mechanical) coupling device of 80 mm nominal diameter.
    It is not applicable to the verification of the mechanical strength of the interface of the articulated steering device's interface, nor to the mechanical coupling device; this International Standard does not include technical requirements for the articulated steering device itself.
