abstract:
- content: ISO 17901-1:2015 specifies the terms related to optical characteristics
    of holograms, the method to measure their diffraction efficiency, and the angular
    and wavelength selectivity measurement methods. These measurement methods are
    applicable to any type of hologram if the hologram yields a simple diffraction
    pattern, which means the reconstructed wave can be clearly separated from other
    diffracted and non-diffracted waves. In other words, holograms that yield complex
    diffraction patterns are excluded. There are no restrictions on the materials
    used to form the holograms.
