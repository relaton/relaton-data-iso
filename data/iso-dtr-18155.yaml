- content: |-
    The scope of this document is to provide generic principles of train detection, related operation management principles, and to show the link between them. It provides non-technical guidance for supporting the choice of a suitable train detection method relating to railway operation.
    It includes:
    - the generic principles of train detection.
    - a list of operational and environmental conditions affecting train detection.
    - a list of all train detection methods
    - possible selection criteria of each type of train detection.
    - the impact of each train detection method on operational requirements.
    - related operational management principles, for deficiencies and failures in each train detection method in operation.
    It excludes:
    - any technical requirements of specific train detection devices which are in the scope of IEC/TC9.
    - technical aspects of any future train detection technology covered in IEC/TC9.
