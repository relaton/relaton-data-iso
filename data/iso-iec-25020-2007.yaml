  content: "ISO/IEC 25020:2007 provides a measurement reference model and guide for
    measuring the quality characteristics defined in ISO/IEC 2501n, Quality Model
    Division. ISO/IEC 25020:2007 sets requirements for the selection and construction
    of quality measures. It also contains informative annexes addressing the following
    topics: criteria for selecting software quality measures and quality measure elements,
    demonstrating predictive validity and assessing measurement reliability, and an
    example format for documenting software quality measures.\nThe Quality Measurement
    Division, of which ISO/IEC 25020 is a member, also offers examples of quality
    measures that can be used across the product development life cycle. These measures
    are defined in the other documents in the division and correspond to the quality
    characteristics in a software product quality model such as that described in
    ISO/IEC 25010. ISO/IEC 25020:2007 and the quality measures are designed to be
    used, in particular, with other standards in the SQuaRE series that address quality
    requirements (ISO/IEC 25030) and product quality evaluation (ISO/IEC 25040). "
