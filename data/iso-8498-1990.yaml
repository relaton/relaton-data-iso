abstract:
- content: The purpose is to define woven-fabric defects, i.e. those characteristics
    that have been unintentionally introduced into the fabric. The presence of one
    or other of these characteristics in a fabric does not automatically imply that
    the fabric is sub-standard. Divided in general defects, yarn defects in a woven
    fabric, defects in the weft direction, defects in the warp direction, defects
    due to, or apparent after, dyeing, printing or finishing, defects of, or associated
    with, the selvedges.
