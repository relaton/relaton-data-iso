    This document specifies the "traffic event compact" (TEC) TPEG application. The TEC application has been specifically designed to support information about traffic events (e.g. road works, traffic jams). A specific form of traffic event is local hazard warnings which, being safety-related messages, are sent with high priority to warn a driver of unexpected dangerous situations (e.g. black-ice, accident beyond curves, obstacles on road, etc.).
    Generally, the TEC application is designed to allow receivers to:
    —     ensure travel safety for the driver;
    —     enable the calculation of alternative routes;
    —     avoid delays (e.g. traffic jams);
    —     warn the driver of obstructions on route; and
    —     provide the driver with information on infrastructural problems (e.g. closed petrol stations, non-functioning emergency telephones).
