    This document defines terms and specifies test methods for general performance requirements of voltage class B connectors with single-pole and multi-pole connections used with electrical wiring harnesses of road vehicles.
    This document applies to connectors for voltage class B electric circuits of electric propulsion systems and conductively connected auxiliary electric systems of electrically propelled road vehicles.
    This document applies to voltage class B connectors designed to be disconnected after mounting in the vehicle for repair and maintenance only. It does not apply to vehicle inlets of charging systems.
    This document applies to cable conductor sizes ranging from 1,5 mm2 to 120mm2.
    This document is not applicable to internal connections of electronic devices.
