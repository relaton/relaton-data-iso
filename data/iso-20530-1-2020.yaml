    This document defines the use cases and general requirements for supporting emergency services via P-ITS-S. Any automotive-related service providers can refer to this document for developing eCall service systems into eCall non-supportive vehicles.
    The P-ITS-S acts as a monitoring and data transmitting device which gathers a vehicle's speed, impact and airbag deployment signal to assess the accident occurrence and type of accident. Once gathered data has been determined as an accident, accident related information is sent to an emergency service centre.
    Only notable events, such as an airbag-deployed event, rollover and stationary accident, are concerned by this document. In addition, the vehicle data gathering device requirement and implementation methodology for the emergency service are not applicable to this document.
