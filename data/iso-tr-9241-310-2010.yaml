abstract:
- content: ISO/TR 9241-310:2010 provides a summary of existing knowledge on ergonomics
    requirements for pixel defects in electronic displays at the time of its publication.
    It also gives guidance on the specification of pixel defects, visibility thresholds
    and aesthetic requirements for pixel defects. It does not itself give requirements
    related to pixel defects, but it is envisaged that its information could be used
    in the revision of other parts in the ISO 9241 series.
