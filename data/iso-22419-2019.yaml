  content: This document specifies a test method to assess the performance of handrails
    using electrical resistance trace heating to provide anti-icing in low temperature
    environments, when installed for exterior applications. It includes requirements
    for the test facility, the test conditions, the test specimens, the test procedures
    and the test report.
