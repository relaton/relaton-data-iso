    This document summarizes current knowledge concerning a test method and its technical implementation, and existing knowledge about the bridging performance of biofuels.
    The document consists of three parts, as follows:
    —     Part I: Method for direct determination of bridging behaviour, to make it available for research and development purposes (see Clause 4).
    —     Part II: Implementing the measurement principle, to assist in the construction of test apparatus and to illustrate the performance of a bridging test (see Clause 5).
    —     Part III: Experience and results from bridging tests, to provide typical results on bridging for a wide range of biofuels already tested (see Clause 6).
