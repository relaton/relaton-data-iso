  content: Details the practical requirements for taking representative samples intended
    for chemical analysis and determination of the physical characteristics. Applicable
    to products during transport, loading/unloading, contimuous flow and storage.
    Will be revised when general methods are available. Taking samples is carried
    out without reduction of particle size by manual or mechanical removal of increments
    of constant mass. Storage of the increments and transport at ambient temperature
    in closed containers. Shall remain in the same physical and chemical state in
    which the sample has been drawn until the time of laboratory examination. Has
    also been approved by the IUPAC.
