    This document specifies requirements and provides guidelines for an organizational program for working carers providing care to:
    —    adult care recipients (e.g. adults with cognitive, sensory, physical, and invisible disabilities, adults with chronic or episodic conditions and older dependents);
    —    long-term childcare recipients (e.g. due to chronic illness or permanent cognitive, sensory or physical disability or injury).
    This document is applicable to any organization, regardless of size, sector or community setting (i.e. urban, rural or remote).
    This document can be used in conjunction with an organization’s management systems, human resource programs, and/or equity, diversity and inclusion programs, or on its own in the absence of a formal workplace program to support working carers.
