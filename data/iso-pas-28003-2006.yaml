abstract:
- content: "ISO/PAS 28003:2006 contains principles and requirements for bodies providing
    the audit and certification of supply chain security management systems according
    to management system specifications and standards such as ISO/PAS 28000. \nIt
    defines the minimum requirements of a certification body and its associated auditors
    recognizing the unique need for confidentiality when auditing and certifying/registering
    a client organization.\nRequirements for supply chain security management systems
    can originate from a number of sources, and ISO/PAS 28003:2006 has been developed
    to assist in the certification of supply chain security management systems that
    fulfill the requirements of ISO/PAS 28000, Specification for security supply chain
    security management systems for the supply chain. The contents of ISO/PAS 28003:2006
    may also be used to support certification of supply chain security management
    systems that are based on other sets of specified supply chain security management
    systems requirements. \nISO/PAS 28003:2006\n- provides harmonized guidance for
    the accreditation of certification bodies applying for ISO/PAS 28000 (or other
    sets of specified supply chain security management systems requirements) certification/registration;
    \n- defines the rules applicable for the audit and certification of a supply chain
    security management systems complying with the ISO/PAS 28000 requirements (or
    other sets of specified supply chain security management systems requirements);
    \n- provides customers with the necessary information and confidence about the
    way certification of their suppliers has been granted. "
