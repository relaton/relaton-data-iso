    This project describes the Syntax and Semantics (SynSem) module of the Lexical Markup Framework (LMF), a metamodel for representing data in monolingual and multilingual lexical databases used with computer applications. The SynSem module allows for the description of specific syntactic and semantic properties of lexemes, as well as the complex interactions between them. More specifically, the syntax part of the module describes the properties of a lexeme when combined with other lexemes in a sentence. When recorded in a lexicon, these properties make up the syntactic description of a Lexical Entry instance. The semantics part of the module, on the other hand, describes the sense of a lexeme and its relationship with other senses belonging to the same language. The SynSem interface describes the predicates, and the mapping between syntactic and semantic arguments.
    This serialization covers the classes of ISO 24613-1 (the LMF core model), ISO 24613-2 (the machine readable dictionary, MRD, model) and ISO 24613-4 (TEI serialization).
