abstract:
- content: Specifies the requirements for designing and the data required and the
    way in which they should be used in order to determine the earth motions to be
    taken as the design basis earthquake (DBE), moreover the way in which the proof
    of seismic design adequacy should be established and documented. Determination
    of DBE is covered by both probabilistic and deterministic methods. Is entirely
    applicable when the DBE is greater than or equal to intensity VII on the MSK scale.
    When the DBE is less, the structural analysis could also be performed by using
    simpler rules.
