- content: |-
    ISO/TS 12747:2011 gives guidance to follow, as a minimum, in order to assess the feasibility of extending the service life of a pipeline system, as defined in ISO 13623, beyond its specified design life. ISO/TS 12747:2011 applies to rigid metallic pipelines.
    Pump stations, compressor stations, pressure-reduction stations and depots are not specifically addressed in ISO/TS 12747:2011.
    ISO/TS 12747:2011 is not applicable to the following: flexible pipelines; pipelines constructed from other materials, such as glass reinforced plastics; umbilicals; topsides equipment; and structures and structural components.
    ISO/TS 12747:2011 is limited to life extension, which is an example of a change to the original design. Other changes, such as MAOP up-ratings, are excluded.
    The assessment methodology is applicable to other changes to the design at the discretion of the user.
