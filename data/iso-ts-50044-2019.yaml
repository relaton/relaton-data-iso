    This document gives guidelines for how to compare and prioritize energy saving projects (EnSPs) before implementation, using economic and financial evaluation. It includes a common set of principles.
    This document is applicable to all EnSPs and energy performance improvement actions (EPIAs) that are developed by stakeholders and organizations for improving energy performance, irrespective of the type and size of an organization and its energy use and consumption.
    The methodology for quantification methods for predicted energy savings and measurement and verification (M&V) of the energy savings are not in the scope of this document.
    NOTE The methodology for the estimation of the energy savings is critical when determining cost savings.
    The methodology of the scenario generation (building) for future energy saving measures and actions is not covered by this document.
    General rules and methodologies within this document can be used either independently or in conjunction with other standards and protocols.
