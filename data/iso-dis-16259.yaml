abstract:
- content: This document specifies test requirements and procedures for the performance
    test that shall be conducted in order to confirm the mechanical features of the
    LNG BOG re-liquefaction system on board a ship. This test procedure would be prepared
    to document the function and safety processes required by international standards
    and/or any administration for LNG BOG re-liquefaction system of LNG ships such
    as LNG FSRU(floating, storage, re-gasification unit), LNG carrier, LNG bunkering
    vessel, LNG fueled vessel. Functions that are specific to a manufacturer and any
    additional tests or specification required by client would not be included. This
    document provides a test procedure guideline for LNG ship’s BOG re-liquefaction
    system.
