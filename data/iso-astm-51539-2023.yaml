abstract:
- content: |-
    This document covers procedures for using radiationsensitive indicators (referred to hereafter as indicators) in radiation processing. These indicators may be labels, papers, inks or packaging materials which undergo a visual change when exposed to ionizing radiation (1-5).
    The purpose for using indicators is to determine visually whether or not a product has been irradiated, rather than to measure different dose levels.
    Indicators are not dosimeters and should not be used as a substitute for proper dosimetry. Information about dosimetry systems for radiation processing is provided in other ASTM and ISO/ASTM documents (see ISO/ASTM Guide 51261).
    This document does not purport to address all of the safety concerns, if any, associated with its use. It is the responsibility of the user of this document to establish appropriate safety, health, and environmental practices and determine the applicability of regulatory limitations prior to use.
    This document was developed in accordance with internationally recognized principles on standardization established in the Decision on Principles for the Development of International Standards, Guides and Recommendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.
