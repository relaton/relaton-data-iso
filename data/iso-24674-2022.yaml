  content: This document specifies a method and requirements for plasma nitriding
    and follow-up PVD hard coatings intended for use in cold-work moulds. This document
    provides the necessary information, such as the original structure of nitriding
    steels, process requirements, surface quality and adhesion of duplex PVD coatings,
    to create an optimal combination of high performance.
