abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: ISO/IEC 26515:2011 specifies the way in which user documentation can be
    developed in agile development projects. It is intended for use in all organizations
    that are using agile development, or are considering implementing their projects
    using these techniques. It applies to people or organizations producing suites
    of documentation, to those undertaking a single documentation project, and to
    documentation produced internally, as well as to documentation contracted to outside
    service organizations. ISO/IEC 26515:2011 addresses the relationship between the
    user documentation process and the life cycle documentation process in agile development.
    It describes how the information developer or project manager may plan and manage
    the user documentation development in an agile environment. It is intended neither
    to encourage nor to discourage the use of any particular agile development tools
    or methods.
