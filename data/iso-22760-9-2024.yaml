  content: "This document specifies definitions of and general requirements to a pressure
    relief device for limiting internal pressure of dimethyl (DME) fuel containers
    intended for use on the types of motor vehicles as defined in ISO 3833. It also
    provides general design principles and specifies requirements for instructions
    and marking.\nThis document is applicable to vehicles using gaseous fuels in accordance
    with ISO 16861. It is not applicable to the following:\na)       fuel containers
    for any application other than as noted above;\nb)       stationary, ship, railroad
    vehicle or aircraft DME engine installations;\nc)        fuel container mounting
    hardware; \nd)       electronic fuel management.\nNOTE 1        It is recognized
    that miscellaneous component properties not specifically addressed herein can
    be examined for compliance with the criteria of any applicable part of the ISO 20760
    series, including subjecting the component to appropriate functional tests.\nNOTE
    2        All pressures referred to in this document are gauge pressures unless
    otherwise specified."
