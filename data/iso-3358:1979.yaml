  content: The determination of orthophosphate is not possible if the content is lower
    than 0.1 % (m/m). Tetrametaphosphates and pentametaphosphates are not usually
    present in commercial products. Specifies the absorption of the phosphate anions
    on an anionic ion-exchange resin. Elution with potassium chloride solutions of
    increasing concentrations. Calculation of the P2 O5 content in the different eluate
    volumes by means of a conversion factor to the corresponding form. The annex gives
    a photometric method of analysis of eluates. The principle consists in formation
    of molybdatophosphate in a dilute sulphuric acid medium of eluate, reduction with
    ascorbic acid and photometric measurement of the reduced complex at a wavelength
    of about 650 nm. Typical ion-exchange columns are shown in figures. Cancels and
    replaces the first edition of ISO 3358/1976.
