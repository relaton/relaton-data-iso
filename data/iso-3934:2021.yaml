    This document specifies a system of classification of materials used in preformed gaskets for buildings. It applies to the following products:
    a) gaskets for use round the inside of door or window casings, i.e. weatherstripping (dynamic gaskets);
    b) gaskets for glazing (static gaskets);
    c) gaskets for use round infilling;
    d) gaskets for use between facade parts;
    e) gaskets for use between masonry walls.
    In addition to specifying the characteristics required for the constituent materials, some functional tests on the gaskets themselves are specified. The corresponding test procedures are given in Annexes A to E.
    This document applies to preformed gaskets made from vulcanized or thermoplastic rubber. It also applies to preformed gaskets made of cellular rubber designed for use at temperatures between −20 °C and +55 °C (thermal conditions category P1) and between −40 °C and +70 °C (thermal conditions category P3) (see Clause 4).
