    This International Standard specifies the following:
    _ dimensions of film lengths;
    _ latent-image frame numbering;
    _ latent-image digital bar-codes to identify the film DX number;
    _ dimensions of daylight-loading film magazines for use with 135-size cameras;
    _ a magazine bar-code that identifies the film's DX number as well as the number of exposures;
    _ camera auto-sensing areas, which provide an electrically readable encodement of film speed, number of
    exposures, and recommended exposure latitude for use with appropriately designed cameras;
    _ an information panel on which the film identification, speed and number of exposures are visible through a
    window in the back of appropriately designed cameras;
    _ film pull-out force specification;
    _ film-spool attachment strength specification.
    This International Standard is not intended to apply to "bulk" 35-mm film used for reloading into 135-size
    magazines, nor to the reloadable magazines themselves. Also, this standard does not apply to 135-size film and
    magazines that are used in single-use camera applications.
