abstract:
- content: "This document specifies a method for the enumeration of culturable microorganisms
    in water by counting the colonies on a low-nutrient agar culture medium after
    incubation at 22 °C for 7 d.\nThe method is intended to measure the operational
    efficiency of the treatment process of public drinking water supplies, including
    the water in distribution systems and containers. The method is particularly suitable
    to monitor water for human consumption which is low in nutrients and is distributed
    in temperatures below 20 °C. The method can be applied to all types of water,
    including pool and spa waters.\n\nNOTE 1\tThe low-nutrient agar in use in this
    document usually gives higher colony counts from water samples than nutrient-rich
    formulations of culture media typically used for enumeration of culturable microorganisms.
    \nNOTE 2\tThe method is also applicable for waters of very low nutrient content
    such as de-ionised, distilled or reverse osmosis waters.\n\nNOTE 3\tThis document
    describes the use of R2A medium. There are other formulations available, e.g.
    R3A medium that might be suitable for certain applications but go beyond the scope
    of this document."
