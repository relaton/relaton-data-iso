abstract:
- content: "This document addresses adaptation to climate change in the design of
    buildings and civil engineering works. \n\nThe document provides a framework,
    principles, and specific guidance for resilience design adaptive to climate change
    (RDACC) in buildings and civil engineering works. This type of design method will
    be applicable not only to new construction, but also to the renewal, retrofit,
    and replacement of buildings or civil engineering works.\n\nThis document does
    not address:\n— adaptation to climate change in the production and procurement
    of building materials, components and devices;\n— adaptation to climate change
    in construction processes;\n— climate change mitigation in buildings and civil
    engineering works;\n— emergency management in buildings and civil engineering
    works."
