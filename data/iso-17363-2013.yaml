- content: |-
    ISO 17363:2013 defines the usage of read/write radio-frequency identification technology (RFID) cargo shipment-specific tags associated with containerized freight for supply chain management purposes ("manifest tags"). ISO 17363:2013 defines the air interface communications, a common set of required data structures, and a commonly organized, through common syntax and semantics, set of optional data requirements.
    ISO 17363:2013:
    a) makes recommendations about a second generation supply chain tag intended to monitor the condition and security of the freight resident within a freight container;
    b) specifies the implementation of sensors for freight resident in a freight container;
    c) makes specific recommendations about mandatory non-reprogrammable information on the shipment tag;
    d) makes specific recommendations about optional, re-programmable information on the shipment tag;
    e) makes specific recommendations about the data link interface for GPS or GLS services;
    f) specifies the reuse and recyclability of the RF tag;
    g) specifies the means by which the data in a compliant RF tag is "backed-up" by bar codes and two-dimensional symbols, as well as human-readable information.
