  content: "ISO 28278-2:2010 gives guidelines for the assembly and bonding of glass
    elements in a frame, window, door or curtain-walling construction, or directly
    into the building by means of structural bonding of the glass element into or
    onto the framework or directly into the building. \nIt gives the assembler information
    that enables him to organize his work and comply with requirements regarding quality
    control.\nQuality control of the assembly process is of the highest importance.
    ISO 28278-2:2010 provides the minimum requirements for acceptable quality control
    of the process of structural sealant glazing (SSG) on a single project. The annexes
    contained at the end of ISO 28278-2:2010 provide the methods to ensure proper
    application and documentation for a safe and weatherproof glazing assembly product.\nThis
    process is intended to be applicable to most SSG projects. The project testing
    on metal substrates and glass products will determine proper surface preparation
    and installation instructions.\nThese rules do not apply to the adhesion or durability
    of the paint finishes or glass products. This is not intended to be a durability
    test requirement for the paint and glass products commonly used in the SSG process.\nThe
    structural, weatherproofing and sealant products which are commonly used in structural
    glazing applications are those based on organosiloxane, \"silicone\" polymers.\nISO
    28278-2:2010 does not preclude the use of other sealant types, where these can
    demonstrate suitability for service according to ISO 28278-2:2010 and when they
    are used following the recommendations of the sealant manufacturer."
