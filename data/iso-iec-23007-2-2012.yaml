  content: ISO/IEC 23007-2:2012 specifies advanced user interaction interfaces (AUI)
    to support various advanced user interaction devices. The AUI interface is a part
    of the bridge between scene descriptions and system resources. A scene description
    is a self-contained living entity composed of video, audio, 2D graphics objects,
    and animations. Through the AUI interfaces or other existing interfaces such as
    DOM events, a scene description accesses interesting system resources to interact
    with users. In general, a scene composition is conducted by a third party and
    remotely deployed.
