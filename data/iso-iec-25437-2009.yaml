  content: "ISO/IEC 25437:2009 specifies Web Services (in WSDL) and a SOAP binding
    for the Application Session Services defined in ISO/IEC 22534. The Application
    Session Services allow Applications to create and maintain a relationship with
    Servers termed Application Session. The Web services specified herein allow Service
    Requesters (Applications in ISO/IEC 22534) and Service Providers (Servers in ISO/IEC
    22534) to create and maintain such Application Sessions. \nIt builds upon and
    imports the XML schema definitions from ISO/IEC 22534. The method of making the
    WSDL description of the specified services available to Service Provider and Requester
    is out of the scope of ISO/IEC 25437:2009.\nThe ApplicationSessionTerminated operation
    of ISO/IEC 25437:2009 is an outbound asynchronous event notification that Service
    Requesters receive from the Service Provider. Service Requester may also receive
    the event notification from web services, e.g. ECMA-348, that use ISO/IEC 25437:2009
    for session management. \nISO/IEC 25437:2009 specifies the event subscription
    and notification behaviors supported by the two defined Options. Additionally
    it\n- specifies the event subscription mechanism using WS-Eventing,\n- specifies
    the event subscription mechanism using WS-BaseNotification,\n- specifies the asynchronous
    subscription response Option for the two event subscription mechanisms,\n- shows
    an example WS-Session WSDL binding with SOAP/HTTP,\n- lists SOAP XML Templates
    for ISO/IEC 22534 messages,\n- lists some SOAP XML Templates for WS-Eventing messages,\n-
    lists some SOAP XML Templates for WS-BaseNotification messages, and\n- provides
    a summary of changes from the previous edition (ISO/IEC 24537:2006)."
