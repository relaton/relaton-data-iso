abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 18033-2:2006 specifies encryption systems (ciphers) for the purpose
    of data confidentiality. The primary purpose of encryption (or encipherment) techniques
    is to protect the confidentiality of stored or transmitted data. An encryption
    algorithm is applied to data (often called plaintext or cleartext) to yield encrypted
    data (or ciphertext); this process is known as encryption. The encryption algorithm
    should be designed so that the ciphertext yields no information about the plaintext
    except, perhaps, its length. Associated with every encryption algorithm is a corresponding
    decryption algorithm, which transforms ciphertext back into its original plaintext.\nAn
    asymmetric, i.e. public-key, encryption scheme allows a sender to use a recipient's
    public key to transmit an encryption of a message to the receiver, who can use
    his secret key to decrypt the given ciphertext, thereby obtaining the original
    message. \nSuch a scheme should be secure in the sense that no information about
    the message should be leaked to a (resource-bounded) attacker, even if that attacker
    mounts a so-called 'chosen ciphertext' attack, in which he may obtain decryptions
    of other ciphertexts. This is the strongest type of attack that has been proposed
    for a public-key encryption scheme. \nISO/IEC 18033-2:2006 specifies the functional
    interface of such a scheme, and in addition specifies a number of particular schemes
    that appear to be secure against chosen ciphertext attack. The different schemes
    offer different trade-offs between security properties and efficiency."
