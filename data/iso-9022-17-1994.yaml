abstract:
- content: Specifies methods of testing of optical instruments and instruments containing
    optical components, under equivalent conditions, for their ability to resist combined
    contamination and solar radiation (here, contamination means the contact of optical
    instruments with corrosive chemical substances). The purpose of testing is to
    investigate the resistance of an instrument and, in particular, of instrument
    surfaces, coatings, or synthetic materials, to a short-time exposure to the contamination
    combined with solar radiation. The tests described are designed for the selection
    of materials and components for the instruments.
