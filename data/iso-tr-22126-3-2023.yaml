    This document examines semantic enrichment to support the maintenance of the ISO 20022 conceptual model. It reports on existing and proposed practices to enrich a model:
    —    in a repository, annotating repository concepts with metadata using semantic markup or constraints;
    —    outside a repository, using references to repository concepts, such as the provenance of changes.
