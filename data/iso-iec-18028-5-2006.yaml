  content: "ISO/IEC 18028-5:2006 provides detailed guidance on the security aspects
    of the management, operation and use of IT networks, and their inter-connections.\nISO/IEC
    18028-5:2006 defines techniques for securing inter-network connections that are
    established using virtual private networks (VPNs). It is relevant to all personnel
    who are involved in the detailed planning, design and implementation of VPN security
    (for example IT network managers, administrators, engineers, and IT network security
    officers).\nThe general objectives of ISO/IEC 18028 are to extend the security
    management guidelines provided in ISO/IEC TR 13335 and ISO/IEC 17799, by detailing
    the specific operations and mechanisms needed to implement network security controls
    in a wider range of network environments, providing a bridge between general IT
    security management issues and network security technical implementations. \nThe
    objective of ISO/IEC 18028-5:2006 is to provide support service to different organizations,
    IT network managers, administrators, technicians, and IT security officers in
    choosing the appropriate virtual private network solution. \nISO/IEC 18028-5:2006
    describes general principals of organization, structure, framework and usage of
    a virtual private IT networks (VPN). It discusses functional area, used standards
    and network protocols, the various different types of VPN, their respective requirements,
    characteristics, and other aspects."
