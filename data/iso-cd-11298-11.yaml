    This document, in conjunction with ISO 11298-1, specifies requirements and test methods for inserted hoses to be used for the renovation of underground water supply networks, which transport water intended for human consumption, including raw water intake pipelines.
    It applies to hoses and fittings, as manufactured, as well as to the installed lining system. It is applicable to flexible hoses, both loose-fit and close-fit, comprising a woven synthetic fibre core with thermoplastics membranes on both inside and outside, and to the associated fittings and joints for the construction of the lining system in each case.

    NOTE Loose-fit hoses are designed to independently resist sustained internal pressure without transfer of radial stress to the host pipe, while close-fit hoses are designed to come fully into contact with the host pipe and resist the internal pressure in combination with it.

    It is applicable to hoses, connectors, fittings and assemblies intended to be used at an operating temperature of 20°C as reference temperature, or up to a maximum of 40°C with suitable derating.
