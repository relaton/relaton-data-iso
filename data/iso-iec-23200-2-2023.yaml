abstract:
- content: |-
    This document specifies a test method to evaluate the interference rejection performance of UHF RFID interrogators covered by ISO/IEC 18000-63, and specifies the general requirements and test requirements of that test method.
    NOTE            The interference rejection test method of this document is different to the one in ISO/IEC 18046-3:2020, 8.5. This document covers interference effects between the tags and a heterogeneous (diverse content) wireless system. ISO/IEC 18046-3 covers interference effect between tags and homogeneous (same content) wireless systems.
    This test method enables the comparison of the relative interference rejection performance among UHF RFID interrogators under a single wireless interference environment. In addition, this document can be used in a benchmarking test, according to requirements in a given application or service.
