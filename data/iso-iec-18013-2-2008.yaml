abstract:
- content: |+
    ISO/IEC 18013-2:2008 establishes guidelines for the content and formatting of data stored on an ISO compliant driving licence (IDL) using machine-readable technologies. It creates a common basis for the international use of IDL data without restricting individual domestic or regional driver licensing authorities from applying their specific data policies.
    ISO/IEC 18013-2:2008 specifies the following items.
    - Mandatory and optional machine-readable data. Machine-readable IDL data support the following functions (subject in some cases to the inclusion of appropriate optional data elements):

    confirming the driving privileges of a driver;
    enabling a link to be established to a driving privilege database;
    age verification;
    identity verification;
    biographical data verification;
    evidence of residence;
    biometric authentication;
    document authentication and validation.


    - The logical data structure.
    - Encoding methods for the following:

    cases where the memory capacity available to the IDL application does not exceed 5 kB, typically applicable to 2D barcode symbologies, high-coercivity high-density magnetic stripe and limited memory capacity integrated circuits (contactless and those with contacts);
    integrated circuits (contactless and those with contacts) where the memory capacity available to the IDL application exceeds 5 kB;
    optical memory.
