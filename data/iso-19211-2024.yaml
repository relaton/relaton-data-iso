abstract:
- content: "This document specifies requirements for fire activated oxygen shut-off
    devices that stop the flow of oxygen in respiratory therapy tubing when activated
    by fire.\nNOTE 1        Typical arrangements for fire activated oxygen shut-off
    devices are shown in Annex C.\nNOTE 2        Respiratory therapy tubing is covered
    by ISO 17256.\nNOTE 3        Use of fire activated oxygen shut-off devices in
    medical devices or accessories is not mandated in this document.\nThe fire activated
    oxygen shut-off devices specified in this document are not suitable for use with
    oxygen therapy systems with flows in excess of 20 l/min).\nNOTE 4        There
    is rationale for this clause in A.2.\nThe requirements in this device-specific
    standard take precedence over any conflicting requirements in the general standard
    for airway devices (ISO 18190). All the common requirements that appear in the
    general standard for airway devices have been removed from this document. "
