  content: The method comsists in preparing of a test solution by adding water to
    test portion, in the case of products containing more than 10 mg of free sulphur
    dioxide per litre, adding of acetaldhyde, then adding of p-toluidine and barbituric
    acid solution to an aliquot potion of the test solution, thus forming a red coloration
    by reaction with 5-hydroxymethylfurfural present, and spectrometric measuring
    at a wavelenght of 550nm.
