abstract:
- content: Standards are developed by many bodies at national and international levels,
    which in general prepare their documents by consensus processes. Alongside the
    growth of international trade and technological cooperation, standardizing bodies
    have developed procedures and modes of cooperation which are commonly considered
    to constitute good practices for standard development at all levels. These practices
    are set out in the form of a code, applicable to governmental and non-governmental
    consensus bodies. The guide deals with procedures for the development of standards,
    advancement of international trade, participation in the standards development
    process, coordination and information.
