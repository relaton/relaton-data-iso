  content: "Users of bar code systems have experienced problems with poor read rates.
    These read rate problems can sometimes be attributed to spectral gloss from either
    the substrate or the image or both. \nIn many bar code applications, the position
    and orientation of the scanner relative to the bar code symbol can be directly
    controlled by the operator. In these applications, the presentation of the bar
    code symbol to the reader will usually be manipulated by the operator to achieve
    optimal performance. However, in bar code applications using fixed position automated
    reading systems, the ability to control bar code symbol presentation to the reader
    and achieve optimised performance is diminished. \nDue to the very high volume
    of bar code marked items in today's supply chain, even a small reduction in read
    rate can represent significant logistics problems.\nTraditional gloss measurements
    are made at the angle that maximises specular reflection and do not provide results
    that can be used to predict performance at other angles. Moreover, many laser
    scanners use a retro-collective optical system that would correspond to a gloss
    meter using a zero degree angle of incidence, which is not commonly available.
    \nPresent international bar code quality standards, such as ISO/IEC 15416, do
    not factor the impact of gloss from either the bar code image or substrate into
    quality grade ratings. Thus a Grade '4' label may be high gloss or low gloss.
    Low gloss labels and images tend to work well in all scanning systems, while high
    gloss labels and images may not. In the absence of industry specifications, users
    have no convenient reference to use when requesting suppliers to provide labels
    that will work well in their systems. ISO/IEC TR 19782:2006 provides a method
    for the measurement of gloss that will permit users to judge if the bar code symbol
    and substrate are suitably matched for the reading system used in their application.\nLow
    opacity of the substrate can degrade system performance because it may reduce
    the apparent contrast of the bar code symbol. ISO/IEC TR 19782:2006 therefore
    provides means for measuring the substrate opacity. \nThe test method described
    in ISO/IEC TR 19782:2006 provides a means for the production of reproducible measurements.
    In specific applications, it may be necessary to correlate these measurements
    to practical performance. For example, a substrate backed by dark liquid may exhibit
    lower opacity than when measured dry.\nISO/IEC TR 19782:2006 gives guidelines
    to deal with the effects of substrate gloss and/or low opacity on the performance
    of bar code symbols when scanned by reading and verification systems. \nIt defines
    methods of measurement for gloss and opacity; it identifies conditions and values
    that present a risk of reading problems and provides recommendations to users
    on the specification of substrates and the set-up of scanning systems to minimize
    these problems. It also addresses the relationship between verification results
    and read performance when either or both of the factors are present. \nISO/IEC
    TR 19782:2006 is intended for those who specify or implement labelling systems
    and those involved in the reading of bar code symbols on packages, components
    and other carriers of bar code symbols."
