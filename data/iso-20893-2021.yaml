    This document defines detailed space debris mitigation requirements and recommendations for the design and operation of launch vehicle orbital stages in Earth orbit.
    The requirements defined in this document are applicable for:
    —     avoiding the release of space debris;
    —     disposing of a launch vehicle orbital stage after the end of its mission so as to avoid a break-up in orbit;
    —     disposing of a launch vehicle orbital stage after the end of its mission so as to minimize interference with the protected regions;
    —     safely re-entering a launch vehicle orbital stage.
