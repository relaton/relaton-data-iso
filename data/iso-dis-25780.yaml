abstract:
- content: "ISO 25780:2011 specifies the properties of the piping system and its components
    made from glass-reinforced thermosetting plastics (GRP) based on unsaturated polyester
    resin (UP) for water supply, irrigation, drainage or sewerage systems with or
    without pressure. \nISO 25780:2011 is applicable to GRP-UP piping systems, with
    flexible joints, intended to be installed using jacking techniques. It specifies
    the characteristics of pipes made from GRP-UP, with or without aggregates or fillers
    and also specifies the test parameters for the test methods referred to in ISO
    25780:2011.\nISO 25780:2011 is applicable to pipes and joints with a size range
    from DN100 to DN4000 which are intended to be used for the conveyance of water
    or sewage at temperatures up to 50ºC, with or without pressure.\nISO 25780:2011
    covers requirements to improve the design of the joint and specifies type test
    performance requirements for the joints as a function of the declared nominal
    pressure rating of the pipeline system and the required joint deflection capability
    of the system."
