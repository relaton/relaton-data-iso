  content: "ISO 13859:2014 specifies the quantitative determination of 16 PAH in sludge,
    soil, and treated biowaste using GC-MS and HPLC-UV-DAD/FLD covering a wide range
    of PAH contamination levels. When using fluorescence detection, acenaphthylene
    cannot be measured.\nThe limit of detection depends on the determinants, the equipment
    used, the quality of chemicals used for the extraction of the sample, and the
    clean-up of the extract. Typically, a lower limit of application of 0,01 mg/kg
    (expressed as dry matter) can be ensured for each individual PAH. \nSludge, soil,
    and treated biowaste can differ in properties and also in the expected contamination
    levels of PAH and presence of interfering substances. These differences make it
    impossible to describe one general procedure. ISO 13859:2014 contains decision
    tables based on the properties of the sample and the extraction and clean-up procedure
    to be used. Two general lines are followed, an agitation procedure (shaking) or
    use of Soxhlet/pressurized liquid extraction."
