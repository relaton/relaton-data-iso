    ISO/ASTM 51939 outlines irradiator installation qualification and dosimetric procedures to be followed in the irradiation of blood and blood products by the blood-banking community. If followed, these procedures will help to ensure that the products processed with ionizing radiation from gamma, bremsstrahlung X-rays or electron sources receive absorbed doses within a predetermined range.
    ISO/ASTM 51939 covers dosimetry for the irradiation of blood for the following types of irradiators: self-contained dry-storage 137Cs or 60Co irradiators (free-standing irradiators), tele-therapy units, self-contained bremsstrahlung X-ray units and electron accelerators. The absorbed dose range for blood irradiation is typically 15 Gy to 50 Gy.
    This International Standard also covers the use of radiation-sensitive indicators for the visual and qualitative indication that the product has been irradiated. It is intended for use by technically and non-technically oriented people and, therefore, contains more tutorial information than many other ISO/ASTM dosimetry standards.
