  content: "ISO 9815:2010 specifies a lateral stability test for passenger-car and
    trailer combinations. It is applicable to passenger cars in accordance with ISO
    3833, and also to light trucks, and their trailer combinations. \nThe lateral
    stability test determines the damping characteristic of the yaw oscillation of
    such towing-vehicle–trailer combinations excited by a defined steering impulse.
    The combination is initially driven in a steady-state, straight-ahead driving
    condition. Oscillation of the vehicle is then initiated by the application of
    a single impulse of steering, followed by a period in which steering is held fixed
    and the oscillation of the combination is allowed to damp out. Testing is conducted
    at several constant speeds. Where non-periodic instability is of interest, a steady-state
    circular test is specified."
