abstract:
- content: "ISO 7240-13:2005 specifies the requirements for compatibility and connectability
    assessment of system components that either comply with the requirements of ISO
    7240 or with a manufacturer's specification where there is no ISO 7240 International
    Standard. ISO 7240-13:2005 includes only system requirements when these are necessary
    for compatibility assessment.\nISO 7240-13:2005 also specifies requirements for
    the integrity of the fire detection and fire alarm system when connected to other
    systems. \nISO 7240-13:2005 is applicable to systems where the components are
    connected to control-and-indicating equipment (c.i.e.) and where the components
    are interconnected by electrical wires. For fire detection and fire alarm systems
    using other means of interconnection (for example optical fibre or radio frequency
    links), ISO 7240-13:2005 may be used as guidance.\nISO 7240-13:2005 does not specify
    the manner in which the system is designed, installed and used in any particular
    application."
