    This International Standard provides recommendations concerning the storage conditions, storage facilities,
    enclosures, and inspection for recorded polyester-base magnetic tapes in roll form. It covers analog and digital
    tape and includes tape made for audio, video, instrumentation and computer use.
    This International Standard is applicable to medium-term and extended-term storage of magnetic tape as defined in
    3.18 and 3.7 and also is applicable to magnetic-tape records intended as master tapes, which should not be in
    frequent use.
    Deviations from these recommendations, whether before or after recording, may result in shortened life
    expectancy. For example, adverse conditions during shipment, handling, or usage.
    This International Standard is not applicable to "work" or "use" copies (see informative annex C).
