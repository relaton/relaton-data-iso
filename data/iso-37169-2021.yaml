    This document specifies a procedure for run-through train operations, identified as smart transportation. This concept provides direct, one-seat ride services in high quality corridors connecting cities and transportation hubs without forcing transfers. Improved operations planning, greater use of interchange or rental use arrangements are described so that these services can be implemented without constructing major infrastructure improvements in existing transportation corridors and right-of-way.
    This document also describes the application of run-through operation in bus services that are strictly licensed to bus carriers using public roads, ending the inconvenience of forcing passenger transfers between routes or service territories.
    NOTE       Smart transportation by run-through operation is applicable to other transportation modes besides rail and bus services, if applied in services operated in the same mode. Refer to ISO 37154 for applicable transportation modes.
