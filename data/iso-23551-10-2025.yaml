abstract:
- content: "This document specifies safety, constructional, performance and testing
    requirements of normally open automatic vent valves, hereafter referred to as
    “valves”.\nThis document applies to valves with a declared maximum operating pressure
    up to and including 500 kPa of nominal connection sizes up to and including DN 100
    (4”), for use in gas control train of gas burners or in appliances using gaseous
    fuels such as natural, manufactured or liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). It is not
    applicable to corrosive and waste gases.\nThis document applies to:\n—     electrically
    operated valves and to valves actuated by fluids where the control valves for
    these fluids are actuated electrically, but not to any external devices for switching
    the control signal or actuating energy; \n—     valves fitted with open position
    indicator switches.\nThis document covers type testing only."
