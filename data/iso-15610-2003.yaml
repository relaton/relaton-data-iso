abstract:
- content: |-
    ISO 15610:2003 gives the necessary information to explain the requirements referenced in ISO 15607 concerning the qualification of welding procedures based on tested consumables. In addition, it gives the range of qualification.
    ISO 15610:2003 applies to arc and gas welding but other fusion welding processes may be accepted if specified.
    It is limited to application to parent metals that produce acceptable micro structures and properties in the heat affected zone and which do not deteriorate significantly in service.
    This International Standard is not applicable where requirements for hardness or impact properties, preheating, controlled heat input, interpass temperature and post-weld heat-treatment are specified for the welded joint.
    The use of ISO 15610.2003 may also be restricted by an application standard or a specification.
