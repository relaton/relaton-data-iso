  content: It applies in principle to all types of board having bursting strengths
    between 350 and 5,500 kPa, and is also applicable to papers and boards having
    bursting strengths as low as 250 kPa if the paper or board is to be used to prepare
    a material of higher bursting strength, such as corrugated board. For this test
    the paper is submitted to increasing hydraulic pressure.
