    ISO 9125:2009 specifies technical requirements and methods for the inspection and testing of fibre-cement slates and shingles and their fibre-cement fittings, designed to protect the weather-exposed surfaces on roofs and claddings of buildings.
    Products covered by ISO 9125:2009 can be used for other purposes provided they comply with the appropriate national or international application code or standard.
    ISO 9125:2009 applies to fibre-cement slates with a height dimension not exceeding 850 mm for overlapping assembly.
    The type tests described in ISO 9125:2009 are not intended to evaluate the performance of the coating in isolation (colour fastness, adhesion, etc.). Specific performance requirements for coatings are referenced in other ISO or national standards.
    ISO 9125:2009 does not apply to fibre-cement slates reinforced with asbestos fibres.
    ISO 9125:2009 does not include calculations for installation requirements, wind uplift or rain proofing of the installed products.
    National standards for installation requirements can be adopted.
