abstract:
- content: |-
    This document specifies a basic framework with principles, characteristics and approaches for the realization and enhancement for automated artificial intelligence (AI) systems’ controllability.
    The following areas are covered:
    —     state observability and state transition;
    —     control transfer process and cost;
    —     reaction to uncertainty during control transfer;
    —     verification and validation approaches.
    This document is applicable to all types of organizations (e.g. commercial enterprises, government agencies, not-for-profit organizations) developing and using AI systems during their whole life cycle.
