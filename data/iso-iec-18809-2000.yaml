    This International Standard specifies the physical and magnetic characteristics of an 8 mm wide magnetic tape cartridge
    containing a memory chip to enable physical interchange of such cartridges between drives. It also specifies the quality of the
    recorded signals, the recording method and the recorded format - called Advanced Intelligent Tape No. 1 with Memory In
    Cartridge (AIT-1 with MIC) - thereby allowing data interchange between drives by means of such magnetic tape cartridges.
    The System Log is recorded in the MIC.
    This International Standard specifies two types of cartridge depending on the thickness of the magnetic tape contained in the
    case.
    Information interchange between systems also requires, at a minimum, agreement between the interchange parties upon the
    interchange code(s) and the specifications of the structure and labelling of the information on the interchanged cartridge.
