abstract:
- content: ISO 14612:2004 specifies technical requirements for the enhanced functionality
    of ship's bridge layout and design, with the key navigational functions centralized
    and integrated, for the purpose of securing safe and efficient operation of the
    ship, berth-to-berth, regardless of the watchkeeping arrangement in place at the
    time. These requirements are generally additional to those given in ISO 8468.
    Where there are physical limitations in applying this International Standard,
    i.e. to small ships or ships of unusual design, the general principles still apply
    and can be implemented as far as practicable. It is applicable to seagoing ships
    where bridge duty is regularly maintained.
