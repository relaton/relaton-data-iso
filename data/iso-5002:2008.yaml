abstract:
- content: ISO 5002:2008 specifies the characteristics of carbon steel sheet of commercial
    and drawing qualities in cut length or coil form, zinc coated by electrolytic
    deposition. Electrolytic zinc-coated sheet is intended for the manufacture of
    formed or of miscellaneous parts, and can be supplied chemically treated to render
    it more suitable for painting. The zinc coating is expressed in micrometres of
    thickness per side, for either equally coated, differentially coated or one-side-coated
    sheets. These sheets are generally produced with coatings which are not intended
    to withstand outdoor exposure without chemical treatment and painting. Electrolytic
    zinc-coated sheet can be produced in thicknesses of 0,36 mm and thicker (normally
    up to 4,0 mm) and in widths of 600 mm and over in coils or cut lengths. It is
    recognized that materials thinner than 0,36 mm or thicker than 4,0 mm can be suitable
    for electrolytic zinc coating, and, if required, be the subject of agreement between
    the interested parties.
