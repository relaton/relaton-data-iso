  content: Belongs to a series of standards concerned with the major subject. The
    three annexes do not form integral parts of ISO 8191-2. The test methods are intended
    for a combination of materials used such as covers and fillings in uphlostered
    seating, and not for a particular finished item of furniture incorporating these
    materials. They only give an indication of, but cannot guarantee, the ignition
    behaviour of the finished item of furniture.
