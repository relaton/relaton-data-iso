    ISO/TR 14742:2010 provides a list of recommended cryptographic algorithms for use within applicable financial services standards prepared by ISO/TC 68. It also provides strategic guidance on key lengths and associated parameters and usage dates.
    The focus is on algorithms rather than protocols, and protocols are in general not included in ISO/TR 14742:2010.
    ISO/TR 14742:2010 deals primarily with recommendations regarding algorithms and key lengths.
    The categories of algorithms covered in ISO/TR 14742:2010 are:
    - block ciphers;
    - stream ciphers;
    - hash functions;
    - message authentication codes (MACs);
    - asymmetric algorithms;

    digital signature schemes giving message recovery,
    digital signatures with appendix,
    asymmetric ciphers;


    - authentication mechanisms;
    - key establishment and agreement mechanisms;
    - key transport mechanisms.
    ISO/TR 14742:2010 does not define any cryptographic algorithms; however, the standards to which ISO/TR 14742:2010 refers may contain necessary implementation information as well as more detailed guidance regarding choice of security parameters, security analysis, and other implementation considerations.
