abstract:
- content: |-
    ISO 11999 specifies minimum design and performance requirements for personal protective equipment (PPE) to be used by firefighters, primarily but not solely to protect against exposure to flame and high thermal loads.
    To assist with choice based on user risk assessment, types and performance levels for different categories of protection are included.
    The scope of ISO 11999-1:2015 does not include PPE for use in high-risk fire exposures where, for example, protective clothing with reflective surface according to ISO 15538 might be more appropriate, or for use in long-term firefighting operations in high ambient temperature (for example, bush, wildland, or forest firefighting) where equipment according to ISO 16073 might be more appropriate.
    Similarly, ISO 11999 does not include PPE to protect against chemical and biological hazards, other than against short-term and accidental exposure while engaged in firefighting and associated activities when fighting fires occurring in structures.
    ISO 11999-1:2015 describes the general structure of this International Standard, sets design and performance requirements for PPE, and includes requirements for marking and manufacturer's instructions.
