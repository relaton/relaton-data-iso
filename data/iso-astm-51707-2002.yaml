abstract:
- content: |-
    ISO/ASTM 51707 defines possible sources of error in dosimetry performed in gamma, X-ray (bremsstrahlung) and electron irradiation facilities and offers procedures for estimating the resulting magnitude of the uncertainties in the measurement results. Basic concepts of measurement, estimate of the measured value of a quantity, 'true' value, error and uncertainty are defined and discussed. Components of uncertainty are discussed and methods are given for evaluating and estimating their values. How these contribute to the standard uncertainty in the reported values of absorbed doses are considered and methods are given for calculating the combined standard uncertainty and an estimate of overall (expanded) uncertainty. The methodology for evaluating components of uncertainty follows ISO procedures. The traditional concepts of precision and bias are not used. Examples are given in five annexes.
    This International Standard assumes a working knowledge of statistics and several statistical texts are included in the references.
