    ISO 11613:2017 specifies test methods and minimum performance requirements for protective clothing used by firefighters who are engaged in support activities of firefighting. This clothing is not intended for interior attack firefighting. These support activities of firefighting are defined (see 3.8.2) as activities such as:
    -      water and material supply;
    -      extinguishing fires from the outside of the structure;
    -      prevention of exterior spreading to adjacencies, preventing enviromental damage and limiting effect of smoke;
    -      securing traffic and environment;
    -      first aid base activities;
    -      preparing the fire ground for subsequent activities;
    -      RPD replenishment tasks;
    -      assessment zone;
    -      BA communication;
    -      forward command post;
    -      evacuation;
    -      assist planning;
    -      assist logistics;
    -      assist communication;
    -      transportation.
    ISO 11613:2017 covers the general clothing design, the minimum performance levels of the materials used, and the methods of test for determining these performance levels.
    ISO 11613:2017 is not equivalent to ISO 11999-3, clothing worn by firefighters who are at risk of exposure to high levels of heat and/or flame while fighting fires occurring in structures. This document provides lower minimum level of protection.
    Selection of the appropriate system of clothing is dependent on carrying out an effective risk assessment which identifies the hazards to be faced, evaluates the likelihood of those hazards, and provides the means to reduce or eliminate these hazards. Details of one example of a recommended risk assessment approach and some factors for consideration are included in Annex A
    ISO 11613:2017 does not cover special clothing for use in other high risk situations such as specialized firefighting, or clothing for use in long term firefighting operations in high ambient temperature, for example bush, wildland, or forest firefighting where clothing according to ISO 15384 could be more appropriate. It does not cover clothing for use in high-risk fire exposures, for example reflective protective clothing according to ISO 15538 could be more appropriate.
    ISO 11613:2017 does not cover protection for the head, hands and feet or protection against other hazards, for example chemical, biological, radiation and electrical hazards. These aspects can be dealt with in other standards.
    NOTE       Additional "fit for purpose" personal protective equipment to protect the head, hands, respiratory system and feet should be worn with clothing specified in this document and in majority of situations appropriate protection is also required to be worn. Firefighters need to be trained in the use and care of protective clothing covered by this document including an understanding of its limitations and of the other items of personal protective equipment that can be required depending on the risks encountered
