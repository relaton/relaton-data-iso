  content: "This document specifies the procedure for the photographic activity and
    dye coupler reactivity tests.\n\nThis document is applicable to general photographic
    enclosure materials such as paper, tissue, cardboard, mat board and plastics.
    It is also applicable to components of photographic enclosure materials such as
    adhesives and marking substances, including inks, paints, labels, and tape.\n\nThis
    document evaluates possible chemical interactions between enclosures and processed
    silver-gelatin and colour (dye-gelatin) images, and applies to all storage, display,
    and transport materials used for photographs whether intended for short or long-term
    use. A modified version of the document is applicable to diazo images. This document
    may apply to many historic photographic processes. \n\nThis document does not
    apply to other non-silver-gelatin imaging systems. It does not pertain to harmful
    physical interactions such as blocking (sticking together), dye bleed, adhesive
    migration, or plasticizer exudation. It does not pertain to important criteria
    of enclosures such as their inherent chemical stability, physical integrity, and
    workmanship. Passing the photographic activity test (PAT) does not indicate that
    a material is archival. This term has no clear definition and is not used in this
    document. Photo-safe storage enclosures and their components are covered in ISO
    18902, which supersedes the PAT and includes passing the criteria of PAT."
