    This International Standard specifies requirements for line pressure regulators and line pressure regulators with flow-metering devices to be connected to industrial gas distribution pipelines of
    - compressed gases and Carbon Dioxide up to 60 bar (6 MPa),

    - acetylene up to 1.5 bar (0.15 MPa),

    - liquefied petroleum gases (LPG),

    - methylacetylene-propadiene mixtures (MPS)

    for use in welding, cutting and allied processes.

    This International Standard does not cover pressure regulators intended for direct use on cylinders or bundles. Such regulators comply respectively with the safety requirements of ISO 2503 or ISO 7291.

    Note : Where there is no risk of ambiguity both line pressure regulators and line pressure regulators with flow-metering devices are addressed with the collective term ‘pressure regulators’.
