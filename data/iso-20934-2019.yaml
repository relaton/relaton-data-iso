    This document specifies fuse-links with axial terminals (Strip fuse-links) Types SF36‑70V, SF51‑70V and SF56‑70V used in road vehicles. It establishes, for these fuse-link types, the rated current, test procedures, performance requirements, and dimensions.
    This document is applicable to fuse-links with a rated voltage of 70 V DC, a rated current of 30 A to 500 A, and a breaking capacity of 2 500 A intended for use in the electrical system of road vehicles with a nominal voltage of 48 V DC.
    This document is intended to be used in conjunction with ISO 8820-1 and with ISO 8820-2. The numbering of its clauses corresponds to that of ISO 8820-1, whose requirements are applicable, except where modified by requirements particular to this document.
