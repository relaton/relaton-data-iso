  content: "This document specifies test methods and requirements for the strength
    and durability of all types of extension elements and their components for all
    fields of application, except table extensions.\n\nThe tests consist of the application
    of loads, forces and velocities simulating normal functional use, as well as misuse,
    that might reasonably be expected to occur.\n\nWith the exception of the corrosion
    test in 6.4, the tests are designed to evaluate properties without regard to materials,
    design/construction or manufacturing processes.\n\nThe strength and durability
    tests only relate to the extension elements and the parts used for the attachement,
    e.g. screws.\n\nThe strength and durability tests are carried out in a test frame
    with specified properties. The test results can only be used as a guide to the
    performance of a piece of furniture.\n\nThe test results are only valid for the
    extension element tested. These results may be used to represent the performance
    of production models provided that the tested model is representative of the production
    model. \n\nAgeing and influences of heat and humidity are not included."
