abstract:
- content: "This standard specifies the data exchange requirements between related
    systems within smart city for electric vehicle-based demand response services
    utilizing nomadic devices as follows:\n-\tDemand response for electric energy
    demand reduction during power system peak demand conditions and in response to
    fine dust warning issued according to air quality forecast\n-\tDemand response
    for electric energy demand increase, called “reverse demand response”, instead
    of curtailment during electric power over-generation by renewable energy generation
    systems such as solar and wind\nThis standard defines the requirements of main
    actors such as EV, smart city cloud, service provider, User nomadic and data platform
    to support EV-based demand response services. \nThis standard also defines data
    set and data processing procedure requirements for EV-based demand response services"
