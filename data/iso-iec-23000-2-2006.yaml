    ISO/IEC 23000-2:2006 specifies a method to import MPEG-1 Layer III coded media files (i.e. MP3) that may contain ID3V1 meta-data into the framework of MPEG-4 as an MPEG-4 file. Optionally, the media file can have an associated JPEG image (e.g. album cover art). The major components of the specification are:
    - a method to convert the Layer III bitstream into a series of MPEG-4 Access Units suitable for storage in an MPEG-4 file;
    - a method to represent the ID3V1 meta-data using a concise set of MPEG-7 constructs, and place that MPEG-7 description into the MPEG-4 file;
    - a method to encapsulate a JPEG compressed image into the MPEG-4 file.
    Additional components permit using the MPEG-21 file format, which supports a more precise association of coded audio, meta-data and image information, and also permits the creation of a music album via encapsulation of a set of MPEG-4 files (i.e. songs) within a single MPEG-21 file.
