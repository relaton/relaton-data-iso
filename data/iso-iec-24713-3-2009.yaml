  script: Latn
  content: In order to support a globally interoperable system of seafarers' identity
    documents, ISO/IEC 24713-3:2009 establishes a biometric profile to define how
    to use biometrics for verification and identification of seafarers at the various
    stages of document issuance and inspection. It defines a set of base standards
    and criteria for applying those standards in applications where identity documents
    are issued to seafarers and biometrics are used to link each document to the seafarer
    to whom it was issued. It attempts to provide information on the processes surrounding
    the enrolment and verification or identification of seafarers so that the biometric
    components of the system can be used in a proper context. It also addresses other
    system components such as the storage medium for the biometric data and the security
    of the system, since these will affect the use of the biometric technology.
