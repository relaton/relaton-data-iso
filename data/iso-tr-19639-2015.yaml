    Common payment scheme for multi-modal transport services, such as toll roads and public transport, are implemented all over the world. These systems are often based on a common payment medium, e.g. IC cards, for use in more than one transport service. The aim of ISO/TR 19639:2015 is to analyse the existing set of EFC standards for their suitability for using common payment media for multi-modal transport services, where applicable identify standardisation gaps and to make proposals for such EFC standardisation projects. This includes definition of additional information to be exchanged among the related entities and to define the specific requirements for common payment scheme.
    The scope of ISO/TR 19639:2015 includes:
    -        investigation of a suitable model for EFC systems and other transport services;
    -        identification of the required interface definitions between the EFC and the public transport services including e-money services;
    -        identification of additional needs for additional EFC related information exchange among the related entities;
    -        provision of guiding information to be considered in revisions of EFC standards.
    The scope includes all types of EFC systems, i.e. including both DSRC based EFC and autonomous EFC systems, and both pre-pay type and post-pay type.
    Service related information of both public transport and e-money are outside the scope of ISO/TR 19639:2015.
