  content: The temperature characterizes a certain glass transition range from the
    elastic brittle (low temperature) state to the viscous (high temperature) state
    of glass. It is used for specifying cooling programmes. The transformation temperature
    is determined by measuring the change in length, related to the length at intial
    temperature, of a rod made from the glass under test with temperature. The relative
    change in length is plotted against the temperature (dilatometer curve). From
    this dilatometer curve the transformation temperature is determined by a graphic
    procedure as shown in a diagramm.
