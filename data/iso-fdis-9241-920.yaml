  content: "This part of ISO 9241 gives recommendations for tactile/haptic hardware
    and software interactions. It provides guidance on the design and selection of
    hardware, software, and combinations of hardware and software interactions, including\n•\tthe
    design/use of tactile/haptic inputs, outputs, and/or combinations of inputs and
    outputs, with general guidance on their design/use as well as on designing/using
    combinations of tactile and haptic interactions for use in combination with other
    modalities or as the exclusive mode of interaction,\n•\tthe tactile/haptic encoding
    of information, including textual data, graphical data and controls,\n•\tthe design
    of tactile/haptic objects,\n•\tthe layout of tactile/haptic space, and\n•\tinteraction
    techniques.\n\nFor guidance and recommendations on the accessibility of tactile/haptic
    interactions, including information on the use of braille, see ISO 9241-971. It
    does not provide recommendations specific to braille but can apply to interactions
    that make use of braille.\n\nThe recommendations given in this part of ISO 9241
    are applicable to a variety of tactile/haptic devices, representing the real world
    or virtual or mixed realities (e.g. exoskeletons, wearables, force feedback devices,
    touchables, tangibles) and stimulation types (e.g. acoustic radiation pressure,
    electrical muscle stimulation) and they can also be found in virtual and augmented
    environments.\n\nThis document does not include guidance on the role of walking
    in virtual or mixed realities for tactile/haptic interaction.\n\nNOTE\tIt is recognized
    that some interactive scenarios might be constrained by the limitation that a
    real workspace is to be modelled in a virtual environment. Objects can be in suboptimal
    positions or conditions for haptic interaction by virtue of the situation being
    modelled.\n\nThis document provides general information about how various forms
    of interaction can be applied to various user tasks. The use of gestures (e.g.
    multitouch) can be found in ISO 9241-960. Information on gesture-based interfaces
    can be found in the multipart standard ISO/IEC 30113. Information on contactless
    gestures can be found in ISO TS 9241-430."
