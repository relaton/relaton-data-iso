    This document specifies the minimum performance requirements and methods of test for firehoods that cover the head and neck and are used for wildland firefighting. An optional requirement has been included to provide limited protection against particulate contaminants
    This document covers the general design of the PPE, the minimum levels of performance for the materials employed and the methods of test used. This PPE is not intended to provide protection during fire entrapment.
    This document does not cover firehoods for structural firefighting (see ISO 11999‑9). This document only applies in situations when compatible protective clothing, helmet, and when necessary respiratory protection devices are also worn.
