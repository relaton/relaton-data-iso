    ISO/IEC 7816-9:2017 specifies interindustry commands for card, file and other structure management, i.e. data object and security object. These commands cover the entire life cycle of the card and therefore some commands are used before the card has been issued to the cardholder or after the card has expired. For details on record life cycle status, refer to ISO/IEC 7816-4.
    ISO/IEC 7816-9:2017 is not applicable to the internal implementation within the card and/or the outside world.
