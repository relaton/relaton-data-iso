    ISO 5000:2011 specifies the characteristics of cold-reduced carbon steel sheet of commercial and drawing qualities coated by a continuous hot-dip aluminium-silicon alloy coating process.
    Aluminium-silicon-coated steel sheets are used for heat-resisting applications and also where both corrosion and heat resistance are required.
    The steel sheet is produced in a number of qualities, coating mass, grades, surface treatments and conditions designed to be compatible with differing application requirements.
    Aluminium-silicon-coated steel sheet can be ordered in one of two ordering conditions: a) condition A): steel ordered to satisfy mechanical property requirements; b) condition B): steel ordered to make an identified part.
