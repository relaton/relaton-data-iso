    1.1    This document specifies a procedure for the initial qualification of composite materials in order to allow quality control, material selection and preliminary design to be undertaken. It provides a single procedure allowing quicker and lower cost qualification compared to multiple bi-lateral qualification against different bespoke user needs. This document focuses on developing B-basis design allowables.
    1.2    The procedure comprises a standard qualification plan (SQP) that includes the minimum common test requirements for more highly anisotropic composite materials. Further test requirements are encompassed in an extended qualification plan (EQP), which includes options representing specific in-service features. A reduced qualification plan (RQP) scheme, using the same core structure of test plate preparation and test methods as the SQP, is available for less highly anisotropic and tending towards nominally isotropic composite materials.
    1.3    The procedure is suitable for fibre-reinforced thermoset, and thermoplastic, based material systems intended for structural or semi-structural applications. Individual test method standards referred to in this document provide more details as to the classes and types of composite materials that are covered in each case.
    1.4    Annexes A and B are included to support presentation of the data obtained in a consistent database and to provide statistical procedures for the determination of B-basis design allowables, respectively.
