    ISO 14469-3:2006 applies to compressed natural gas (CNG) vehicle nozzles and receptacles constructed entirely of new, unused parts and materials. CNG fuelling connection nozzles consist of the following components, as applicable:
    - receptacle and protective cap (mounted on vehicle);
    - nozzle.
    ISO 14469-3:2006 applies to devices which have a service pressure of 250 bar and refers only to a service pressure of 250 bar.
    This part of ISO 14469 applies to devices with standardized mating components and applies to connectors which:
    - prevent natural gas vehicles from being fuelled by dispenser stations with service pressures higher than that of the vehicle;
    - allow natural gas vehicles to be fuelled by dispenser stations with service pressures equal to or lower than the vehicle fuel system service pressure.
    ISO 14469-3:2006 is applicable to compressed natural gas in accordance with ISO 15403.
