    This document describes a building enclosure commissioning process to achieve a well performing, durable and maintainable building enclosure. This document includes procedures, methods and documentation requirements describing the application of the commissioning process to a building enclosure at each phase of a project. These project phases span from predesign through owner occupancy and operation. This process is referred to throughout this document as building enclosure commissioning (BECx).
    This document applies to new building construction and building re-commissioning. This document is for use by an owner, commissioning provider, building developer, owner's representative, construction manager, architect, contractor, and/or consultant, etc. Its purpose is to determine and complete the required tasks and activities to deliver a building enclosure which meets the performance requirements of the owner. Requirements for the project are established by the owner and/or commissioning provider (CxP).
    This document identifies steps necessary to perform a building enclosure risk analysis. The analysis will result in tasks that define the level of BECx, commensurate with the owner's tolerance for risk associated with building enclosure performance.
    The BECx process covered by this document is applicable to an individual assembly, a combination of assemblies or a whole enclosure assembly. For example, an individual assembly can be the fenestration, the air barrier or the thermal insulation. A combination of assemblies would include the fenestration, the air barrier and the complete heat transfer system, (e.g. both the insulation and roof assembly). A whole building enclosure assembly would include all heat, air and moisture control layers of the building enclosure, on all six sides of the building.
    This document describes requirements for any third-party consultants and/or building enclosure commissioning providers (BECxP) to document their technical qualifications, independence and knowledge of the BECx process, including their education, training, and experience.
