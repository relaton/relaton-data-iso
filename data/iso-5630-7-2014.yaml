  content: ISO 5630-7:2014 specifies a method for accelerating the ageing of paper
    and board through exposure to an elevated light irradiance and for assessing the
    effect of ageing on optical properties for the purpose of predicting stability
    to long-term natural ageing that occurs due to exposure to light. It is applicable
    to all types of paper and board whose surface is white or near white.
