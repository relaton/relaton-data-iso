abstract:
- content: "ISO 16587:2004 describes the performance parameters for assessing the
    condition of structures, including types of measurement, factors for setting acceptable
    performance limits, data acquisition parameters for constructing uniform databases,
    and internationally accepted measurement guidance (e.g. terminology, transducer
    calibration, transducer mounting and approved transfer function techniques).\nThe
    procedures relate to in-service monitoring of structures, and include all components
    and sub-assemblies necessary to provide the functioning of the structure as a
    complete entity. The monitoring is intended to be ongoing in nature through the
    lifecycle of the structure. \nThe target industries for ISO 16587:2004 include:
    construction, infrastructure, transportation, power generation, oil and gas, and
    leisure and entertainment.\nISO 16587:2004 is applicable to stationary structures,
    such as: buildings, bridges and tunnels, towers, masts and antennae, tanks and
    silos, retaining walls and dams, jetties and other shore-side structures, offshore
    platforms, pressure vessels, and pipelines. \nNon-stationary structures (e.g.
    self-propelled ships) and mobile structures (e.g. offshore jack-up platforms)
    are excluded from ISO 16587:2004."
