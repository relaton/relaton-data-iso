    ISO 11156:2011 provides a framework for design and evaluation of packages so that more people, including persons from different cultural and linguistic backgrounds, older persons and persons whose sensory, physical, and cognitive functions have been weakened or have allergies, can appropriately identify handle and use the contents. It considers varying aspects of the packaged product lifecycle from identification of the product and purchase and use of the product to the separation and disposal of the package.
    ISO 11156:2011 does not apply to dimensions, materials, manufacturing methods, or evaluation methods of individual packages.
