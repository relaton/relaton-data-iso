  content: This part of ISO specifies the dimensions ot two series of rectangular
    refractory bricks. These two series of bricks may be used in conjunction with
    the series of arch bricks whose dimensions are specified in ISO 5019/2. However,
    the sizes of refractory bricks here listed are only a limited number of the size
    currently in production in many countries, but it is believed that size specified
    in this document include those most commonly used in furnace construction.
