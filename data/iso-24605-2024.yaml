    This document applies only to dimethyl-ether refuelling connectors with a pressure-equalizing port, hereinafter referred to as devices, constructed entirely of new, unused parts and materials. Dimethyl-ether refuelling connectors with a pressure-equalizing port consist of the following components, as applicable:
    a)       nozzle with a pressure-equalizing port,
    The refuelling nozzle and pressure-equalizing port are integrated so that the connecting of the refuelling path and pressure-equalizing path is performed with a single action (mounted on the dispenser side) (see Clause 5).
    b)       receptacle with a pressure-equalizing port (mounted on vehicle) (see Clause 7).
    This document applies to devices which use dimethyl ether as fuel, hereinafter referred to in this document as M15 [see 9.2 c)]:
    This document applies to devices with standardised mating components.
    This document applies to connectors which prevent dimethyl-ether vehicles from being fuelled by fuel-station dispensers for other gaseous fuels.
    This document is applicable to dimethyl ether in accordance with ISO 16861.
    All references to pressures (kPa) throughout this document are considered gauge pressures unless otherwise specified.
