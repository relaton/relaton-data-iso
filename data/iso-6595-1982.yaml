  content: Describes a procedure for water and waste water. Is applicable to concentrations
    in the range from 0,001 to 0,1 mg/l. In case of compounds which are difficult
    to decompose a procedure of digestion is described in the annex. By suitable dilution
    of the test portion with arsenic-free water higher concentrations may also be
    determined.
