abstract:
- content: "This document specifies the requirements for quantifying the carbon footprint
    of those processes, materials and technologies within the user's knowledge and
    control that are necessary for the delivery and use of e-media. It covers requirements
    to account for e-media archiving, distribution, use and storage. It is based on
    a life cycle assessment (LCA) approach, using defined system boundaries and a
    specified functional unit as the basis for complete or partial carbon footprinting
    studies. These data can be referenced throughout supply chains for individual
    e-media products. \nThis document is applicable to a carbon footprint of a product
    (CFP) study of e-media regarding contents and e-media devices.\nThis document
    provides a framework for carbon calculators that organisations can follow and
    that can be used as the structure for market- or sector-specific carbon footprinting
    tools. Studies and tools constructed within this framework methodology provide
    carbon footprint quantifications of e-media that can be validated, verified and
    provide reference for future studies.\nThis document does not assess any social
    or economic aspects or impacts, or any other environmental aspects and related
    impacts potentially arising from the life cycle of a product."
