    ISO 8336:2017 specifies methods for the inspection and testing of fibre-cement flat sheets and provides the acceptance conditions for their use in one or more of the following applications:
    -      external wall and ceiling finishes;
    -      internal wall and ceiling finishes;
    -      internal and external backing sheets.

    NOTE 1    ISO 8336:2017 does not apply to sheets for fire protection purposes.
    NOTE 2    ISO 8336:2017 does not include calculations for installation design requirements, wind uplift or water proofing of the installed sheets.
    NOTE 3    ISO 8336:2017 does not apply to the following products:
    -      boards of Portland or equivalent cement reinforced with fibrous wood particles;
    -      fibre-reinforced boards of calcium silicate or cement for thermal insulation or fire protection;
