  content: |-
    ISO 11863:2011 specifies how to determine functional performance requirements (demand) for buildings and building-related facilities, and how to check the capability of buildings and facilities to meet identified requirements (supply). It specifies how to determine the relative importance of each requirement, establish thresholds for capability, and evaluate the significance of differences between what is required and actual capabilities.
    ISO 11863:2011 is applicable to any size or scope of assets of buildings and building-related facilities, e.g. to a portfolio of assets at a single site or multiple sites, to assets of a single small building, and to any constituent system, sub-system, component or element thereof. It is applicable to a range of roles, from owners and managers to occupants, tenants, or other users or stakeholders. It is applicable to any asset type within the field of buildings and civil engineering works, including certain public works, equipment and materiel. It is particularly useful for entities having control or occupancy of a portfolio of such assets.
