    This Document specifies a method for the determination of the gross calorific value of sludge at
    constant volume and at the reference temperature 25 °C in a bomb calorimeter calibrated by
    combustion of certified benzoic acid.
    The result obtained is the gross calorific value of the sample at constant volume with both the water of
    the combustion products and the moisture of the sludge as liquid water. In practice, sludge are burned
    at constant (atmospheric) pressure and the water is not condensed but is removed as vapour with the
    flue gases. Under these conditions, the operative heat of combustion to be used is the net calorific
    value of the fuel at constant pressure. In this European Standard the net calorific value at constant
    volume is described as it requires less additional determinations.
    This method is applicable to all kinds of sludge
