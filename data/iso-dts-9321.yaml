abstract:
- content: "This document specifies the general requirements for conducting a multi-center
    medical data collaborative analysis in aspects of system architecture, data storage,
    data standardization, data analysis, system features, functions requirements and
    security while the original medical data should be stored inside and cannot leave
    the local medical centers in any unencrypted formats. Data in this document mainly
    refers to electronic health records data for observational clinical cohort studies,
    including structured data, medical text data and image report data, etc. Purpose
    of using anonymization data is classified according to ISO/TS 14265:2011 for data
    consistency management. This document applies to researchers, developers, maintenance
    staffs and management personnel of multi-center medical data collaborative analysis
    systems, as well as decision makers of multi-center system design and planning,
    clinical researchers and third-party clinical data demander.\nThe potential uses
    for this document are to:\n-\tsupport developers of new medical data analysis
    platforms establishing distributed systems with compliant and secured framework.\n-\tsupport
    technicians in medical centers rapidly and safely linking their local medical
    resources into a collaborative analysis platform.\n-\tsupport supervisors in medical
    centers to manage the research processes.\n-\tsupport physicians and medical researchers
    conducting the collaborative analysis of multi-center medical data when the original
    medical data cannot leave the local medical centers in any unencrypted formats.\n-\tprovide
    a core set of functional requirements to ensure the major functionality and security
    while the functions of collaborative analysis platforms are gradually enriched."
