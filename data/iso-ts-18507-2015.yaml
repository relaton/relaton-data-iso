    ISO/TS 18507:2015 provides a framework on the uses of Total Reflection X-Ray Fluorescence (TXRF) spectroscopy for elemental qualitative and quantitative analysis of biological and environmental samples. It is meant to help technicians, biologist, doctors, environmental scientists, and environmental engineers to understand the possible uses of TXRF for elemental analysis by providing the guidelines for the characterization of biological and environmental samples with TXRF spectroscopy.
    Measurements can be made on equipment of various configurations, from laboratory instruments to synchrotron radiation beamlines or automated systems used in industry.
    ISO/TS 18507:2015 provides guidelines for the characterization of biological and environmental samples with TXRF spectroscopy. It includes the following: (a) description of the relevant terms; (b) sample preparation; (c) experimental procedure; (d) discussions on data analysis and result interpretation; (e) uncertainty; (f) case studies; and (g) references.
