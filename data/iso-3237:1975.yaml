  content: 'Applicable to the analysis of products manufactured by traditional methods
    provided that the impurities other than sulphates are well known. The gravimetric
    method shall be applied only in the case of doubt as to the accuracy of the calculated
    result. Principle of calculation: subtraction of the loss in mass at 110 °C, acid-insoluble
    matter, chlorides content (as NaCl), alkalinity (as Na2 CO3 ) or acidity (as H2
    SO4 ), expressed as percentages by mass. The chemical analysis follows the principle:
    extraction of a test portion with dilute acid, separation of the insoluble matter,
    precipitation of the sulphate in the filtrate with barium chlorid and weighing
    of the precipitate formed after drying.'
