abstract:
- content: |-
    This document specifies performance requirements for surrogate targets used to assess the system detection and performance of active safety systems.
    This document specifies the properties of an omni-directional multi-purpose vehicle target for assessment of interaction in a variety of traffic scenarios.
    This document specifies the properties of a vehicle target that will allow it to represent a passenger vehicle in terms of size, shape, reflection properties, etc. for testing purposes. This document addresses the detection requirements for a vehicle target in terms of sensing technologies commonly in use at the time of publication of this document, and where possible, anticipates future sensing technologies. It also addresses methodologies to verify the target response properties to these sensors, as well as performance requirements for the target carrier.
    The vehicle targets specified in this document reflect passenger cars and, in particular, the smaller and more common B and C segment cars.
    This document does not address the test procedures in terms of speeds, positions, or timing of events. Performance criteria for the active safety system are also not addressed.
