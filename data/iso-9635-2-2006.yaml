abstract:
- content: ISO 9635-2:2006 specifies construction and performance requirements and
    test methods for isolating valves, intended for operation in irrigation systems
    with water at temperatures not exceeding 60 °C, which can contain fertilizers
    and other chemicals of the types and concentrations used in agriculture. It is
    applicable to hydraulically operated isolating irrigation valves of DN 8 (1/4
    inch) diameter or greater, designed to operate in the fully open and fully closed
    positions, but which can also operate for extended time periods in any intermediate
    position.
