    This document specifies the methods for testing the environmental characteristics of RFID-enabled sporting goods.
    This document suggest methods for identifying the main use environments and related testing of environmental characteristics of sporting goods for indoor and outdoor sports with RFID and optionally additional advanced electronic devices like sensors.
    The environmental characteristics addressed in this document are applicable to manufacturers, including distribution and inventory management, as well as the aspects of consumer use of the actual RFID-enabled sports items. This document establishes methods to measure and evaluate the performance change of tags after environmental characteristic testing.
