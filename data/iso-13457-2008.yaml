abstract:
- content: "ISO 13457:2008 specifies the construction, operational requirements and
    test methods for water‑driven chemical injector pumps, used to inject chemicals
    into irrigation systems. The chemicals include liquid fertilizers and solutions
    of fertilizers and other soluble agricultural chemicals such as acids and pesticides.\nISO
    13457:2008 is applicable to those pumps intended to operate at water temperatures
    of up to 50 °C and with the types and concentrations of chemicals routinely applied
    in irrigation. \nIt does not cover the function of backflow prevention devices,
    nor is it applicable to water-driven devices for injecting chemicals into an irrigation
    system operating on the basis of the Venturi principle."
