abstract:
- content: This document specifies a substitution measurement method to measure internal
    quantum efficiency, external quantum efficiency and absorptance of ceramic phosphor
    powders, which are used in white light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and emit visible
    light when excited by UV or blue light. In this method, commercially available
    measurement equipment, such as a fluorescence spectrophotometer or a spectroradiometer
    equipped with a monochromatic light source as incident light, are used to measure
    fluorescence spectra for reference materials whose quantum efficiencies and absorptance
    have been determined using the methods in ISO 23946 and a phosphor material under
    test.
