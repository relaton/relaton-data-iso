  content: "ISO 14044 requires the goal and scope of an LCA to be clearly defined
    and be consistent with the intended application. Due to the iterative nature of
    LCA, it is possible that the LCA scope needs to be refined during the study.\nThis
    document specifies methodologies that can be applied to determine the carbon footprint
    of a product (CFP) or partial CFP of a hydrogen product in line with ISO 14067.
    The goals and scopes of the methodologies correspond to either approach a) or
    b), given below, that ISO 14040:2006, A.2 gives as two possible approaches to
    LCA.\na)    An approach that assigns elementary flows and potential environmental
    impacts to a specific product system, typically as an account of the history of
    the product.\nb)    An approach that studies the environmental consequences of
    possible (future) changes between alternative product systems.\nApproaches a)
    and b) have become known as attributional and consequential, respectively, with
    complementary information accessible in the ILCD handbook.[1] \nThere are numerous
    pathways to produce hydrogen from various primary energy sources. This document
    describes the requirements and evaluation methods applied to several hydrogen
    production pathways of interest: electrolysis, steam methane reforming (with carbon
    capture and storage), co-production and coal gasification (with carbon capture
    and storage), auto-thermal reforming (with carbon capture and storage), hydrogen
    as a co-product in industrial applications and hydrogen from biomass waste as
    feedstock. \nThis document also considers the GHG emissions due to the conditioning
    or conversion of hydrogen into different physical forms and chemical carriers:
    \n—    hydrogen liquefaction;\n—    production, transport and cracking of ammonia
    as a hydrogen carrier;\n—    hydrogenation, transport and dehydrogenation of liquid
    organic hydrogen carriers (LOHCs).\nThis document considers the GHG emissions
    due to hydrogen and/or hydrogen carriers’ transport up to the consumption gate.\nIt
    is possible that future revisions of this document will consider additional hydrogen
    production, conditioning, conversion and transport methods.\nThis document applies
    to and includes every delivery along the supply chain up to the final delivery
    to the consumption gate (see Figure 2 in the Introduction). \nThis document also
    provides additional information related to evaluation principles, system boundaries
    and expected reported metrics in the form of Annexes A to K, that are accessible
    via the online ISO portal (https://standards.iso.org/iso/ts/19870/ed-1/en)."
