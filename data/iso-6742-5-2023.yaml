    This document is applicable to lighting systems used on cycles intended to be used on public roads and, especially, bicycles complying with ISO 4210[1] and ISO 8098[2].
    This document specifies requirements and test methods for the performance of lighting systems not powered by the cycle’s movement. It applies to lighting and light signalling devices complying with ISO 6742‑1. Lighting systems include lighting and light signalling devices and power not supplied by cycle's movement such as battery.
