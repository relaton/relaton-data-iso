abstract:
- content: "1.1 General\nTraditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is a form of traditional
    medicine that originated in China, and is\ncharacterized by holism and treatment
    based on pattern identification/syndrome differentiation. The\nTechnical Specification
    establishes common concepts and a vocabulary for describing the complex\ndomain
    of various Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) informatics standards initiatives
    and their\nsupporting artefacts. It provides a useful profiling framework to align
    existing and developing TCM\ninformatics standards and to reference health informatics
    standards. It promotes the reuse of TCM\ninformatics knowledge and improves the
    identification of opportunities for TCM informatics standards\nalignment, collaboration,
    and coordination.\nTopics considered outside the scope of this Technical Specification
    include:\n— profiling framework and classification for informatics standards of
    Kampo, Korean medicine, and\nother traditional medicine.\n1.2 Main purpose\nThe
    framework has been developed to address different needs of TCM informatics and
    compare with\nhealth informatics standards. The specific needs addressed in this
    Technical Specification are the\nfollowing:\n— provide the capability to comprehensively
    define and classify TCM informatics standards artefacts;\n— facilitate the coordination,
    communication, and comparability of TCM informatics standards\nthrough a common
    understanding of intended users and content;\n— help identify and coordinate TCM
    informatics standards development;\n— promote TCM informatics standards integration
    and alignment within and between standards from\ndifferent Standards Development
    Organizations (SDOs); and\n— provide a framework to assist with the coordination
    of ISO/TC 215 work items both within the\ntechnical committee and with related
    TCs, including ISO/TC 249 and ISO/TC 46.\n1.3 Benefits\nThe potential benefits
    of the Technical Specification include the following:\n— introduction of classification
    concepts and terminology for TCM informatics standard artefacts;\n— enhancement
    of TCM informatics standards development coordination through the identification
    of\npotential duplication between standards initiatives;\n\uFEFF\n— enhancement
    of global understanding of TCM informatics standards in support of their knowledge\nmanagement.\n1.4
    Target groups\nThe target groups include the following:\n— managers and reviewers
    of TCM informatics standards;\n— developers of TCM informatics standards;\n— users
    of TCM informatics standards."
