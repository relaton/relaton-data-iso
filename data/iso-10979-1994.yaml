  content: Specifies requirements for the unique identification. Was developed primarily
    for commercial light-water reactor fuel, but may be used for any reactor fuel
    contained in discrete fuel assemblies that can be identified with an identification
    code. Defines the characters and proposed sequence to be used in assigning identification
    to the fuel assemblies. The identification is intended to be borne by the fuel
    assembly throughout its lifetime. Aims at providing an organizing principle for
    fuel assembly identification systems in order to guarantee unequivocal identification
    at any time and any place in the world.
