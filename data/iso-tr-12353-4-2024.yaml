    This document compiles common methods for assessing the effectiveness of vehicle safety systems. This covers active, passive and integrated safety systems including crash avoidance systems.
    Effectiveness in this context refers to the capability of a safety system or feature to avoid or mitigate injuries, fatalities or crashes.
    The document covers both prospective and retrospective methodologies. Applicability, advantages, limitations, accuracy and sensitivity are described for each method. Necessary input and output data and format are also presented.
