    ISO/TR 11044:2008 discusses scientific and technical aspects that have been considered in connection with the development of batch algal growth inhibition test procedures specified in ISO 8692, for freshwater, and ISO 10253, for marine waters.
    Previously unpublished results of experiments performed at the Norwegian Institute for Water Research (NIVA) have been included to demonstrate various aspects.
