    ISO 4996:2007 applies to hot-rolled steel sheet of high yield stress structural quality with the use of microalloying elements. The product is intended for structural purposes where particular mechanical properties are required. It is generally used in the delivered condition and is intended for structures that may include bolting, riveting and welding.
    ISO 4996:2007 does not cover steel intended for boilers or pressure vessels, steels designated as commercial quality or drawing quality (ISO 3573:1999), steels to be rerolled to cold-reducing products, steels designated as weathering steels, having increased atmospheric corrosion resistance, or steels having improved formability properties compared with those in ISO 4996:2007.
