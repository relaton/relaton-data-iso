  content: "ISO 9050:2003 specifies methods of determining light and energy transmittance
    of solar radiation for glazing in buildings. These characteristic data can serve
    as a basis for light, heating and ventilation calculations of rooms and can permit
    comparison between different types of glazing.\nISO 9050:2003 is applicable both
    to conventional glazing units and to absorbing or reflecting solar-control glazing,
    used as glazed apertures. The appropriate formulae for single, double and triple
    glazing are given. Furthermore, the general calculation procedures for units consisting
    of more than components are established. \nISO 9050:2003 is applicable to all
    transparent materials. One exception is the treatment of the secondary heat transfer
    factor and the total solar energy factor for those materials that show significant
    transmittance in the wavelength region of ambient temperature radiation (5 microns
    to 50 microns), such as certain plastic sheets."
