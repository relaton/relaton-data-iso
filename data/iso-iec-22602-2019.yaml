abstract:
- content: |-
    This document specifies the description of entities of the real world dealing with competencies, competencies description, competencies evaluation, and of the operations done by these entities on competencies.
    This document provides a model to express all information required for the exchange and integration of heterogeneous descriptions of "competency" and of heterogeneous "competency objects":
    —          any item of discourse in the real world related to "competency" has a representation preserving its meaning in the proposed model;
    —          this representation allows comparison, hierarchical classification and aggregation of different items of discourse related to "competency".
    The concrete content of items of discourse in the real world related to "competency" is not specified in this document, which only deals with the formal expression of the discourse.
