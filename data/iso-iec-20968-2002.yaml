  content: "ISO/IEC 20968:2002 specifies the set of definitions, conventions and activities
    of the MkII FPA Functional Size Measurement Method.\nThe method can be used to
    measure the functional size of any software application that can be described
    in terms of logical transactions, each comprising an input, process and output
    component. The sizing rules were designed to apply to application software from
    the domain of business information systems, where the processing component of
    each transaction tends to be dominated by considerations of the storage or retrieval
    of data. \nThe method may be applicable to software from other domains, but the
    user should note that the sizing rules do not take into account contributions
    to size such as from complex algorithms as typically found in scientific and engineering
    software, nor do the rules specifically take into account real-time requirements\nMK
    II FPA is independent of the project management method to be used and of the development
    method employed. It is a measure of the logical, business requirements, independent
    of how they are implemented."
