- content: |-
    This document specifies the performance requirements and test methods for optical harnesses for up to 100 Gbit/s per fibre channel for in-vehicle data communication between electronic devices including in-line connections. The optical harness consists of cables and connectors, including cable to cable (in-line) connectors and electronic device (header) connectors. Safety (electrical safety, protection, fire, etc.) and electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) requirements are outside the scope of this document.
    Specific to the optical header connector, only mechanical reference plane (MRP), optical reference plane (ORP) and relevant mechanical dimensions are within the scope of this document.
    The optical coupling system inside an optical header connector and the optoelectronic component itself are beyond the scope of this document.
