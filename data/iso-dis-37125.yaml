  content: A city’s Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) profile is fundamental
    in building a sustainable, inclusive, and resilient future. This Standard creates
    an ESG indicators framework, that is designed to support city leaders to address
    risk, improve decision-making and enhance their ESG profile once equipped with
    high calibre data that is generated with globally standardized key performance
    indicators (KPIs).  Cities are increasingly on the frontline in delivering services
    that protect the environment, consider equity and social needs, and prioritize
    social responsibility, underpinned by a strong model of governance and enduring
    legislation. This Standard will equip city leaders with data to nurture prosperous,
    inclusive, and livable cities, with a high quality of life for its residents,
    now, and into the future.
