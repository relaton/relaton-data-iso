abstract:
- content: "This document specifies how to extend the specification contained in ISO
    32000-2 by adding extensions to the Encrypt dictionary to support the Advanced
    Encryption Standard (AES)-Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) encryption algorithm.\nThese
    extensions are intended for developers of: \n¾    software that creates PDF files
    (PDF writers);\n¾     software that reads existing PDF files and (usually) interprets
    their contents for display (PDF readers);\n¾     software that reads and displays
    PDF content and interacts with the computer users to possibly modify and save
    the PDF file (interactive PDF processors) and PDF products that read and/or write
    PDF files for a variety of other purposes (PDF processors). \nNOTE       PDF writers
    and PDF readers are more specialized classifications of interactive PDF processors
    and all are PDF processors.\nThis document does not specify the following:\n—   
    specific processes for converting paper or electronic documents to the PDF file
    format;\n—    specific technical design, user interface implementation, or operational
    details of rendering;\n—    specific physical methods of storing these documents
    such as media and storage conditions;\n—    methods for validating the conformance
    of PDF files or PDF processors;\n—    required computer hardware and/or operating
    system."
