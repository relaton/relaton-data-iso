abstract:
- content: "This International Standard applies to positive displacement compressors
    as covered by ISO 1217, low pressure compressors as covered by NP 22484 and centrifugal
    compressors as covered by ISO 18740. \nThis International Standard defines and
    describes the acceptance test for Cycle Energy Requirement of a compressor. It
    specifies the operating and testing conditions which apply when a full test is
    specified. \nCycle Energy Requirement is the additional energy required for a
    single cycle caused by transient conditions."
