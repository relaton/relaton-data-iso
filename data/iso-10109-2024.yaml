    This document contains tables for environmental tests and test parameters which can be used as a guideline for the selection of environmental tests. These include the selection of standardized tests according to ISO 9022 as well as additional parameters not described in ISO 9022 and necessary for the optical or photonic instruments. Ultimately, these tables specify the requirements to be met with regard to the reliability of the optical, mechanical, chemical, and electrical properties or performance characteristics of the instruments when exposed to environmental influences.
    Environmental test methods, as specified in ISO 9022 (all parts), can be assigned to the various areas of application for the purpose of ascertaining the suitability of the instruments in the respective area of application.
