    This document specifies the elimination techniques for removing fine bubbles from fine bubble dispersion in water and how to optimize the elimination procedures to obtain better efficiency.
    This document is applicable to fine uncoated bubbles (without shells).
    It does not apply to fine coated bubbles (with shells).
    NOTE       Fine bubbles dispersed in liquid are classified into “fine bubble with shells” and “fine bubble without shells”. Fine bubble with shells means the fine bubble whose surface/interface is covered almost completely by an object or a collection of objects.
