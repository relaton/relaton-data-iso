abstract:
- content: Applicable to products having F contents of more than 0.003 % (m/m). Dissolution
    of a test portion by attack by sulphuric acid under pressure. Separation of the
    fluorine by distillation at a temperature of (150 1) °C by sulphuric acid. The
    distillation is carried out by the method described in ISO 1693. Formation of
    a blue coloured complex between fluorine and alizarin complexone/lanthanum chloride
    reagent at a pH between 4.5 and 4.6. Addition of acetone to increase the stability
    and sensitivity of the fluorine complex. Spectrophotometric measurement of the
    complex at a wavelength of about 620 nm. Has also been approved by the IUPAC.
