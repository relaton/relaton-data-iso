abstract:
- content: "ISO 21501-1:2009 specifies characteristics of a light scattering aerosol
    spectrometer (LSAS) which is used for measuring the size, number concentration
    and number/size distribution of particles suspended in a gas. The light scattering
    technique described in this document is based upon single particle measurements.
    The size range of particles measured by this method is between approximately 0,06
    µm to 45 µm in diameter. \nInstruments that conform to ISO 21501-1:2009 are used
    for the determination of the particle size distribution and particle number concentration
    at relatively high concentrations of up to 1011 particles/m3. \nApplication fields
    include: characterization of metered dose inhalers (MDI), dry powder inhalers
    (DPI) and nebulizers in pharmacy; production control of active agents; cut-off
    determination: impactors, cyclones and impingers; atmospheric aerosols: bio-aerosols,
    stables/composting facilities, nebulized droplets, measurements in street tunnels;
    fractional separation efficiency determination of filters.\nFor the above-mentioned
    applications, aerosol spectrometers should determine the particle size distribution,
    particle number concentration, size resolution and sizing accuracy as accurately
    as possible. These aerosol spectrometers are not suitable for the classification
    of clean rooms."
