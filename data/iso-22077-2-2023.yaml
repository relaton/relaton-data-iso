    This document defines the application of medical waveform format encoding rules (MFER) to describe standard electrocardiography waveforms measured in physiological laboratories, hospital wards, clinics, and primary care medical checkups. It covers electrocardiography such as 12-lead, 15-lead, 18-lead, Cabrera lead, Nehb lead, Frank lead, XYZ lead, and exercise tests that are measured by inspection equipment such as electrocardiographs and patient monitors that are compatible with MFER.
    Medical waveforms that are not in the scope of this document include Holter ECG, exercise stress ECG, and real-time ECG waveform encoding used for physiological monitors.
