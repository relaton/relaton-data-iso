    ISO 15830-2:2013 specifies requirements for mechanical components, drawings and specifications, validation tests, and support equipment for the WorldSID 50th percentile side-impact dummy, a standardized anthropomorphic dummy for side-impact testing of road vehicles. It is applicable to impact tests involving
    -passenger vehicles of category M1 and goods vehicles of category N1,
    -impacts to the side of the vehicle structure, and
    -impact tests involving use of an anthropomorphic dummy as a human surrogate for the purpose of evaluating compliance with vehicle safety standards.
