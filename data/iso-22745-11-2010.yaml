    ISO 22745-11:2010 provides guidelines that are recommended for the
    development of terminology for concepts in an open technical
    dictionary (OTD).
    Compliance with these guidelines is not required in order for a
    term or definition to be included in an OTD. These guidelines are
    provided as a framework for developers of industrial terminology to
    ensure that definitions are consistent and understandable.
    Terminology that complies with these guidelines will be marked as
    such in the OTD. This will allow a user to perform a search that
    filters terminology based on compliance with ISO 22745-11:2010.
