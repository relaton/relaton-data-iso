abstract:
- content: This document specifies technical requirements for thermoplastics lined
    tubing used in the petroleum and natural gas industries, including configuration
    and materials, manufacturing, inspection and testing, marking, packaging, transportation,
    and storage. The thermoplastic lined tubing is suitable for extracting multiphase
    fluid, hydrocarbon liquid, gases, and water under corrosive, abrasive, wax dipositive,
    and scaling environments. Thermoplastics in this document considered includes,
    but is not limited to, high-density polyethylene (HDPE), ultra high molecular
    weight polyethylene (UHMWPE), polyphenylene sulfide (PPS) and polyetheretherketone
    (PEEK), which satisfies the appropriate design codes, standards or regulations.
