abstract:
- content: 'ISO 24531:2007 has been developed to assist developers and users of intelligent
    transport systems (ITS) standards who wish to use extensible markup language (XML),
    by providing a consistent definition of the rules and rule references for the
    use of XML within intelligent transport systems. The scope of ISO 24531:2007 is
    to define consistent rules and rule references to provide a framework to be used
    when implementing XML-based applications in ITS, and particularly, in specifying
    XML in ITS standards, ITS data registries and ITS data dictionaries. ISO 24531:2007
    also provides guidance and examples in respect of the use of XML in ITS, and the
    elaboration of XML within the abstract syntax notation one (ASN.1) data definitions
    required by ISO 14813-6 and ISO 14817. '
