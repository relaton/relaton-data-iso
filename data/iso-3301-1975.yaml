abstract:
- content: A method is specified for comparing the mean of a population of differences
    with zero or any other preassigned value. It may be applied to establish a difference
    between two treatments, where "treatment" should be understood in a wide sense,
    e.g. as a test method, measuring instrument or laboratory involved, and is applicable
    under the conditions that the series of differences can be considered as a series
    of independent random items and the distribution of the differences is normal
    or approximately normal. If the distribution deviates from the normal, it remains
    valid provided the sample size is sufficiently large (100 and more).
