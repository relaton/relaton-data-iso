  content: |-
    ISO/TR 37152:2016 outlines the basic concept of a common framework for the development and operation of smart community infrastructures. The framework describes the planning, development, operation and maintenance methodology to facilitate the harmonization of each infrastructure as a part of a smart community and ensures that the interactions between multiple infrastructures are well orchestrated.
    The framework is applicable to all processes of smart community infrastructures' life cycle (from conceptual design through planning, development, operation, maintenance, redevelopment and feedback). The infrastructures to be covered are energy, water, transportation, waste management, ICT and others.
    The framework can be adopted by all relevant stakeholders who are engaged in planning, development and operation of smart community infrastructures, including planners, developers, business operators and suppliers. The framework is intended to cover the processes in which these stakeholders are engaged, such as management, organizational structure, analyses and design methods, and documentations.
