    ISO 13628-5:2002 specifies requirements and gives recommendations for the design, material selection, manufacture, design verification, testing, installation and operation of subsea control systems, chemical injection, gas lift, utility and service umbilicals and associated ancillary equipment for the petroleum and natural gas industries.
    ISO 13628-5:2002 applies to umbilicals containing electrical conductors, optical fibres, thermoplastic hoses and metallic tubes, either alone or in combination.
    ISO 13628-5:2002 applies to umbilicals that are for static or dynamic service, and with routings of surface- surface, surface-subsea and subsea-subsea.
    ISO 13628-5:2002 does not apply to the associated component connectors, unless they affect the performance of the umbilical or that of its ancillary equipment.
