abstract:
- content: ISO 17894:2005 provides a set of mandatory principles, recommended criteria
    and associated guidance for the development and use of dependable marine programmable
    electronic systems for shipboard use. It applies to any shipboard equipment containing
    programmable elements which may affect the safe or efficient operation of the
    ship. It contains information for all parties involved in the specification, operation,
    maintenance and assessment of such systems. The principles and guidance in the
    document are largely based on requirements in national and international standards.
    The source standards and their contribution to this International Standard are
