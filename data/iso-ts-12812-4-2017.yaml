    ISO/TS 12812-4:2017 provides comprehensive requirements and recommendations, as well as specific use cases for implementation of interoperable mobile payments-to-persons.
    The emphasis is placed on the principles governing the operational functioning of mobile payments-to-persons systems and processes, as well as the presentation of the underlying technical, organizational, business, legal and policy issues, leveraging legacy infrastructures of existing payment instruments (see ISO 12812‑1:2017, Annex C).
    ISO/TS 12812-4:2017  includes the following items:
    a)    requirements applicable to mobile payments-to-persons;
    b)    recommendations regarding mechanisms involved in the operation of interoperable mobile payments-to-persons;
    c)    a description of the different use cases for mobile payments-to-persons;
    d)    a generic interoperability model for the provision of different mobile payments-to-persons;
    e)    recommendations for the technical implementation of the generic architectures for the mobile payments-to-persons program;
    f)     recommendations for mobile remittances;
    g)    use cases with the corresponding transaction flows;
    h)    discussion of the financial inclusion of unbanked and underbanked persons (Annex A);
    i)     some legal aspects to consider for mobile payments-to-persons (Annex B).
    ISO/TS 12812-4:2017 is structured as follows:
    -      Clause 6 sets forth the requirements that a mobile payments-to-persons program must comply with.
    -      Clauses 7, 8 and 9 provide the different levels of implementation for the interoperability of mobile payments-to-persons.
    -      Clause 7 describes the interoperability principles for mobiles payments-to-persons.
    -      Clause 8 describes:
    -      Clause 9 provides a step-by-step data flow description for different mobile payments-to-persons implementations: bank-centric, non-bank centric and card-centric. They can be mapped into the processing use cases of Clause 8, where abstraction is made in the nature of the payment service providers.
