    This document specifies a classification, technical requirements and test methods, as well as designation, marking and documentation requirements for mooring positioning windlasses and winches of mobile offshore floating units, including drill-ships, semi-submersible drilling rigs, production platforms and offshore accommodation platforms.
    It can be used as a reference for ship-shifting positioning winches of pipelaying, crane and pile-driving vessels.
    This document is applicable to the design, manufacturing and acceptance testing of mooring positioning windlasses and winches.
