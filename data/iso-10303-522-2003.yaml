    ISO 10303-522:2003 specifies the interpretation of the integrated resources to satisfy requirements for machining feature use across a range of application protocols. The product data is based on existing part designs that have their shapes represented by machining features. ISO 10303-522:2003 supports digital representation for computer integrated manufacturing.
    The following are within the scope of ISO 10303-522:2003:
    - features that are to be manufactured by either milling or turning processes;
    - machining features for defining shapes necessary for manufacturing;
    NOTE The machining feature set is defined in ISO 10303-224.
    - machining feature definition elements necessary for creating machining features;
    - shape representations necessary for creating machining features;
    - features that can be replicated in patterns;
    - implicit representation of machining features through selection of standard parameters.
    The following are outside the scope of ISO 10303-522:2003:
    - feature order or sequence;
    - design features of a part.
