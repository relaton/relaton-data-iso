    ISO 19933:2007 provides a specific format to report the test process and results of spacecraft (SC) qualification to the launch environment. The following types of tests are considered:
    - static load;
    - modal survey;
    - sine vibration;
    - acoustic noise;
    - random vibration;
    - shock; and
    - electromagnetic compatibility (EMC).
    The definition of test specifications and test requirements are derived from launch vehicle (LV) user's manuals as defined in ISO 14303. Only those tests that are intended to demonstrate the compliance of a given SC design with its LV environment are taken into consideration.
