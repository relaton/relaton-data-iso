    ISO/TR 19473:2015 provides the best practices for orbit elements at payload-LV separation. It includes orbit elements and calculation conditions, calculation method of orbit elements and their errors at elliptical orbit insertion of various payloads. The fit between the actual and expected values of orbit elements can be used as a criterion of commercial launch.
    There are many different sets of orbit elements. Each is best suited for a particular application. The traditionally used set of orbital elements is called the set of Keplerian elements. ISO/TR 19473:2015 gives the calculation method of Keplerian elements and the transformation method of all the other orbit elements, in order to satisfy different user's need.
    Affected by terrestrial gravitational perturbation, lunisolar gravitation perturbation and other factors, orbit elements change slowly after orbit injection. Orbit elements calculation methods after separation are not included in this Technical Report.
    The technical communication and specific progress for orbit elements is relatively easy to be agreed on by applying this ISO/TR 19473:2015, which can contribute to avoiding possible disputes.
