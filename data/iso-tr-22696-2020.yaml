  content: "The document gives guidance for managing healthcare service security using
    connectable personal health devices. This document considers unidirectional data
    uploading from the PHD to the gateway (manager device), however, there are many
    clinical use cases for bidirectional data exchange.\nThis document is applicable
    to identification and authentication between the bidirectionally connected PHDs
    and gateway by providing possible use cases and the associated threats and vulnerabilities.
    Since some smart devices with mobile healthcare apps and software might connect
    to the healthcare service network, these devices will be considered connectable
    PHDs in this document. This document addresses those devices used in a homecare
    setting, where the knowledge and capabilities regarding the use of PHDs might
    not be as advanced as in other healthcare settings.\nThis document excludes specific
    protocols, methods and technical solutions for identification and authentication. "
