  content: "ISO 10416:2002 provides procedures for the laboratory testing of both
    drilling fluid materials and drilling fluid physical, chemical and performance
    properties. It is applicable to both water-based and oil-based drilling fluids,
    as well as the base or make-up fluid. \nIt is not intended as a detailed manual
    on drilling fluid control procedures. Recommendations regarding agitation and
    testing temperature are presented because the agitation history and temperature
    have a profound effect on drilling fluid properties. "
