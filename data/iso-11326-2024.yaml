abstract:
- content: This document specifies general inspection and test requirements for liquid
    hydrogen cargo tanks on board hydrogen carrier ships. In the cases of liquefied
    hydrogen containment systems, the testing activity depends strictly on the type
    of storage containment technology identified by the International Code for the
    Construction and Equipment of Ships Carrying Liquefied Gases in Bulk (IGC Code).[1]
    This document is applicable to Type C independent metallic double wall type tanks
    with vacuum insulation having a capacity of not more than 1 000 cubic metres (m3).
    It is also applicable to liquid hydrogen cargo tanks which are designed to transport
    pure para-hydrogen (not less than 95 % content).
