    This part of ISO/IEC 9314 specifies the Station Management (SMT) for the Fibre Distributed Data
    Interface (FDDI).
    FDDI provides a high bandwidth (100 megabits per second) general purpose interconnection among
    computers and peripheral equipment using optical fibre as the transmission medium in a ring
    configuration. FDDI can be configured to support a sustained transfer rate of approximately
    80 megabits (10 megabytes) per second. The use of dual attachment stations with dual MACs allows
    these rates to be doubled under the circumstance of a fault-free FDDI ring.
    FDDI establishes the connection among many stations (nodes) distributed over distances of several
    kilometres in extent. Default values for FDDI were calculated on the basis of 1 000 physical
    connections and a total fibre path length of 200 km.
    The FDDI consists of
    a) A Physical Layer (PL), which provides the medium, connectors, optical bypassing,
    and driver/receiver requirements. PL also defines encode/decode and clock
    requirements as required for framing the data for transmission on the medium or to
    the higher layers of the FDDI. For the purposes of this part of ISO/IEC 9314,
    references to the PL are made in terms of the Physical Layer protocol (PHY) and the
    Physical Layer Media Dependent (PMD) entities which are the upper and lower
    sublayers of PL, respectively.
    b) A Data Link Layer (DLL) which controls the accessing of the medium and the
    generation and verification of frame check sequences to assure the proper delivery
    of valid data to the higher layers. DLL also concerns itself with the generation and
    recognition of device addresses and the peer-to-peer associations within the FDDI
    network. For the purposes of this part of ISO/IEC 9314, references to the DLL are
    made in terms of the Media Access Control (MAC) entity which is the lowest
    sublayer of DLL.
    c) A Station Management (SMT) standard, this part of ISO/IEC 9314, which provides
    the control necessary at the station (node) level to manage the processes underway
    in the various FDDI layers such that a station may work cooperatively as a part of
    an FDDI network. SMT shall provide services such as connection management,
    station insertion and removal, station initialization, configuration management, fault
    isolation and recovery, communications protocol for external authority, scheduling
    policies, and collection of statistics.
    The definition of SMT as contained herein includes the set of services that it provides for, and receives
    from, the other entities that are contained within a node. Within SMT resides both knowledge of the
    uniqueness of this node and the current network structure to the extent that this node's function is
    affected.
    The set of International Standards for FDDI, ISO/IEC 9314, specifies the interfaces, functions and
    operations necessary to insure interoperability between conforming FDDI implementations. This part
    of ISO/IEC 9314 is a functional description. Conforming implementations may employ any design
    technique which does not violate interoperability.
