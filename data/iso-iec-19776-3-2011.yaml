  content: "ISO/IEC 19775, Extensible 3D (X3D), defines a system that integrates three-dimensional
    graphics and multimedia. Conceptually, each X3D file is a 3D time-based space
    that contains graphic and aural objects that can be dynamically modified through
    a variety of mechanisms. ISO/IEC 19776-3:2011 defines a mapping of the abstract
    objects in X3D to a specific X3D encoding written out in a compact binary form.\nEach
    X3D file encoded using the compressed binary encoding:\n- supports all of the
    purposes of X3D files defined in the X3D abstract specification ISO/IEC 19775;
    \n- encodes X3D constructs in a compressed binary format, taking advantage of
    geometric and information-theoretic compression techniques. \nX3D files encoded
    using the compressed binary encoding may be referenced from files using other
    X3D encodings, and may themselves reference other X3D files encoded using other
    X3D encodings. Sets of X3D files that use multiple encodings can only be processed
    by browsers that support all of the utilized X3D encodings."
