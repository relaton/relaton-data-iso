    This document defines basic considerations and decision-making for the specification of repair remedies, and management strategies for reinforced and unreinforced concrete structures. This document covers only atmospherically exposed structures, and buried or submerged structures, if they can be accessed.
    This document specifies repair design principles, and strategies for defects and on-going deterioration including, but not limited to:
    a)       mechanical actions, e.g. impact, overloading, movement caused by settlement, blast, vibration and seismic actions;
    b)       chemical and biological actions from environments, e.g. sulfate attack, alkali-aggregate reaction;
    c)        physical actions, e.g. freeze–thaw, thermal cracking, moisture movement, salt crystallization, fire, and erosion;
    d)       reinforcement corrosion;
    e)       original construction defects that remained unaddressed from the time of construction.
    The execution of maintenance and repairs is covered in ISO 16311-4.
