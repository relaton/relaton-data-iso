abstract:
- content: This document establishes a scheme for the marking of components (other
    than pipelines, hoses and fittings) used in aircraft hydraulic systems, so that
    the correct type of fluid is readily apparent during any assembly or testing operations
    in workshops. The marking is not intended to serve any purpose when a component
    is installed in an aircraft.
