    ISO 15928-5:2013 sets out a method for describing the operating energy performance of houses. It covers user needs, provides performance descriptions and outlines evaluation processes. It includes the description of relevant parameters for external and internal climatic conditions, user functional requirements, energy used by the house and energy generated by the house.
    ISO 15928-5:2013 is intended to be used for houses that may be separated from, or linked horizontally to, another house(s). Where houses are linked, and some sharing of services occurs, it is intended that energy usage performance may be assessed both for individual houses, as well as a group of houses that are linked together.
