  content: ISO 799:2004 specifies requirements for a ship's pilot ladder which is
    provided to enable a maritime pilot to embark and disembark a ship safely along
    a vertical portion of the ship's hull. It is applicable to merchant ships which
    embark and disembark maritime pilots with the ship underway. National maritime
    safety administrations are urged to accept ladders complying with ISO 799:2004
    on their ships, as complying fully with the requirements of the 1974 International
    Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS), as amended.
