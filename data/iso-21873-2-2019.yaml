    This document establishes the safety requirements for mobile crushers, as defined in ISO 21873‑1, for crushing rocks or for reprocessing construction materials and capable of re-location between worksites.
    It applies to mobile crushers that are either
    —          self-propelled (mounted on a chassis);
    —          lorry (truck) mounted;
    —          or semi-trailer mounted.
    It does not apply to
    —          fixed (stationary) crushers;
    —          large mining-type movable crushers.
    This document deals with significant hazards, hazardous situations and events relevant to mobile crushers when used as intended and under the conditions of misuse which are reasonably foreseeable by the manufacturer.
    This document is not applicable to machines which are manufactured before the date of its publication.
