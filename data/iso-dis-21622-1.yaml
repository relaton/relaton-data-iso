abstract:
- content: "The scope of this NWIP is to develop standards related to the remote monitoring
    and control for irrigation systems, using different technologies.\nThis part of
    the standard is intended to define the general considerations applicable to all
    kind of RMCS used in irrigation. \nAdditionally, the document includes some specific
    clauses intended to any RMCS that includes, totally or partially, controllers
    developed for irrigation. These controllers should be understood as specific hardware
    developments designed to the particular irrigation monitoring and/or control requirements.
    \nIt will be clearly identified at the beginning of each clause when it is specific
    for controllers developed for irrigation"
