    ISO 25537:2008 specifies the minimum quality requirements (regarding optical, visual and edge faults) and durability tests for silvered float glass for internal use in buildings.
    ISO 25537:2008 applies only to mirrors from silvered glass manufactured from flat, annealed clear or tinted float glass, from 2 mm to 6 mm thick, and supplied in stock/standard sizes and as-cut finished sizes to which no further processing (such as edgework or other fabrication) has been done.
    Upon consultation with the mirror manufacturer, it is possible to apply this International Standard to float glass having a thickness less than 2 mm or greater than 6 mm.
    ISO 25537:2008 covers the quality requirements of silvered, annealed, monolithic, clear and tinted flat glass mirrors.
    Mirrors covered in ISO 25537:2008 are not intended for use in environments, e.g. horse-riding halls, swimming pools, medical baths, saunas, swimming pool areas, chemical laboratories and other corrosive environments, where high humidity or airborne corrosion promoters, or both, are consistently present. This International Standard is not applicable to reflective glass for external glazing applications.
