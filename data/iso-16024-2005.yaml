    ISO 16024:2005 specifies design and performance requirements, test methods, user instructions, marking and labelling as appropriate, of flexible horizontal lifeline systems for use at any one time by up to three persons, exclusively for the attachment of personal protective equipment for protection against falls from a height. It does not stipulate designs for flexible horizontal lifelines, except for design limitations that are necessary for safe and durable service.
    ISO 16024:2005 does not cover rigid rail systems, nor is it intended to cover flexible guardrails, hand lines and work-positioning anchor lines.
