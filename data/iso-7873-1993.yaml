abstract:
- content: Specifies procedures for the statistical control of processes by using
    control charts based on calculating the arithmetic average of a sample and using
    warning limits and action limits. It is assumed that for large lots and for the
    mass output of piece and batch production, such a measure of quality is a random
    variable following a normal distribution. However, when averages of four or more
    items are plotted, this assumption of a normal distribution is not necessary for
    control purposes.
