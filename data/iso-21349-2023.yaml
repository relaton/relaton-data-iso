    This document specifies process requirements for project reviews as a set of required functions. It establishes requirements and recommendations on the function inputs, outputs, mechanisms and controlling conditions.
    This document specifies the responsibilities of a review board and gives guidance concerning review board composition.
    This document also provides descriptions of the kinds of reviews that are commonly useful in assuring the success of a space project.
    This document is applicable to status reviews for a project at any level within a larger project, as well as for major milestone reviews at the top level of a major project. It is intended to be used either by an independent developer as a basis for enterprise processes, or as a basis for an agreement between a supplier and a customer. It is intended for use in implementing the review requirements of ISO 14300-1, and ISO 14300-2, ISO 15865 and such other space systems and operations standards that require formal reviews.
