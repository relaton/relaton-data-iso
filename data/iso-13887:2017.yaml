    ISO 13887:2017 is applicable to all grades of cold-reduced steel sheet of higher yield strength with improved formability. The steel is made according to fine-grain practice and has a suitable chemical composition to provide improved formability. The product is intended for the fabrication of parts requiring better formability. It is generally used in the delivered condition.
    ISO 13887:2017 does not apply to steels designated as commercial quality or drawing quality (see ISO 3574), steels of structural quality (see ISO 4997) or steels of high tensile strength and low yield point with improved formability (see ISO 14590).
