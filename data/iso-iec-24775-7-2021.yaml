    The host-base storage portion of the Storage Management Technical Specification defines management profiles for autonomous, component and abstract profiles for management of host-based storage devices. The autonomous profiles describe the management of a stand-alone host-based storage entity. The component profiles describe management of aspects of host-based storage entities that may be used by other autonomous profiles. Finally, this section describes abstract profiles that may be used as a basis for creating additional Host-based autonomous profiles.This version of the Host-based Storage portion of the Storage Management Technical Specification includes autonomous profiles:
    - "The Host Discovered Resources ProfileThis profile defines the model for the storage devices presented to an operating system running on a hostcomputer system. In addition, this profile describes the map of storage associated to a host-computer systemthat a client application can discover.
    - "The Fibre Channel HBA ProfileThis profile defines the model and functions of a Fibre Channel HBA that exports block storage to a hostcomputer system from a SAN device (Fibre Channel switch, array, tape library, etc.).
    - iSCSI Initiator ProfileThis profile defines the model and functions necessary to manage an iSCSI initiator.Component profiles used by autonomous profiles to describe aspects of host-based storage elementsand services. The component profiles defined in this version of the specification include:
    - Host Hardware RAID Controller ProfileThis profile defines the model and functions of a host-based RAID controller that exports block storage to ahost computer system from locally attached storage devices (internal hard drives, JBODs, etc.)
    - Storage HBA ProfileThis profile defines the model and functions of a SAS, SATA, SPI, or Fibre Channel HBA that exports storageto a host computer system from a SAN device (Fibre Channel switch, array, tape library, etc.).
    - Disk Partition ProfileThe Disk Partition profile models partition (or slice) configuration services provided by operating systems onsome platforms.
    - SB Multipath Management ProfileThe SB Multipath Management Profile models paths (connections between host controllers and device ports)for environments supporting the SB (Single Byte) command protocol.
    - SCSI Multipath Management ProfileThe SCSI Multipath Management profile models paths (connections between host controllers, device ports,and logical units) for environments supporting the SCSI command protocol.
