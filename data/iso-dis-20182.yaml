    his International Standard describes the procedure for the preparation of test panels from refractory materials by gunning through pneumatic nozzle mixing type guns at ambient temperatures. The test pieces are for the determination of properties on as-gunned products prepared under either “standard conditions” (as required for quality assurance or product development) or “site conditions”. In the case of “site conditions”, the purpose of the testing is to establish the properties pertaining to a given installation or a given set of installation conditions. In this case, the panel is obtained during the on-site installation. Such parameters as ambient temperature, gunning elevation, air pressure and curing conditions (temperature, orientation of the panel) applying during the preparation of the panel are as near as possible to the same parameters pertaining to the site installation.
    This International Standard does not apply to plastic gunning mixes and might not apply to those mixes that contain aggregates that are susceptible to hydration.
    It also does not apply to shotcrete type mixes. (These are dealt with in ISO 18886, “Refractory test-piece preparation – Gunning refractory panels by wet gunning techniques.”).
