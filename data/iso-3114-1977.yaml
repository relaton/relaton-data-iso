abstract:
- content: Specifies a method of test for the determination of the extractability
    of certain stabilizers of unplasticized PVC in order to verify that the extracted
    quantities do not exceed a certain concentration. Tubular test pieces are prewashed
    during a fixed time. After this they are extracted with acidified (CO2) water
    in three steps and the quantity of the extracted stabilizers (lead salts or organic
    derivates to tin) shall be determined. The analytic methods are not specified.
