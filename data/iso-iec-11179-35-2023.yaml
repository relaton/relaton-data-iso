abstract:
- content: |-
    This document provides a specification for an extension to a Metadata Registry (MDR), as specified in ISO/IEC 11179-3, in which metadata that describes models, and their associated metamodels, can be registered.
    The specification in this document, together with the relevant clauses of the specification in ISO/IEC 11179-3, provides the ability to record metadata about:
    a)    models used in software engineering or information processing, for example, information or data models, process models, models of web services or any other type of models used to develop software systems or the processing of information;
    b)    the concepts associated with the various elements within the models;
    c)    the metamodels associated with the models;
    d)    the mappings identified between the models, between the metamodels, and between the models and their associated metamodels – this is achieved by using the mapping facilities specified in ISO/IEC 11179-3.
    This document is applicable to the formulation of models and metamodels to be shared among people and machines, independent of the organization that produces the model or metamodel. It is not applicable to the physical instantiation of any model.
