  content: "A number of image and video coding related standards include a requirement
    for decoders to implement an integer-output 8x8 inverse discrete cosine transform
    (IDCT) for the generation of inverse-transformed sample differences with a nominal
    range from -2B to (2B)-1 for some integer number of bits B, where B is greater
    than or equal to 8. ISO/IEC 23002-1:2006 specifies conformance requirements for
    establishing sufficient accuracy in such an integer-output IDCT implementation.
    It is intended to be suitable for reference to establish partial or complete requirements
    for IDCT accuracy for conformance to other standards that require IDCT use. \nThe
    accuracy requirements specified in the main body of ISO/IEC 23002-1:2006 are essentially
    the same as those previously specified in IEEE 1180-1990 (which has since been
    withdrawn), in Annex A of ITU-T Rec. H.261, and in Annex A of ITU-T Rec. H.263.
    These requirements have been specified herein to resolve normative references
    to IEEE 1180-1990 in MPEG standards after its withdrawal and to provide improved
    clarity for the specification of IDCT accuracy requirements. \nAn additional requirement
    on encoded-bitstream intra refresh frequency was also previously specified in
    IEEE 1180-1990, establishing a requirement of bitstream conformance that each
    macroblock be intra-coded at least once within each series of 132 times that it
    is coded in a predicted picture without an intervening intra picture. That additional
    requirement is not specified in ISO/IEC 23002-1:2006 , in order to confine its
    scope to the domain of decoder conformance specification. \nSome allowances for
    modification of the specified accuracy requirements are made within ISO/IEC 23002-1:2006.
    Additional accuracy requirements that may be invoked by a referencing specification
    are specified in Annexes A and B. "
