abstract:
- content: Concerns the stability of a moped as an important element of the active
    safety. The determination of the kinetic characteristics of the moped/rider combination
    is to be considered an important part of the design parameters of the vehicle
    itself. The test procedure described in ISO 8705 deals with one aspect of the
    kinetic characteristics (the determination of the centre of gravity). Other measuring
    methods can be used if it is demonstrated that their results are equivalent. Annex
    A gives a format for measurement results.
