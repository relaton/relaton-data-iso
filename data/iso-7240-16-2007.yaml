  content: "ISO 7240-16:2007 specifies the requirements, test methods and performance
    criteria for sound system control and indicating equipment (s.s.c.i.e.) for use
    in buildings and structures as part of a sound system for emergency purposes (s.s.e.p.)
    aas defined in ISO 7240-1. The s.s.c.i.e. is primarily intended to broadcast information
    for the protection of lives within one or more specified areas in an emergency,
    to effect a rapid and orderly mobilization of occupants in an indoor or outdoor
    area. This includes systems using loudspeakers to broadcast voice announcements
    for emergency purposes, alert signals complying with ISO 7731, and evacuate signals
    complying with ISO 8201. \nThe overall requirements of an s.s.e.p., especially
    concerning audibility and intelligibility, are contained within ISO 7240-19. In
    addition to ensuring compliance with ISO 7240-16:2007, the manufacturer should
    also consider the requirements of ISO 7240-19, national regulations, codes and
    standards that affect the s.s.c.i.e. design and usability. For example, some regulations
    require certain optional functions to be available on all s.s.c.i.e. installed
    within the jurisdiction.\nThe use of the equipment for normal sound reinforcement
    and distribution systems purposes under non-hazardous circumstances is not excluded.\nISO
    7240-16:2007 can also be used for the assessment of similar control and indicating
    equipment for use in systems where the warning-signal broadcast does not include
    a voice message.\nISO 7240-16:2007 does not apply to systems using only sounders
    or bells."
