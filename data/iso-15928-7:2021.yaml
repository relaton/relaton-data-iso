    This document sets out a method for describing the performance of houses. It covers user needs, provides performance descriptions, and outlines evaluation processes. It includes the description of relevant parameters necessary to ensure accessibility and usability in houses. It also includes features to ensure safety during daily use, i.e., reasonable consideration to prevent accident like tripping, falls, or collision.
    This document is intended for use in the evaluation of the design and construction of houses, in the international trading of houses or their sub-systems, and in developing risk-management tools for the protection of houses. It does not specify a level of performance and it is not intended to provide design method and/or criteria.
    NOTE 1    Structural safety, fire safety, and other performance attributes of a house are covered in other parts of the ISO 15928 series.
    NOTE 2    Exporting a house (as a complete set, “kit house” for example) does mean that the site is not necessarily predetermined. Therefore, surrounding conditions cannot be known in advance. Even the interface between the entrance door and the ground cannot be predetermined (including how flat entry can be achieved). It is up to the builder and the client to decide how to design the interface. However, design examples for accessibility can be given.
    NOTE 3    The way to describe performance of buildings is given in ISO 19208.
