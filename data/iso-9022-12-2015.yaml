  content: "ISO 9022-12:2015 specifies the methods relating to the environmental tests
    of optical instruments including additional assemblies from other fields (e.g.
    mechanical, chemical, and electronic devices), under equivalent conditions, for
    their ability to resist the influence of contamination, i.e. contact with corrosive
    chemical substances (hereafter called test agents). \nHowever, complete instruments
    or assemblies are only tested as specified in ISO 9022-12:2015 in exceptional
    cases. Normally, representative samples such as material items or surface coatings
    on representative substrates are used for testing.\nThe tests described in ISO
    9022-12:2015 are designed for the selection of materials and components for instruments
    likely to suffer contamination during service life, rather than for regular production
    control.\nThe purpose of testing is to investigate the resistance of an instrument
    and, in particular, of instrument surfaces, coatings, or synthetic materials,
    to a short exposure to the test agents."
