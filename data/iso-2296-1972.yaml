  content: Specifies the mechanical characteristics. It concerns saws with fine teeth
    (see table 1) and with coarse teeth (see table 2). The ratio between the number
    of teeth saws with coarse teeth and the number of teeth for saws with fine teeth
    is 0,5, and specific values have been related to saws diameters and thicknesses.
    If there is a need to extend the range or introduce other series of teeth,such
    additions should be in accordance with data given in the annex.
