- content: |-
    This document specifies the test methods, test conditions, test target design, and analysis procedures for the evaluation of the image permanence performance of photographic reflection prints. Tests based on ISO 18936, ISO 18937 (all parts), ISO 18941, and ISO 18946 characterize the thermal stability, the light stability, the ozone stability, and the humidity stability of photographic prints, respectively.
    This document is applicable to any photographic reflection print produced through a digital step in the workflow. It includes prints created by chromogenic silver halide, inkjet, electrophotography, thermal diffusion, and other technologies. With reference to monochrome prints, this document is relevant to photographic prints where the print material contains colorants. This document is not relevant to monochrome silver halide prints, often known as black and white prints.
    The document specifies the content and procedure for graphical reporting of test results as a first level data collection for basic technical communication of image permanence performance of photographic prints.
    This document does not include application-specific end-points, environmental conditions during preservation and display of photographic prints, and test doses (durations, intensity).
