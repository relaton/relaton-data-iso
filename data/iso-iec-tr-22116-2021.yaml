    This document introduces the effects of population demographics on biometric functions. It:
    —    establishes terms and definitions relevant to the study of demographic factors in biometric recognition system performance;
    —    identifies areas where biometric systems can exhibit different performances based on different demographic factors of the individuals submitting the biometric samples;
    —    explains how different demographic factors can influence the biometric characteristics captured by different biometric modalities and how these influences can affect biometric performance measures;
    —    presents a case study on existing scientific material that explores the impact of demographic factors on biometric system performance. Only biometric modalities where quantitative information is available on the impact of demographic factors are considered.
    Outside of the scope of this document are:
    —    effects of disease and injury on biometric performance; and
    —    how religious and cultural norms can affect biometric operations.
