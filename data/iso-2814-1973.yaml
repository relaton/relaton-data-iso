  content: Specifies the standard method to be used in comparing the contrast ratios
    given by paint films of white or ligth colours, of refelctance factor greater
    than 40 %, dried at normal air temperature and applied at approximately equal
    wet film thickness to black and white substrates. The wet film thickness selected,
    approximately 50 um, corresponds to a spreading rate of approximately 20 m2/l.
    Because different operators using the same film coating device obtain films differing
    in thickness the method is not satisfactory as an absolute method for the determination
    of hiding power.
