    This document specifies requirements for classification of wire electrodes, wires, rods and all-weld metal deposits in the as-welded condition and in the post-weld heat-treated (PWHT) condition for gas shielded metal arc welding and tungsten inert-gas welding of high-strength steels with a minimum yield strength greater than 500 MPa, or a minimum tensile strength greater than 570 MPa. One wire electrode can be tested and classified with different shielding gases.
    This document is a combined specification providing for classification utilizing a system based upon the yield strength and the average impact energy of 47 J of all-weld metal, or utilizing a system based upon the tensile strength and the average impact energy of 27 J of all-weld metal.
    a)       Clauses, subclauses and tables which carry the suffix “System A” are applicable only to wire electrodes, wires, rods and deposits classified according to the system based upon the yield strength and the average impact energy of 47 J of all-weld metal under this document.
    b)       Clauses, subclauses and tables which carry the suffix “System B” are applicable only to wire electrodes, wires, rods and deposits classified according to the system based upon the tensile strength and the average impact energy of 27 J of all-weld metal under this document.
    c)        Clauses, subclauses and tables which do not have either the suffix “System A” or “System B” are applicable to all wire electrodes, wires, rods and deposits classified under this document.
    Annex A gives information on the description of composition designations for electrodes in the classification system based upon tensile strength and average impact energy of 27 J – System B.
