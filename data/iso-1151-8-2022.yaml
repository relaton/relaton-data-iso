    This document defines terms related to the concepts and quantities characterizing some classes of aircraft motion and their fundamental dynamic characteristics.
    The aircraft is assumed to be rigid, of constant mass and of constant inertia. It is not equipped with systems modifying its natural dynamic behaviour. However, most of the definitions can be applied to the case of a flexible aircraft, of variable mass and of variable inertia.
    The general concepts defined in this document are applicable to the atmospheric flight phase.
