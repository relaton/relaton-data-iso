    ISO 12021:2011 specifies an open-loop test method to determine the sensitivity to lateral wind of a vehicle by means of a wind generator. It applies to passenger cars as defined in ISO 3833, passenger car-trailer combinations and light trucks. Its applicability to motorcycles is yet to be investigated.
    The test conditions specified in this test method are not representative of real driving conditions but are useful to obtain measures of vehicle dynamic response to lateral wind.
