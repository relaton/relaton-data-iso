  content: "This standard establishes requirements for biometric recognition systems
    that could become subject to morphing attacks.\n\nThe standard establishes:\n•\tTaxonomy
    of biometric sample modifications and manipulation with a specific focus on manipulations
    that constitute a multiple identity attack. This can be for instance an enrolment
    attack with face image morphing.\n•\tRequirements for testing databases that contain
    bona fide (i.e. pristine) and morphed images. \n•\tMethodology to measure the
    attack potential of a morphing method constituted with a dataset of morphed images.
    \n\nBased on the methodology the user of the standard can simulate a real use
    case (for example issuance of documents or border control) with a variable number
    of attempts (i.e., multiple probe images acquired at the gate) and multiple biometric
    recognition systems (i.e., to simulate ABC gates from different vendors), in order
    to determine the attack potential against biometric recognition systems.\n\nThe
    standard includes informative content on how morphing algorithms can be used for
    system evaluation. \n\nThe standard is intended to support evaluations of biometric
    recognition systems with respect to multiple identity attack."
