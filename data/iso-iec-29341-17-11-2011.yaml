  content: "ISO/IEC 29341-17-11:2011(E) describes the service-type that enables modelling
    of 'Quality of Service Manager' function capabilities. This service provides a
    mechanism for a Control Point to:    \n- Be agnostic of the QoS capabilities and
    associated details about the various QoS Devices on the network at the expense
    of potential network inefficiency.                                         \n-
    Abstract the tasks of setting up, modifying and revoking the QoS associated with
    every traffic stream.                         \n- QosManager:3 defines new capabilities
    to set up Parameterized QoS. Control Points may now request reservations for specific
    resources for the exclusive use of individual streams. Successful resource reservation
    ensures that streams will always have the bandwidth and other resources to transport
    time critical data.             \n- QosManager:3 defines a method for Control
    Points to request preemption of existing reservations on the UPnP-QoS network
    if necessary to admit a new stream.                              \n- QosManager:3
    supports a mechanism for providing a list of blocking streams to a Control Point
    so that it can handle preemption on its own, if desired. This service definition
    is compliant with the UPnP Device Architecture version 1.0."
