    This document specifies the safety requirements for rock drill rigs and rock reinforcement rigs designed for the following underground or surface operations:
    a) blast hole drilling;
    b) rock reinforcement;
    c) drilling for secondary breaking;
    d) dimensional stone drilling;
    e) mineral prospecting, e.g. utilizing core drilling or reverse circulation;
    f) water and methane drainage drilling;
    g) raise boring.
    NOTE Rigs can be designed for more than one of the operations above. See ISO 18758-1 for vocabulary.
    This document is also applicable to earth-moving machinery as defined in ISO 6165, modified to become a rock drill rig or rock reinforcement rig.
    This document is not applicable to the following machines: drill rigs for soil and rock mixture; (geothermal drill rigs, water well drill rigs, water jet drill rigs, micro pile drill rigs; surface horizontal directional drill rigs (HDD) as defined in ISO 21467), kelly drill rigs (and casing drivers); cable tool drill rigs; pre-armouring machines; sonic drill rigs; shaft sinking drill rigs; crane attached drill rigs; drill rigs on derricks; scaling machines.
    This document deals with the significant hazards, hazardous situations or hazardous events, as listed in Annex E, relevant to rock drill rigs and rock reinforcement rigs (see ISO 18758‑1), when they are used as intended and under the conditions of misuse which are reasonably foreseeable by the manufacturer.
    This document is not applicable to rigs manufactured before the date of its publication.
