    This document specifies the thermophysical properties of several commonly used refrigerants and refrigerant blends.
    This document is applicable to refrigerants R12, R22, R32, R123, R125, R134a, R143a, R152a, R290, R600a, R717 (ammonia), R744 (carbon dioxide), R1233zd(E), R1336mzz(Z), R1234yf and R1234ze(E) and to the refrigerant blends R404A, R407C, R410A, and R507A. The following properties are included: density, pressure, internal energy, enthalpy, entropy, heat capacity at constant pressure, heat capacity at constant volume, speed of sound, and the Joule-Thomson coefficient, in both single-phase states and along the liquid-vapour saturation boundary. The numerical designation of these refrigerants is that defined in ISO 817.
    NOTE 1    R12, R22, R123 are controlled substances under the Montreal Protocol, Annex A (R12) or Annex C Group I (R22, R123).
    NOTE 2    R32, R125, R134a, R143a, R152a, R404A, R407C, R410A, and R507A are controlled substances under the Montreal Protocol, Annex F or blend thereof.
