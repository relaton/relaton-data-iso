    This document specifies the determination of composition of triacylglycerols and the determination of the composition and content of diacylglycerols by capillary gas chromatography in vegetable oils with a lauric acid content below 1 %.
    Applying certain technological processing 1,2-diacylglycerols (1,2-DAGs) are transformed to the more stable isomeric 1,3-diacylglycerols (1,3-DAGs) due to acidic catalysed reaction. During storage, the speed and amount of this rearrangement depends on the acidity of the oil. The transformation normally reaches an equilibrium between the two isomeric forms. The relative amount of 1,2-DAGs is related to oil freshness or to a possible technological treatment. Therefore, it is possible to use the ratio of 1,2-DAGs to 1,3-DAGs as a quality criterion for vegetable fats and oils.
    The triacylglycerols profile is of potential interest for the fingerprint of each vegetable oil and may help the detection of certain types of adulteration, such as the addition of high oleic sunflower oil or palm olein in olive oil.
    NOTE       This document is based on Reference [3].
