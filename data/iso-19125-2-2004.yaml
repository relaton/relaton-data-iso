    This part of ISO 19125:2004 specifies an SQL schema that supports storage, retrieval, query and update of simple geospatial feature collections via the SQL Call Level Interface (SQL/CLI) and establishes an architecture for the implementation of feature tables.
    This part of ISO 19125:2004 defines terms to use within the architecture. of geographic information and defines a simple feature profile of ISO 19107. In addition, this part of ISO 19125:2004 describes a set of SQL Geometry Types together with SQL functions on those types. The Geometry Types and Functions described represent a profile of ISO 13249-3.
    This part of ISO 19125:2004 standardizes the names and geometric definitions of the SQL Types for Geometry and the names, signatures and geometric definitions of the SQL Functions for Geometry.
    This part of ISO 19125:2004 does not attempt to standardize and does not depend upon any part of the mechanism by which Types are added and maintained in the SQL environment, including the following:
    - the syntax and functionality provided for defining types;
    - the syntax and functionality provided for defining SQL functions;
    - the physical storage of type instances in the database;
    - specific terminology used to refer to User Defined Types, for example, UDT.
