    This document specifies an abrasion test method for accelerated testing of artificial turfs for use in sports facilities.
    Combined exposure to simulated solar UV radiation and mechanical wear in simultaneous or sequential modes is the method used. The details of radiation, temperature, and moisture exposure, as well as to mechanical abrasion using soccer shoe studs on rotating drum assembly, are given in this document.
    NOTE      It was determined that simultaneous exposure was more effective than sequential exposure.
