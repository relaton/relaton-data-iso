  content: 'Deals with the concepts and quantities characterizing models of the air
    motions affecting the dynamic behaviour of the aircraft. The motion of the air
    with respect to the Earth is defined by the wind velocity in each point of the
    aircraft trajectory. In flight dynamic problems, it is usual to use mathematical
    models of the wind velocity field and its variation with time. The following models
    are defined: constant wind, wind gradients, discrete gusts, three-dimensional
    wind models, vortices. Other models can be defined by superposition of these models.'
