    ISO 18752:2006 specifies requirements for nine classes, four grades and seven types of wire- or textile-reinforced hydraulic hoses and hose assemblies of nominal sizes ranging from 5 to 102. Each class has a single maximum working pressure for all sizes. Such hoses are suitable for use with hydraulic fluids HH, HL, HM, HR and HV as defined in ISO 6743-4 at temperatures ranging from -40 °C to +100 °C for two of the grades and and -40 °C to +120 °C for the other two grades.
    This International Standard does not include requirements for the connection ends. It is limited to the performance of hoses and hose assemblies. The hose assembly maximum working pressure is governed by the lowest maximum working pressure of the components.
