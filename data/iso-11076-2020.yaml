    This document establishes the minimum requirements for deicing/anti-icing methods on the ground of main line and regional airplanes, in accordance with ICAO, Document 9640-AN/9401) and the relevant civil aviation requirements, to facilitate the safe operation of main line and regional civil transport airplanes during icing conditions. This document does not specify requirements for specific aircraft model types.
    Airlines' published manuals, procedures or methods supplement the information contained in this document.
    Frost, ice or snow deposits, which can seriously affect the aerodynamic performance and/or controllability of an aircraft, are effectively removed by the application of the procedures specified in this document.
    It is the airplane operator's responsibility to consult airplane manufacturer's aircraft operations manual, aircraft maintenance manual and service letters to determine any limitations/restrictions relating to the use of deicing/anti-icing methods meeting this document for the type and model of airplane to be treated.
