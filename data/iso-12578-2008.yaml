    ISO 12578:2008 specifies requirements for the components of glued laminated timber members and minimum requirements for the production of such members for structural use.
    ISO 12578:2008 is applicable to products with a finished lamination thickness of not more than 50 mm.
    Although most glued laminated timber is made from coniferous species, ISO 12578:2008 also applies to broad-leaf species if the tests specified in ISO 12578:2008 show that a satisfactory glue bond can be achieved.
    The basic requirements apply to structural members of all service classes; however, special precautions are necessary for service class 3, for example, the use of weather-resistant adhesives.
    ISO 12578:2008 does not apply to the determination of strength and stiffness characteristics.
