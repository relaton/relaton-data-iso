  content: "Abstract:\nIn recent years, there has been an increase in the availability
    and interest in using biometric sensors for authenticating users, but the potential
    for attacks on a system through the biometric sensor has limited the use of biometrics
    in applications which are unsupervised by an agent of the system owner, such as
    remote authentication over untrusted networks.  Biometric data can be easily obtained
    directly from a person, online, or through existing databases and then used to
    create spoofs (or fakes) to mount an attack. The presentation of a biometric spoof
    (e.g. a facial image or video of a person on a tablet or a fake silicone or gelatin
    fingerprint) to a biometric sensor can be detected by methods broadly referred
    to as presentation attack detection, PAD. \nThe purpose of ISO/IEC 30107-1 is
    to provide a foundation for PAD through defining terms and establishing a framework
    through which presentation attack events can be specified and detected so that
    they can be categorized, detailed and communicated for subsequent decision making
    and performance assessment activities. This foundation is intended to not only
    introduce and frame the topics of presentation attacks and PAD but also to benefit
    other standards projects. This standard does not advocate a specific standard
    PAD method.  The scope is limited to describing attacks that take place at the
    sensor during the presentation and collection of biometric characteristics.\nThere
    are two other parts of ISO/IEC 30107, under the general title Information Technology
    - Biometric presentation attack detection:\n- Part 2:Data Formats\n- Part 3: Testing
    and reporting.\nKeywords:\nLiveness, liveness detection, biometric liveness detection,
    spoof detection, biometric spoof, biometric spoof detection, fake, fake biometric,
    fake biometrics, arefact, artefact detection.\n."
