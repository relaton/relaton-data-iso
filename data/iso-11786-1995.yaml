abstract:
- content: Specifies an electrical connector and its pin layout for mounting on an
    agricultural tractor with a nominal 12-volt battery supply for the purpose of
    providing an interface between tractor-mounted sensors and equipment requiring
    signals from those sensors. Provides therefore a short-term solution to date communication
    between a restricted set of tractor-mounted sensors and other systems on agricultural
    tractors and attached machinery, in anticipation of the availability of a standardized
    digital data bus system.
