  content: Applies to tanks with cylindrical courses that are substantially vertical.
    Provides a method suitable for use as a working method, a reference method or
    a referee method for measuring a tank using a steel strapping tape. The operation
    of strapping, the corrections to be made and the calculations leading to the compilation
    of the tank capacity table are described. For tilted tanks with a deviation of
    up to 3 % from the vertical a correction may be applied that is described.
