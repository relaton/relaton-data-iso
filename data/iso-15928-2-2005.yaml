    ISO 15928-2:2005 sets out a method for describing the structural
    serviceability performance of houses. ISO 1592-2:2005 covers user needs,
    provides performance descriptions, establishes parameter descriptions and
    outlines evaluation processes.
    ISO 15928-2:22005 is intended for use in the evaluation of the design and
    construction of houses, in the international trading of houses or their
    sub-systems, and in developing quality systems for houses.
    ISO 15928-2:2005 does not apply to structural safety, durability or other
    attributes that are covered in other parts of ISO 15928.
