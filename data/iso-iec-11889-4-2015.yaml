  content: "ISO/IEC 11889-4:2015 contains C code that describes the algorithms and
    methods used by the command code in ISO/IEC 11889-3. The code in ISO/IEC 11889-4:2015
    augments ISO/IEC 11889-2 and ISO/IEC 11889-3 to provide a complete description
    of a TPM, including the supporting framework for the code that performs the command
    actions. \nAny code in ISO/IEC 11889-4:2015 may be replaced by code that provides
    similar results when interfacing to the action code in ISO/IEC 11889-3. The behavior
    of code in this ISO/IEC 11889-4:2015 that is not included in an annex is normative,
    as observed at the interfaces with ISO/IEC 11889-3 code. Code in an annex is provided
    for completeness, that is, to allow a full implementation of ISO/IEC 11889 from
    the provided code.\nThe code in ISO/IEC 11889-3 and this ISO/IEC 11889-4:2015
    is written to define the behavior of a compliant TPM. In some cases (e.g., firmware
    update), it is not possible to provide a compliant implementation. In those cases,
    any implementation provided by the vendor that meets the general description of
    the function provided in ISO/IEC 11889-3 would be compliant.\nThe code in ISO/IEC
    11889-3 and this ISO/IEC 11889-4:2015 is not written to meet any particular level
    of conformance nor does ISO/IEC 11889 require that a TPM meet any particular level
    of conformance."
