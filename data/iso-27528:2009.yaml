    ISO 27528:2009 specifies a method for determining the resistance of wood-based panels, of thickness 15 mm and greater, to the withdrawal of screws under axial load.
    NOTE          ISO 27528:2009 establishes fastener holding performance of screws commonly used in applications involving wood-based panels used for building, furniture, cabinet making, joinery or other work in particular regions. Different screws will give different results.
