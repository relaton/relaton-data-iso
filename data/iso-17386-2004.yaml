abstract:
- content: "ISO 17386:2004 for Manoeuvring Aids for Low Speed Operation addresses
    light-duty vehicles, e.g. passenger cars, pick-up trucks, light vans and sport
    utility vehicles (motorcycles excluded) equipped with such MALSO systems. It specifies
    minimum functionality requirements which the driver can generally expect of the
    device; i.e., detection of and information on the presence of relevant obstacles
    within a defined (short) detection range. It defines minimum requirements for
    failure indication as well as performance test procedures; it includes rules for
    the general information strategy but does not restrict the kind of information
    or display system.\nMALSO systems use object-detection devices (sensors) for ranging
    in order to provide the driver with information based on the distance to obstacles.
    The sensing technology is not addressed. The current test objects are defined
    based on systems using ultrasonic sensors, which reflect the most commonly used
    available technology. \nVisibility-enhancement systems like video-camera aids
    without distance ranging and warning and reversing aids and obstacle-detection
    devices on heavy commercial vehicles are not covered by ISO 17386:2004."
