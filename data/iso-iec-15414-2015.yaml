  content: "ISO/IEC 15414:2015 provides:\na)    a language (the enterprise language)
    comprising concepts, structures, and rules for developing, representing and reasoning
    about a specification of an ODP system from the enterprise viewpoint (as defined
    in Rec. ITU-T X.903 | ISO/IEC 10746-3); \nb)    rules which establish correspondences
    between the enterprise language and the other viewpoint languages (defined in
    Rec. ITU-T X.903 | ISO/IEC 10746-3) to ensure the overall consistency of a specification.\nThe
    language is specified to a level of detail sufficient to enable the determination
    of the compliance of any modelling language to this Recommendation | International
    Standard and to establish requirements for new specification techniques.\nISO/IEC
    15414:2015 is intended for use in preparing enterprise viewpoint specifications
    of ODP systems, and in developing notations and tools to support such specifications.\nAs
    specified in clause 5 of Rec. ITU-T X.903 | ISO/IEC 10746‑3, an enterprise viewpoint
    specification defines the purpose, scope and policies of an ODP system.\nISO/IEC
    15414:2015 is a refinement and extension of Rec. ITU‑T X.903 | ISO/IEC 10746‑3,
    clauses 5 and 10, but does not replace them."
