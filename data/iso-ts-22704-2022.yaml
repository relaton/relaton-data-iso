    This document specifies methods for determining the uncertainty of the measurement and evaluation of human exposure to vibration. It applies to measurements of vibration quantities (measurands), calculated following a relevant measurement model on the basis of directly measured values, to evaluate
    a) human exposure to hand-transmitted vibration at the workplace,
    b) vibration emission of hand-held and hand-guided machinery in a laboratory setting,
    c) human exposure to whole-body vibration at the workplace, and
    d) whole-body vibration emission of vehicles.
    Examples of the application of the individual methods in practical situations are provided in the annexes.
    In this document a measurement error is defined as the difference between a measured and a reference quantity value.
    In this document “uncertainty” does not include errors that result from bad measurement strategies, faulty use of measurement equipment or other mistakes.
