abstract:
- content: Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) is a well-established technique that
    allows structural information to be obtained about inhomogeneities in materials
    with a characteristic length from 1 nm to 100 nm. Under certain conditions (narrow
    size distributions, appropriate instrumental configuration, and idealised shape)
    the limit of 100 nm can be significantly extended. ISO 17687:2015 specifies a
    method for the application of SAXS to the estimation of mean particle sizes in
    dilute dispersions where the interaction between the particles is negligible.
    This International Standard allows two complementary data evaluation methods to
    be performed, model fitting and Guinier approximation. The most appropriate evaluation
    method shall be selected by the analyst and stated clearly in the report. SAXS
    is sensitive to electron density fluctuations. Therefore, particles in solution
    and pores in a matrix can be studied in same way.
