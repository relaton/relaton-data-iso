abstract:
- content: "ISO 26262 is intended to be applied to safety-related systems that include
    one or more electrical and/or electronic (E/E) systems and that are installed
    in series production passenger cars with a maximum gross vehicle mass up to 3
    500 kg. ISO 26262 does not address unique E/E systems in special purpose vehicles
    such as vehicles designed for drivers with disabilities. \nSystems and their components
    released for production, or systems and their components already under development
    prior to the publication date of ISO 26262, are exempted from the scope. For further
    development or alterations based on systems and their components released for
    production prior to the publication of ISO 26262, only the modifications will
    be developed in accordance with ISO 26262.\nISO 26262 addresses possible hazards
    caused by malfunctioning behaviour of E/E safety-related systems, including interaction
    of these systems. It does not address hazards related to electric shock, fire,
    smoke, heat, radiation, toxicity, flammability, reactivity, corrosion, release
    of energy and similar hazards, unless directly caused by malfunctioning behaviour
    of E/E safety-related systems.\nISO 26262 does not address the nominal performance
    of E/E systems, even if dedicated functional performance standards exist for these
    systems (e.g. active and passive safety systems, brake systems, Adaptive Cruise
    Control).\nISO 26262-8:2011 specifies the requirements for supporting processes,
    including the following:\n-        interfaces within distributed developments,\n-
    \       overall management of safety requirements,\n-        configuration management,\n-
    \       change management,\n-        verification,\n-        documentation,\n-
    \       confidence in the use of software tools,\n-        qualification of software
    components,\n-        qualification of hardware components, and\n-        proven
    in use argument."
