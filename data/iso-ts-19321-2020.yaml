abstract:
- content: |-
    This document specifies the in-vehicle information (IVI) data structures that are required by different intelligent transport system (ITS) services for exchanging information between ITS Stations (ITS-S). A general, extensible data structure is specified, which is split into structures called containers to accommodate current-day information. Transmitted information includes IVI such as contextual speed, road works warnings, vehicle restrictions, lane restrictions, road hazard warnings, location-based services, re-routing. The information in the containers is organized in sub-structures called data frames and data elements, which are described in terms of its content and its syntax.
    The data structures are specified as communications agnostic. This document does not provide the communication protocols. This document provides scenarios for usage of the data structure, e.g. in case of real time, short-range communications.
