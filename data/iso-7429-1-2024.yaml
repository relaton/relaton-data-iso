    This document specifies the evaluation methods for size and concentration indices of fine bubbles (FBs) generated through a nozzle. It only applies to FB dispersions (FBDs) in water generated through the nozzle. It describes the sampling method for a FBD from the nozzle into the retention container and the measurements of size and concentration indices.
    Major applications of the equipment include components of various industrial water systems and consumer baths and kitchens.
