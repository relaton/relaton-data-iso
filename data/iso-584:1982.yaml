abstract:
- content: Specifies a method for the determination of the reactivity of unsaturated
    polyester resins as characterized by the maximum temperature reached when heated
    with catalyst in a water-bath at 80 °C and by the time taken for the temperatur
    of the mixture to rise from 65 °C to this maximum temperature. As the test results
    depend very much on the conditions under which the test is carried out, these
    conditions are described in detail.
