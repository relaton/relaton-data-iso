    This document specifies a mapping of SysML (ISO/IEC 19514:2017) constructs to EXPRESS (ISO 10303-11:2004) elements for the purpose of representing SysML model represented in XMI (ISO/IEC 19509:2014) as EXPRESS (ISO 10303-11:2004) schemas. The specified mapping is a one-way transformation from SysML information model represented in XMI into an EXPRESS schema.
    NOTE       Due to this limitation 10303-16 does not define the transformation of arbitrary SysML models to EXPRESS.
    The following are within the scope of this document:
    —    the transformation of SysML metamodel constructs represented in XMI to EXPRESS elements for the purpose of representing SysML information models as EXPRESS schemas.
    The following are outside the scope of this document:
    —    the transformation of SysML metamodel constructs into EXPRESS elements that are not used in the STEP Extended Architecture.
    NOTE       The STEP Extended Architecture is defined in References [8], [9] and [10].
    —    the transformation of SysML metamodel constructs into EXPRESS elements for other purposes than representing SysML constructs as STEP concepts;
    —    codes and scripts to transform SysML XMI to EXPRESS schema;
    —    the transformation of SysML constraints (OCL[5]) into EXPRESS global and local rules;
    —    the transformation of EXPRESS elements into SysML constructs.
