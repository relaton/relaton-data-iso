    ISO 9924-1:2016 specifies a thermogravimetric method for the determination of the total organic content, carbon black content and ash in vulcanizates and uncured compounds. The loss in mass at 300 °C is an approximate guide to the volatile-matter content of the compound.
    The method is suitable for the analysis of rubber compounds and vulcanizates containing the following rubbers occurring alone or as mixtures:
    a) polyisoprene of natural or synthetic origin;
    b) polybutadiene;
    c) styrene-butadiene copolymers;
    d) isobutylene-isoprene copolymers;
    e) ethylene-propylene copolymers and related terpolymers.
    NOTE The field of application of the method may be extended to the analysis of compounds containing rubbers different from those given in this subclause, provided that the applicability of the method is tested beforehand using known compounds or vulcanizates having a similar composition. Other compounds are covered in ISO 9924‑2.
    The method is not suitable for rubbers containing polymers which form a carbonaceous residue during pyrolysis, such as many chlorine- or nitrogen-containing rubbers.
    The method is also not suitable for materials containing additives which cause the formation of carbonaceous residues during pyrolysis, such as cobalt and lead salts or phenolic resins.
    The method is not suitable for compounds containing mineral fillers, such as carbonates or hydrated aluminium oxides, which decompose in the temperature range from 25 °C to 650 °C, unless suitable corrections based on prior knowledge of filler behaviour can be made.
    The method is not suitable for the determination of the total polymer content of compounds or vulcanizates containing non-rubber organic ingredients that cannot be completely removed by solvent extraction carried out in accordance with ISO 1407.
