    This document establishes the requirements for simulation of the space control system, including the objective, architecture and procedure, etc. This document is applicable to four phases of control system development, including conceptual design, detailed design, prototype and integrated system.
    The control system referred to in this document is the flight control system for guidance, navigation and control (GNC) of space systems which include launch vehicle, satellite and spaceship, etc. This document establishes a minimum set of requirements for simulation of the flight control system, and provides guidance to engineers on what to simulate in each phase of control system development. The requirements are generic in nature because of their broad applicability to all types of simulations. Implementation details of the requirements are addressed in project-specific standards, requirements, and handbooks, etc.
