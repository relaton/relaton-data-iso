  script: Latn
  content: "ISO/IEC 29341-26-1:2017 describes an architecture that allows UPnP Telephony
    devices, services and control points defined in the propoded DCP to be deployed
    in the home network environment and to enable management of incoming and outgoing
    telephony calls, messaging, presence information and phone features configuration
    through UPnP means from devices within the home. \nIn order to accommodate the
    above mentioned goals, the Telephony Architecture defines several UPnP devices
    and services that can be embedded to the devices defined for telephony. The architecture
    model describes interaction among the telephony devices, services and control
    points. The architecture also describes various deployment scenarios. \nThe architecture
    does not describe any interfaces to \"service\" gateways that will enable non-UPnP
    entities to interact with the UPnP devices, services and control points physically
    attached to the home network."
