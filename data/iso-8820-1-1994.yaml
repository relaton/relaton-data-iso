abstract:
- content: Establishes the rated current, identification, test procedures and performance
    requirements for blade-type electric fuse-links with rated currents up to and
    including 30 A, used to protect on-board wiring harnesses and electrical equipment,
    with a rated voltage up to and including 32 V, of road vehicles and similar applications
    from overcurrent. Interruption of the circuit is achieved as a result of the fuse
    element melting. Dimensions for blade-type electric fuse-links are specified in
    ISO 8820-2, and the test fixture in ISO 8820-3.
