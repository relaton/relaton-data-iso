    This document specifies the method for the determination of fat content.
    The method is applicable to:
    a)    raw milk (cow, sheep, goat), reduced fat milk, skimmed milk, chemically preserved milk and processed liquid milk;
    b)    dried milk products (e.g. whole, partially skimmed, skimmed milk powder; dairy permeate powder; whey powder; blend skimmed milk powder and vegetable fat; milk based infant formula powder);
    c)    raw, processed and sour cream.
    For the following products, the precision figures are given in Annex H. These precision figures are derived from interlaboratory studies not conforming to the requirements from ISO 5725-2 in terms of number of samples (< 6) and number of participating laboratories (< 8).
    d)    evaporated milk and sweetened condensed milk (e.g. liquid sweetened and unsweetened concentrated milk);
    e)    whey cheese as defined in CODEX CXS 284‑1999;
    f)     liquid whey and buttermilk;
    g)    milk-based edible ices and ice mixes;
    h)    liquid concentrated infant foods.
    The method does not apply in the following cases:
    —    For b), when the powder contains hard lumps which do not dissolve in ammonia solution. This is noticeable by a distinct smell and the result of the determination will be too low. In such cases, a method using the Weibull-Berntrop principle is suitable, e.g. ISO 8262-3|IDF 124-3.
    —    For c), The method is not applicable to sour creams with starch or other thickening agents. When separation or breakdown of fat occurs, a method using the Weibull-Berntrop principle is suitable, e.g. ISO 8262-3|IDF 124-3.
    —    For e), to products which do not dissolve completely in ammonia solution, as the result of the determination will be too low. With such products, a method using the Weibull-Berntrop principle is suitable, e.g. ISO 8262-3|IDF 124-3.
    —    For g), to milk-based edible ices and ice mixes in which the level of emulsifier, stabilizer or thickening agent or of egg yolk or of fruits, or of combinations of these constituents, makes the Röse-Gottlieb method unsuitable. With such products, a method using the Weibull-Berntrop principle is suitable, e.g. ISO 8262-2|IDF 124-2.
    —    For h), to products which do not dissolve completely in ammonia due to the presence of starch or dextrin at mass fractions of more than 5 % (in dry matter), or to the presence of hard lumps. For such products, a method using the Weibull-Berntrop principle is suitable, e.g. ISO 8262-1|IDF 124-1.
