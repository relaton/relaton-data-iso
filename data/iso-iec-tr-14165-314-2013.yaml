abstract:
- content: |-
    ISO/IEC 14165-314:2013(E) defines the FC-AE-RDMA Upper Level Protocol. FC-AE-RDMA follows the SCSI-3 FCP standard in its definition of the services necessary to support low latency, low overhead communication between elements of a mission-critical avionics system. FC-AE-RDMA is intended to support bi-directional communication between two N_Ports in a constrained and carefully defined environment, typical of avionics applications. The intended
    usage is avionic command, control, instrumentation, simulation, signal processing and sensor/video data distribution. These application areas are characterized by a variety of requirements, among them a need for high reliability, fault tolerance and deterministic behaviour to support real-time control/response.
