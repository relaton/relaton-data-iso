    This International Standard specifies the classification of rectangular windows for ships (series, types and models), and gives the dimensions for interchangeability and construction, materials, tests, marking and designation of these rectangular windows.
    NOTE 1 This International Standard is based on the experience of ships' window and glass manufacturers, shipbuilders and authorities who apply to ships the Regulations of the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, 1974 (SOLAS 1974), as amended, and of the International Convention of Load Lines, 1966, as amended.
