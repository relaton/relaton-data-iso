  content: "This revised International Standard describes a method for determining
    bulk density of solid biofuels with the use of a standardized measuring container.
    This method is applicable to all pourable solid biofuels with a nominal top size
    of maximum 63 mm. while the maximum particle length is 200 mm. For fuels with
    a nominal top size larger than 63 mm, a different method is described. \n\nNote:
    The scope has been changed from the previous version"
