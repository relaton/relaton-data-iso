abstract:
- content: "This document describes a method for performing positron annihilation
    lifetime measurements using a 22Na positron source that decays with β+ emission.
    The β+ (positron) lifetime is determined from a measurement of the lifetime of
    the ortho-positronium which ranges from 1 ns to 10 ns (ascribed to a pore size
    from approximately 0,3 nm to 1,3 nm in diameter), as observed for polymeric materials
    in which the positronium atoms mostly annihilate via a two-gamma annihilation
    process. \nThis document is not applicable to thin surface layers (that are less
    than several micrometers).\nThis document does not apply to measuring:\n— non-positronium
    forming materials; \n— positronium-forming materials that induce a spin conversion
    reaction; \n— positronium-forming materials that contain chemicals influencing
    the annihilation process of ortho-positronium by chemical reactions; \n— positronium-forming
    materials that contain  mesoporous silica gels with a large contribution from
    the three-gamma annihilation process."
