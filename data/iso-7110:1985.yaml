abstract:
- content: A test portion is dissolved in water and acidified with hydrochloric acid.
    The carbon dioxide is eliminated by heating the solution. The lead is complexed
    and extracted with a solution of diethylammonium diethyldithiocarbamate in xylene.
    The solution is aspirated into an acetylene-air flame. The absorption of the 217
    nm line or, alternatively, of the 283.3 nm line emitted by a lead hollow-cathode
    lamp is measured. The method is applicable to products containing more than 0.1
    mg/kg of lead.
