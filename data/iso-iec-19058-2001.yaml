    This International Standard specifies the functional protocol for the support of supplementary services and additional basic call
    capabilities at the Q-reference point. The Q-reference point exists between Private Integrated services Network eXchanges
    (PINX) connected together within a Private Integrated Services Network (PISN) and is defined in ISO/IEC 11579-1. The
    generic functional protocol is part of the B-QSIG signalling system.
    The procedures specified in this International Standard can be used in association with a bearer connection (bearer-related) or
    outside the context of any bearer connection (bearer-independent).The application of this International Standard to individual
    additional basic call capabilities and supplementary services is outside the scope of this International Standard and should be
    defined in those standards or proprietary specifications that specify the individual capabilities.
    All conformance to this International Standard is based on the external behaviour at the interface at the Q-reference point, i.e.
    on the generation of the correct message structure and in the proper sequence as specified in this International Standard.
    The generic functional protocol is based on ATM Forum specification AF-CS-0102.000, which itself is based on the DSS2
    generic functional protocol specified in ITU-T Rec. Q.2932.1 but extended to allow non-local information exchange as well as
    local information exchange.
    This International Standard is applicable to PINXs supporting additional basic call capabilities and/or supplementary services
    requiring the functional protocol for signalling at the Q-reference point.
