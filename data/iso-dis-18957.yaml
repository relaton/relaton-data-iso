- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "This document describes a laboratory test method to determine the aerobic
    biodegradation of plastic materials exposed to seawater using accelerated conditions.
    \nFurthermore, this document describes the general requirements of the apparatus
    and the procedures for using this test method. The biodegradation is determined
    by measuring the oxygen demand in a closed respirometer or by measuring the CO2
    evolved during mineralization of the plastic materials by microorganisms in the
    seawater.\nThis test method is designed to give an early indication of the potential
    biodegradability of plastic materials in marine environment.\nIn addition, for
    the purpose of promoting the development of biodegradable plastics, this document
    also provides a method for measuring the biomass components produced by metabolizing
    the test resin before it is completely mineralized to CO2, that enables to evaluate
    the potential biodegradability considered by carbon flow by the sum of the degree
    of biodegradation based on O2 and/or CO2 analysis and the degree of conversion
    to biomass in much shorter period of time than full mineralization.\nThis method
    is not suitable to assess the degree of disintegration of plastic materials caused
    by abiotic factors like heat or UV radiation. "
