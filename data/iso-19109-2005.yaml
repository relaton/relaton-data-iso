    ISO 19109:2005(E) defines rules for creating and documenting application schemas, including principles for the definition of features. Its scope includes the following:
    - conceptual modelling of features and their properties from a universe of discourse;
    - definition of application schemas;
    - use of the conceptual schema language for application schemas;
    - transition from the concepts in the conceptual model to the data types in the application schema;
    - integration of standardized schemas from other ISO geographic information standards with the application schema.
    The following are outside the scope:
    - choice of one particular conceptual schema language for application schemas;
    - definition of any particular application schema;
    - representation of feature types and their properties in a feature catalogue;
    - representation of metadata;
    - rules for mapping one application schema to another;
    - implementation of the application schema in a computer environment;
    - computer system and application software design;
    - programming.
