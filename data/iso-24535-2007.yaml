    ISO 24535:2007 supports simple systems for "basic electronic registration identification" ("basic ERI") for use in intelligent road transport applications.
    ISO 24535:2007 "basic ERI" defines the: specification of a unique vehicle identifier (using an International Standard, or non-standard, data concept); "basic ERI" functional capabilities, selectable for different "basic ERI" applications; and minimum data interoperability requirements between basic electronic registration tags (ERTs) and electronic registration readers (ERRs).
    ISO 24535:2007 allows, but does not require, vehicle-related data storage in addition to the unique vehicle identifier.
    ISO 24535:2007 is consistent with the ERI architecture defined in ISO/TS 24534-1 and data concepts defined in ISO/TS 24534-3, but is not necessarily interoperable with, the more capable and "fully featured" ERI communication systems to be defined in ISO/TS 24534-4 or ISO/TS 24534-5.
    ISO 24535:2007 defines a "basic ERI" system with security adequate for information that is currently available manually (such as license plate and/or VIN data), but it does not purport to provide the high levels of security required for some administrative requirements. Those requiring high security are advised to follow the relevant parts of ISO/TS 24534.
    Although not part of ISO 24535:2007, the employed technologies supporting ISO 24535:2007 may enable additional non-standard security measures to be added for specific applications
    It is not the purpose of ISO 24535:2007 to define "basic ERI" applications.
    ISO 24535:2007 requires the use of an air interface communication that complies with an international or regional standard whose protocols are publicly defined and available in that standard, but ISO 24535:2007 does not define such an air interface, nor specify which standard air interface is used for any particular implementation.
    ISO 24535:2007 limits its scope to: the requirement that a standard air interface with publicly available protocols is used; the use of data concepts consistent with ISO/TS 24534-3; and the ability to additionally use private data concepts.
