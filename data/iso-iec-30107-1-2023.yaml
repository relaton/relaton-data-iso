    This document establishes terms and definitions that are useful in the specification, characterization and evaluation of presentation attack detection (PAD) methods.
    This document does not provide the following:
    —     standardization of specific PAD detection methods;
    —     detailed information about countermeasures (i.e. anti-spoofing mechanisms), algorithms or sensors;
    —     overall system-level security or vulnerability assessment.
    The attacks to be considered in this document are those that take place at the capture device during the presentation and collection of the biometric characteristics. Any other attacks are considered outside the scope of this document.
