    - manual gas shut-off valve;
    - gas burner valve;
    - appliance connector valve;
    - "delta C" valve.
    ISO 23551-5:2014 applies to valves for gas burners and gas-burning appliances of nominal connection size up to and including DN 100 that can be used and tested independently of these appliances using fuel gases, as natural gas, manufactured gas or liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) at inlet pressures up to and including 500 kPa. It is not applicable to corrosive and waste gases.
