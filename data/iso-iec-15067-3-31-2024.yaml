abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: This document specifies a protocol for energy management agents (EMAs)
    to facilitate communications among these agents for demand response (DR) energy
    management applications. The EMA protocol (EMAP) provides a logical connection
    among EMAs in community housing such as an apartment building or a campus of houses
    or apartment buildings. This document also specifies interaction procedures and
    message formats for DR energy management as introduced in ISO/IEC 15067-3-3. The
    EMAP supports interactions among EMAs at OSI (Open System Interconnection) layer
    7 with a message transfer protocol. An EMA can be embedded in devices such as
    a thermostat, a smart appliance, or other consumer products. The choice of interconnection
    depends on the system and the network topology, which can be arranged in a mesh
    or hierarchical tree structure. An intermediate EMA may relay messages sent between
    EMAs.
