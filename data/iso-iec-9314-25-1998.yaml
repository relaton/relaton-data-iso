    This part of ISO/IEC 9314 contains the Abstract Test Suites for the Fiber Distributed Data Interface
    (FDDI) token ring Station Management (SMT) layer protocol. The SMT Protocol is extensive and very
    complex. In the development process, the protocol was broken into six separate areas. Those areas
    dealt with Physical Connection Management (PCM), Entity Coordination Management (ECM) Ring
    Management (RMT), Configuration Management (CMT), Frame Based Management (FBM) and
    Management Information Base (MIB).
    This SMT ATS is divided along the same boundaries, with the exception that PCM and ECM are
    combined. Those two concepts are tested together. The formal description language used for
    Abstract Test Suite (ATS) development is Tree and Tabular Combined Notational (TTCN) and is
    defined in ISO 9646Framework. TTCN is intended for higher layer protocol testing and requires the
    use of discreet Protocol Data Units (PDUs). The TTCN notation is used in the test cases for RMT,
    FBM and MIB. It cannot be used for PCM, ECM and CFM. These three protocols use line states as
    the method of conveying information.
    The TTCN (P) is similar in structure to TTCN but changes the paradigm from PDUs to line states. A
    description of the concept of TTCN (P) can be found in the beginning of section 6, PCM.
