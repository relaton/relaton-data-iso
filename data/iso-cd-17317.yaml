abstract:
- content: "This document provides guidelines for the characterization of native species
    and products based on native species, which have been collected, harvested and/or
    processed, to enable the establishment of minimum quality and safety requirements
    considering sustainable management of biodiversity. A special focus is on biodiversity
    protection along all steps of the value chain of those products.\nCharacterization
    of native species and products allows to determine requirements that have not
    been considered, providing this information to interested parties, including farmers,
    producers, exporters, importers and authorities, as well as consumers and users.
    \nThis document applies to native species and products based on native species
    from plants, algae and fungi collected or harvested. This document does not apply
    to native animal species and wood products. "
