abstract:
- content: |-
    The main objective of this document is to provide guidelines for product characterization of native species. These practical guidelines establish and standardize minimum requirements for quality and performance of native species and their derived products, guiding national authorities, national standards bodies, national technical committees, and other stakeholders; including exporters or importers of products derived from native species, as well as consumers and users, in the development of standards on this matter so as to contribute to conservations efforts and the sustainable use of biodiversity resources.
    This document considers the product characterization of products derived from native species that have been collected or harvested, and which results may enable the drafting of international standards.
    This document may be used by producers, importers, exporters, as well as consumers and users of products derived from native species as technical support for characterizing native species products.
