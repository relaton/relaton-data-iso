- content: |-
    This document specifies the essential dimensional characteristics of piston pins with a nominal outer diameter from 8 mm up to and including 100 mm, for reciprocating internal combustion engines for road vehicles and other applications. In certain applications, except road vehicles, and provided that mutual agreement is made between the customer and the manufacturer, this document can be used with suitable modifications.
    In addition, it establishes a vocabulary, a pin-type classification, material description based on mechanical properties, common features and quality requirements.
    The use of this document can require a manufacturer and customer statistical process control agreement.
