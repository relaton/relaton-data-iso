    This document specifies two procedures for the in situ determination of the insertion loss of underwater noise abatement measures (noise abatement systems). The impulsive sound of pile driving is used as the sound source for the investigation of noise abatement systems. This document does not apply to artificial sound sources and investigations under laboratory conditions.
    Apart from the correct application of the respective noise abatement system, the achieved sound attenuation also depends on the installation conditions (e.g. type of hammer, driving energy, pile dimensioning) as well as on the environmental conditions (e.g. water depth, seafloor classification and bathymetry, current and wind conditions) and the flanking transmission via the seafloor.
