- content: |-
    ISO/TR 10992-2:2017 specifies the introduction of multimedia and telematics nomadic devices in the public transport and automotive world to support intelligent transport systems (ITS) service provisions and multimedia use such as passenger information, automotive information, driver advisory and warning systems, and entertainment system interfaces to ITS service providers and motor vehicle communication networks.
    ISO/TR 10992-2:2017 focuses on the convergence software framework to identify mobile cloud connectivity services while driving utilizing nomadic device application for intelligent transport systems (ITS) technologies in vehicles.
    The use cases described in this document include:
    -      IVI interaction configuration
    This competence is provided by automatic application suppliers.
    -      Biosignal measurement configuration
    This competence is provided by IT application companies.
    -      Cloud service configuration
    This competence is provided by third-party providers such as parking service providers and insurance service providers.
    ISO/TR 10992-2:2017 includes the identification of existing International Standards for ITS in ISO/TC 204 and existing vehicle communication network access standards.
