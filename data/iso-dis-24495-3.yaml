abstract:
- content: 'This [proposed] standard is for anybody who creates or helps create scientific
    documents intended for diverse audiences. It builds, and relies, on the foundation
    for plain language in ISO/DIS 24495-1, Plain Language — Part 1: Governing Principles
    and Guidelines. It does not repeat the guidance in Part 1. Rather, it adds guidance
    and techniques to help authors make sure that readers or users of scientific information
    can understand and make use of what they read. It applies only to printed or digital
    information that is primarily in the form of text. It does not include existing
    technical guidance about accessibility and digital documents, although its guidance
    can apply to both.'
