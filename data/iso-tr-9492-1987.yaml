abstract:
- content: Is intended to be a guideline for code-writers. Can be applied to the determination
    of unfavourable characteristic values of temperature difference due to temperature
    climatic actions which are taken into account in static analysis of structures
    for which the variation of temperature within the cross-section can be treated
    as linear. Is not applicable to massive structures (dams, retaining walls, tunnels,
    bridge piers ets.). For condideration of such structures it may be necessary to
    take into account non-linear distribution ot temperature through the body of the
    massive structural elements.
