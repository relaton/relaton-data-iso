  content: "ISO/TR 13054:2012 describes a standards knowledge management (SKM) methodology
    and metadata to support the easy identification of the existence of a health informatics
    standard, its developmental status, and its associated Standards Development Organization
    (SDO). In particular, it describes a knowledge-based navigation methodology to
    enable rapid appreciation of the contextual roles and purposes of a standard,
    including the relationship between one standard and others, particularly in the
    same standards domain. \nISO/TR 13054:2012 also gives information about the design
    of tools to support knowledge management of health informatics standards."
