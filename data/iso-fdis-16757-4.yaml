  content: "The focus of ISO 16757 is the support of manufacturers to provide their
    product data in electronic product catalogues. The standard - ISO 16757 Part 4:
    Dictionaries for product catalogues – describes which data structures are required
    in a dictionary to support the exchange of product data from manufacturers to
    designers of building services systems. \n\nBasis for this specification are the
    standards ISO 12006-3 and ISO 23386. \n\nIn the scope of this standard are the
    following elements:\n\n-\tThe definition of roles of ISO 12006-3 subjects that
    are needed to describe the concepts used in current product catalogue dictionaries.
    These roles include the following:\no\tProduct classes to represent product groups
    with similar property sets\no\tBlocks that represent reusable and multiply used
    set of properties\no\tSystem classes that represent the systems into which a product
    may be installed and provide the system properties which determine the values
    of dependent product properties \no\tPort classes that allow the product independent
    description of different kinds of ports which can be used for the definition of
    product classes or blocks\no\tCatalogue classes that describe the meta data of
    a catalogue\no\tTagging classes that allow the tagging of properties to distinguish
    property roles in the product description\n-\tA requirement model capturing the
    necessary structures to describe these roles\n-\tA mapping to the dictionary model
    of ISO 12006-3."
