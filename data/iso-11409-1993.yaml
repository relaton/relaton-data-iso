- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: The principle of the method specified is measuring the heat flux supplied
    to a test sample as a function of time or temperature, while the test sample is
    subjected to a temperature schedule under a specified atmosphere. A reaction is
    marked by the release of energy from the sample, resulting in an exothermic peak
    in the heating curve. Integration of the recorded peak area as a function of time
    gives a measure of the energy of the reaction. Applies to phenolic resins with
    exothermic behaviour, such as resols or mixtures of novolaks with hexamethylenetetramine
    or other curing agents.
