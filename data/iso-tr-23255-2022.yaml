    A variety of general-purpose data distribution technologies have emerged within the Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) industry. These technologies generally provide services at the Open System Interconnect (OSI) session, presentation and application layers (i.e. layers 5-7). Within Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS), these layers roughly correspond to the facilities layer of the ITS station (ITS-S) reference architecture, as defined within ISO 21217.
    This document investigates the applicability of these data distribution technologies within the ITS environment.
