    ISO 16404:2013 presents the requirements for Requirements Management (RM) for space projects.
    ISO 16404:2013 addresses the space programme/project management requirements, applicable through a top-down approach in a contractual relationship between customers and suppliers.
    The objective of ISO 16404:2013 is to state and establish a common reference framework for all the customers and suppliers in the space sector to deploy Requirements Management for all space products and projects.
    ISO 16404:2013 on Requirements Management includes
    ?   a definition of the Requirements Management scope for the space sector,
    ?   the standard processes for Requirements Management within the product lifecycle management, and
    ?   a set of rules for Requirements Management activities to be implemented by the actors (customers and suppliers), including rules derived from best practices.
