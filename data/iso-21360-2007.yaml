    ISO 21360:2007 is a basic standard which defines three different methods for measuring the volume flow rate and one method each for measuring the base pressure, the compression ratio and the critical backing pressure of a vacuum pump.
    The choice of the required measurement methods depends on the properties of the specific kinds of vacuum pump, e.g. the measurement of the critical backing pressure is only necessary for vacuum pumps which need a backing pump. All data that is measured on a vacuum pump but not described in ISO 21360:2007 (e.g. measurement of power consumption) is defined in the specific pump standard.
