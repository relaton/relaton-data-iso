    This document surveys topics related to trustworthiness in AI systems, including the following:
    —     approaches to establish trust in AI systems through transparency, explainability, controllability, etc.;
    —     engineering pitfalls and typical associated threats and risks to AI systems, along with possible mitigation techniques and methods; and
    —     approaches to assess and achieve availability, resiliency, reliability, accuracy, safety, security and privacy of AI systems.
    The specification of levels of trustworthiness for AI systems is out of the scope of this document.
