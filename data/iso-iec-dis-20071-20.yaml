abstract:
- content: "This document provides requirements and recommendations on the development
    of accessible audiovisual content. \nIt requires and recommends a variety of different
    accessibility components, dealt with in further detail in additional parts of
    the ISO 20071 series, that meet different user accessibility needs. It also provides
    guidance related to translations, localizations, timing, importance, and other
    general aspects of the creation of these accessibility components.\nThis document
    does not apply to the presentation devices or transmission mechanisms used to
    deliver audiovisual content. These devices could include, but are not limited
    to: televisions, computers, wireless devices, projection equipment, DVD and home
    cinema equipment, video game consoles, or any similar devices which use displays
    for visual presentation and other forms of user interfaces technology. This document
    does not apply to transcoding files and formats for the various video outputs.\nThis
    document helps to improve accessibility. This document does not establish requirements
    on specific industries (e.g. television broadcasting, motion pictures) nor is
    it intended to supersede specific international standards within their domain."
