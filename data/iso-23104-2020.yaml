    This Recommended Standard defines the Monitored Data service in terms of:
    a)    the CSTS procedures that constitute the service;
    b)    the extensions and refinements of the behavior of those CSTS procedures necessary to provide the transfer service;
    c)    the extensions and refinements of standard CSTS operations associated with each of the procedures;
    d)    the relationships among the procedures that constitute the service.
    It does not specify:
    a)    individual implementations or products;
    b)    the implementation of entities or interfaces within real systems;
    c)    the methods or technologies required to measure the values of monitored parameters and to detect the occurrence of events of interest;
    d)    the methods or technologies required for communication;
    e)    the management activities necessary to schedule, configure, and control the MD-CSTS;
    f)     the specific parameters that are to be reported and events that are to be notified by the MD-CSTS.
