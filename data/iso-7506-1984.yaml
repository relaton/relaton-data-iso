  content: Covers continuous pattern cards, banded pattern cards, Jacquard machines,
    comber boards and harness cord guides for the manufacture of fabrics, the face
    sides of which lie uppermost in the weaving machine. Does not cover Jacquard equipment
    for special patterns (for example, symmetrical harnesses) where the standardized
    pattern holes, hooks and harness cords do not control the first warp threads but
    rather those determined by the particular type of equipment used.
