abstract:
- content: "IEC/IEEE 80005-1:2019 describes high-voltage shore connection (HVSC) systems,
    onboard the ship and on shore, to supply the ship with electrical power from shore.
    This document is applicable to the design, installation and testing of HVSC systems
    and addresses:\n- HV shore distribution systems,\n- shore-to-ship connection and
    interface equipment,\n- transformers/reactors,\n- semiconductor/rotating frequency
    convertors,\n- ship distribution systems, and\n- control, monitoring, interlocking
    and power management systems.\nIt does not apply to the electrical power supply
    during docking periods, for example dry docking and other out of service maintenance
    and repair. Additional and/or alternative requirements can be imposed by national
    administrations or the authorities within whose jurisdiction the ship is intended
    to operate and/or by the owners or authorities responsible for a shore supply
    or distribution system. It is expected that HVSC systems will have practicable
    applications for ships requiring 1 MVA or more or ships with HV main supply. Low-voltage
    shore connection systems are not covered by this document. This second edition
    cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2012. This edition constitutes
    a technical revision. This edition includes the following significant technical
    changes with respect to the previous edition:\na) modification of 4.1, Figure
    1: transformer on ship is optional, earthing switches on ship removed;\nb) 4.2.2
    and new item 11.3: alternative procedure of periodic testing added;\nc) modification
    of 4.9:\n- minimum current value in the safety circuits shall be 50 mA;\n- opening
    of safety loop shall cause the automatic opening of ship and shore HVSC circuit
    breakers in a maximum time of 200 ms;\nd) modification of 5.2: added Figure on
    harmonic contents;\ne) modification of 6.2.3:\n\x96 earthing transformer with
    resistor can be used also on the secondary side;\n\x96 neutral earthing resistor
    rating in amperes shall be minimum 25 A, 5 s;\nf) modification of all annexes:
    the safety circuits shall be mandatory;\ng) modification of A.2.1: a metallic
    shield shall be installed at least on the power cores or common on pilot wires;\nh)
    modification of B.7.2.1: new safety circuit introduced: single line diagram and
    description;\ni) modification of C.4.1: SLD for cruise ships was updated, also
    the safety circuits to be coherent with main body, IEC symbols and introduced
    more details about the control socket-outlets and plugs manufacturer type;\nj)
    modification of C.7.3.1:\n- shore power connector pin assignment is updated;\n-
    all cruise ships shall use 4 cables in all cases;\nk) added D.6.1: the supply
    point on shore can be fixed or movable;\nl) modification of D.7.3.2: the voltage
    used in the pilot circuit for container ships shall be less than 60 V DC or 25
    V AC.\nm) added D.8.6 and D.9.3.1: automatic restart and synchronization alternatives;\nn)
    Annex E set to informative;\no) Annex F set to informative."
