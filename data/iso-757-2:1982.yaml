abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: The principle of the method consists in dilution of a test portion with
    carbon dioxide-free water, titration of the test solution, if acid, with standard
    volumetric sodium hydroxide solution, using phenolphthalein as indicator. The
    method is applicable to products having acidities, expressed as acetic acid, equal
    to or greater than 0,0006 % (m/m). International Standards ISO 757/1 to ISO 757/5
    cancel and replace ISO Recommendation R 757-1968, of which they constitute a technical
    revision. This document has also been approved by the International Union of Pure
    and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC).
