    This document specifies the measurement methods and specification of image quality of lenticular prints that are used for changing images. This document does not cover lenticular prints that are used for 3D images.
    NOTE       Lenticular prints for 3D images can be measured with the same types of procedures. However, it needs more information, such as the dependence of the measurement distance, to evaluate the 3D performance.
    This document specifically describes measurement methods for cross-talk, viewing angle range, angular misalignment from the designed viewing angle and the uniformity of the image within the printing area of the lenticular print images. These are critical for the image quality of lenticular prints for changing images.
    This document is applicable to lenticular prints produced by printing technologies that include impact and non-impact printing. Examples of the former are off-set, gravure and flexography, while the examples of the latter are silver halide, inkjet, dye diffusion thermal transfer and electrophotography. The multiple laser images (MLI) and changeable laser images (CLI) process of using a laser to write through a lenticular screen at different angles to create multiple images is also used.
