  content: "This document proposes a standard test procedure to assess the efficiency
    of cleaning systems for sensors. It addresses the following conditions:\n—    
    dust/mud\n—     frost/snow\n—     mist/rain\nThis document does not propose a
    preferred cleaning system. This document is intended to be technologically neutral
    and performance-oriented. Its focus is on the cleaning system, not on sensor detection.
    The assessment method specified in this document is therefore fully independent
    from sensor technology and from the data generated by the sensor when in use.\nThis
    document is entirely focussed on the cleanliness of the front surface of the sensor.\nThis
    document does not address continuous contamination, such as continuous rain. This
    is because in these circumstances, the efficiency of the cleaning system can only
    be assessed from inside the sensor.\nFor non-continuous contamination, this document
    includes intermittent cleaning, which is considered a succession of cleaning cycles
    that are launched periodically, as defined in 3.2.\nThe test does not include
    specific day time/night time conditions. This is because these conditions have
    no impact on the results and the average clean remains similar. However, more
    efficient cleaning can be done at night.\nThis document does not cover contamination
    with insects due to the challenges of ensuring homogeneous application. \nThis
    document does not provide indicators for sensor performance. This document is
    limited to the evaluation of the removal of contamination from surfaces. \nThis
    document does not include evaluation on preventive measures taken in the installation
    design. The aerodynamic design affects how mud sprayed from a moving vehicle or
    rain droplets can reach and build-up on the sensor's frontal protection layer.
    Countermeasure design is beyond the scope of this document."
