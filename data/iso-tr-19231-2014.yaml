    ISO/TR 19231:2014 surveys ongoing national mHealth projects in LMIC, to which some emerging technologies such as zero configuration and proximity computing are applicable, especially when the information and communication technology (ICT) infrastructure is not established in those countries.
    The scope is constrained to mHealth use cases and technologies for information and communication infrastructures that are useful for LMICs. In addition, the purpose of this Technical Report is to survey not only national mHealth projects in LMICs, but also possible mHealth frameworks that might be used.
