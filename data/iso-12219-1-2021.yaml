    This document specifies the whole vehicle test chamber, the vapour sampling assembly and the operating conditions for the determination of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and carbonyl compounds in vehicle cabin air. There are three measurements performed: one (for VOCs and carbonyl compounds) during the simulation of ambient conditions (ambient mode) at standard conditions of 23 °C - 25 °C with no air exchange; a second only for the measurement of formaldehyde at elevated temperatures (parking mode); and a third for VOCs and carbonyl compounds simulating driving after the vehicle has been parked in the sun starting at elevated temperatures (driving mode). For the simulation of the mean sun irradiation, a fixed irradiation in the whole vehicle test chamber is employed.
    The VOC method is valid for measurement of non-polar and slightly polar VOCs in a concentration range of sub-micrograms per cubic metre up to several milligrams per cubic metre. Using the principles specified in this method, some semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOC) can also be analysed. Compatible compounds are those which can be trapped and released from the Tenax TA®[1] sorbent tubes described in ISO 16000‑6, which includes VOCs ranging in volatility from n-C6 to n-C16.
    The sampling and analysis procedure for formaldehyde and other carbonyl compounds is performed by collecting air on to cartridges coated with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH) and subsequent analysis by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with detection by ultraviolet absorption. Formaldehyde and other carbonyl compounds can be determined in the approximate concentration range 1 µg/m3 to 1 mg/m3.
    The method is valid for passenger cars, as defined in ECE-TRANS-WP.29/1045.
    This document gives guidelines for:
    a) transport and storage of the test vehicles until the start of the test;
    b) conditioning for the surroundings of the test vehicle and the test vehicle itself as well as the whole vehicle test chamber;
    c) conditioning of the test vehicle prior to measurements;
    d) simulation of ambient air conditions (ambient mode);
    e) formaldehyde sampling at elevated temperatures (parking mode);
    f) simulation of driving after the test vehicle has been parked in the sun (driving mode).
     
    [1] Tenax TA® is the trade name of a product supplied by Buchem. This information is given for the convenience of users of this document and does not constitute an endorsement by ISO of the product named. Equivalent products may be used if they can be shown to lead to the same results.
