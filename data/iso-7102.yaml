    This document specifies a method for the determination of β-galactooligosaccharides (GOS) in infant formula (both powder and liquid) containing 0,2 g/100 g to 3,0 g/100 g of GOS in the product as prepared ready for consumption.
    The method has been validated in a multi laboratory study with reconstituted infant formula at levels of 0,236 g/100 g, 0,594 g/100 g, 0,616 g/100 g and 0,688 g/100 g and infant formula RTF at levels of 0,316 g/100 g and 0,858 g/100 g. During the single laboratory validation study spike-recovery experiments were performed up to 3 g/100 g in reconstituted infant formula powders (milk-based, partially hydrolysed milk-based and soy-based), and reconstituted adult nutritional powders.
