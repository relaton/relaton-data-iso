    This document specifies a test method for steering effort measurement when manoeuvring a vehicle at low speed or with the vehicle stationary. It is mainly applicable to trucks having a mass exceeding 3,5 tonnes and buses and articulated buses having a mass exceeding 5 tonnes, according to ECE and EC vehicle classification, i.e. categories M3, N2, N3.
    This document can also be applicable to trucks having a mass not exceeding 3,5 tonnes and buses and articulated buses having a mass not exceeding 5 tonnes, i.e. categories M2, N1.
