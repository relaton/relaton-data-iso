    This document establishes a common basis for, and assistance in, the classification of applications and multiphase meters, as well as guidance and recommendations for the implementation and use of such meters.
    The so-called in-line multiphase flow meters (MPFMs) that directly measure the oil, water and gas flow rates, as well as the partial- and full-separation MPFMs are the main focus of this document. Conventional two- or three-phase separators are not included in this document. Only limited reference is made to wet-gas meters, since although wet-gas flow is a subset of multiphase flow, wet-gas measurement is covered by ISO/TR 11583 and ISO/TR 12748.
