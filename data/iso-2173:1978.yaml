abstract:
- content: The method is particularly applicable to thick products, to products containing
    suspendes matter and to products rich in sugars. If the products contain other
    dissolved substances, the results will be only approximate, nevertheless they
    may be considered conventionally as the soluble solids content. The principle
    consists in measuring of the refractive index of a test solution at 20 °C, using
    a refractometer, and use of tables correlating refractive index with soluble solids
    contents (expressed as sucrose), or direct reading of the content on the instrument.
