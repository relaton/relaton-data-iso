abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: Fibre Channel is a high speed serial interface using either optical or
    electrical connections (i.e., the physical layer) at data rates currently up to
    2 Gbits/s with a growth path to 10 Gbits/s, and provides a general data transport
    vehicle for Upper Level Protocols (ULPs) such as Intelligent Peripheral Interface
    (IPI) and Small Computer System Interface (SCSI) command sets, the High-Performance
    Parallel Interface (HIPPI) data framing, IP (Internet Protocol), ANSI/IEEE 802.2,
    and others. The topologies supported by Fibre Channel include point-to-point,
    switched fabric, and arbitrated loop. This part of ISO/IEC 14165 defines an upper-layer
    protocol within the domain of Fibre Channel, that is designed to permit efficient
    peer-to-peer or client-server messaging between nodes, and to comply with the
    Virtual Interface (VI) Architecture. Vendors that wish to implement devices that
    connect to FC-VI may follow the requirements of this and other normatively referenced
    standards to manufacture an FC-VI compliant device.
