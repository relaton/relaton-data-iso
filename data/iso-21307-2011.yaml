abstract:
- content: ISO 21307:2011 establishes general principles regarding the procedure used
    in the construction and quality assessment of butt fusion joints incorporating
    fittings (ISO 8085-2) and pipes used in the construction of gas (ISO 4437) and
    water (ISO 4427) distribution systems made with equipment that complies with ISO
    12176-1 and installed in accordance with ISO/TS 10839, relevant codes of practice,
    national regulations or industry guidance. Specifically, ISO 21307:2011 specifies
    a number of proven butt fusion jointing procedures for pipes and fittings with
    a wall thickness up to and including 70 mm. ISO 21307:2011 takes into consideration
    the materials and components used, the fusion jointing procedure and equipment
    and the quality assessment of the completed joint. It can be applied in conjunction
    with appropriate national regulations and standards.
