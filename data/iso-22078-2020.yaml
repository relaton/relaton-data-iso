    This document specifies the concept of operation, minimum functionality, system requirements, system interfaces, and test procedures for bicyclist detection and collision mitigation systems (BDCMS). It also defines the system test criteria necessary to verify that a given implementation meets the requirements of this document. Implementation choices are left to system designers, wherever possible.
    BDCMS are fundamentally intended to provide emergency braking (EB) of equipped vehicles in order to mitigate collision severity between the subject vehicle (SV) and a bicyclist. BDCMS detect bicyclists forward of the SV, determine if the detected bicyclists are in a hazardous situation with respect to the SV, and initiate EB if a hazardous situation exists and a collision is imminent. Systems that include other countermeasures such as evasive steering are outside the scope of this document.
    This document defines two types of BDCMS (based on operation in different ambient illuminance) and two classes of BDCMS (based on operation on different vehicle size classes), as depicted in Table 1. This document does not apply to motorcycles. The operational design domain is public roads. BDCMS is not intended for off-road use.
    Responsibility for the safe operation of the vehicle remains with the driver.
    Licensable motor vehicles intended for use on public roads (i.e. motorcycles, cars, light trucks, buses, motor coaches), and other heavy vehicles as hazards are outside the scope of this document and are covered under ISO 22839.
    Pedestrians are outside the scope of this document and are covered under ISO 19237.
    Annex A contains informative information relative to BDCMS.
