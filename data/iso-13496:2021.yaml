abstract:
- content: 'This document specifies a detection method using thin-layer chromatography
    and a determination method using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)
    for synthetic colouring agents in meat and meat products.This document specifies
    the HPLC method as the reference method.This document is applicable to meat and
    meat products, including livestock and poultry products.The method using thin-layer
    chromatography can detect the following colouring agents: Tartrazine, Patent Blue
    V, Quinoline Yellow, Indigotine, Sunset Yellow FCF, Brilliant Black PN, Amaranth,
    Black 7984, Ponceau 4R, Fast Green FCF, Erythrosine, Blue VRS.Synonyms and identity
    numbers of these colouring agents are listed in Annex A. The plant colours and
    plant extracts which have been observed not to interfere with this method are
    listed in B.1. Natural colours which in some cases have been shown to interfere
    with this method are listed in B.2.The method using HPLC can detect the following
    colouring agents: Tartrazine, Allura Red AC, Amaranth, Brilliant Blue FCF, Ponceau
    4R, New Red, Sunset Yellow FCF, Carmoisine, Erythrosine, Indigotine.Chromatograms
    of these standard reference colours are shown in Annex D.'
