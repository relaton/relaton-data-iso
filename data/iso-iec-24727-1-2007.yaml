    ISO/IEC 24727 is a set of programming interfaces for interactions between integrated circuit cards and external applications to include generic services for multi-sector use. The organization and the operation of the ICC conform to ISO/IEC 7816-4.
    ISO/IEC 24727-1:2007 specifies
    - system architecture and principles of operation,
    - a capabilities discovery mechanism,
    - security rationale.
    It does not cover the internal implementation within the card or the outside world.
    ISO/IEC 24727-1:2007 is independent of the physical interface technology. It applies to cards accessed by one or more of the following methods: contacts, close coupling and radio frequency.
