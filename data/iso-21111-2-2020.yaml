    This document specifies the following items to complement ISO/IEC /IEEE 8802‑3:
    —     interface between reconciliation sublayer and physical entity including reduced gigabit media independent interface (RGMII);
    —     common physical entity wake-up and synchronised link sleep functionalities independent from physical media and transmission bit rate.
    The optical and electrical component requirements and test methods for optical and electrical transmission of in-vehicle Ethernet are not in the scope of this document.
