    ISO 20107:2015 is one of a family of documents specifying the Spacecraft Onboard Interface Services (SOIS)-compliant service to be provided in support of applications.
    ISO 20107:2015 defines the SOIS Device Virtualisation Service (DVS). The definition encompasses specification of the service interface exposed to onboard software (user applications and libraries) as well as the conceptual mapping of the DVS primitives to the protocols implementing such services.
    The SOIS DVS is for use by onboard software to provide a standard interface between onboard software applications and flight hardware such as sensors and actuators.
