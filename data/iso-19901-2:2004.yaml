  content: "ISO 19901-2:2004 contains requirements for defining the seismic design
    procedures and criteria for offshore structures; guidance on the requirements
    is included. The requirements are applicable to fixed steel structures and fixed
    concrete structures. The effects of seismic events on floating structures and
    partially buoyant structures are also briefly discussed. The site-specific assessment
    of jack-ups in elevated condition is only covered in ISO 19901-2:2004 to the extent
    that the requirements are applicable. \nOnly earthquake-induced ground motions
    are addressed in detail. Other geologically-induced hazards such as liquefaction,
    slope instability, faults, tsunamis, mud volcanoes and shock waves are mentioned
    and briefly discussed. \nThe requirements are intended to reduce risks to persons,
    the environment, and assets to the lowest levels that are reasonably practicable.
    This intent is achieved by using seismic design procedures which are dependent
    on the platform's exposure level and the expected intensity of seismic events
    and a two-level seismic design check in which the structure is designed to the
    ultimate limit state (ULS) for strength and stiffness and then checked to abnormal
    environmental events or the accidental limit state (ALS) to ensure that it meets
    reserve strength and energy dissipation requirements.\nFor high seismic areas
    and/or high exposure level fixed structures, a site-specific seismic hazard assessment
    is required; for such cases, the procedures and requirements for a site-specific
    probabilistic seismic hazard analysis (PSHA) are addressed. However, a thorough
    explanation of PSHA procedures is not included.\nWhere a simplified design approach
    is allowed, worldwide offshore maps are included that show the intensity of ground
    shaking corresponding to a return period of 1 000 years. In such cases, these
    maps may be used with corresponding scale factors to determine appropriate seismic
    actions for the design of a structure."
