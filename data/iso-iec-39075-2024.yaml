    This document defines data structures and basic operations on property graphs. It provides capabilities for creating, accessing, querying, maintaining, and controlling property graphs and the data they comprise.
    This document specifies the syntax and semantics of a data management language for specifying and modifying the structure of property graphs and collections thereof.
    This document provides a vehicle for portability of data definitions and manipulation among GQL-implementations. Implementations of this document can exist in environments that also support application programming languages, end-user query facilities, and various tools for database design, data administration, and performance optimization.
