    ISO 10896-2:2016 specifies general safety requirements for slewing rough-terrain variable-reach trucks (hereafter known as "trucks"), consisting of a lower chassis with a slewing upper structure equipped with a telescopic lifting means (pivoted boom), on which a load handling device (e.g., carriage and fork arms) is typically fitted. Fork arms and other integrated attachments are considered to be parts of the truck.
    Other standards, in addition to the relevant provisions of this part of ISO 10896, can apply to the attachments.
    ISO 10896-2:2016 is not applicable to the following:
    a) rough terrain variable-reach trucks covered by ISO 10896‑1 (non-slewing);
    b) industrial variable-reach trucks covered by ISO 3691‑2;
    c) mobile cranes;
    d) machines designed primarily for earth-moving, such as loaders, even if their buckets are replaced by fork arms (see ISO 20474);
    e) trucks designed primarily with variable-length load suspension elements (e.g. chain, ropes) from which the load may swing freely in all directions;
    NOTE Additional requirements for trucks intended for freely swinging load applications, their lifting devices and attachments, and personnel/work platform applications on trucks, are being developed by ISO/TC 110/SC4.
    f) trucks designed primarily for container handling.
    The significant hazards covered by this part of ISO 10896 are listed in Annex A. This part of ISO 10896 does not address hazards that can occur
    - during manufacture,
    - when handling suspended loads, which may swing freely,
    - when lifting personnel,
    - when using trucks on public roads,
    - when operating in potentially explosive atmospheres, or
    - with a battery, LPG or hybrid as the primary power source.
