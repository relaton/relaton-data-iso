    ISO 17068:2017 specifies requirements for a trusted third party repository (TTPR) to support the authorized custody service in order to safeguard provable integrity and authenticity of clients' digital records and serve as a source of reliable evidence.
    ISO 17068:2017 is applicable to retention or repository services for digital records as a source of evidence during the retention periods of legal obligation in both the private and the public sectors.
    ISO 17068:2017 has the limitation that the authorized custody of the stored records is between only the TTPR and the client.
