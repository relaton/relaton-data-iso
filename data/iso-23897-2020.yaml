    This document specifies the elements of an unambiguous scheme to identify a financial transaction uniquely whenever useful and agreed by the parties or community involved in the transaction.
    It does not specify the timing of assignment of who should be responsible for its generation, so as not to limit its usage or relevance, nor does it consider a need to establish a data record for the unique transaction identifier (UTI) itself.
