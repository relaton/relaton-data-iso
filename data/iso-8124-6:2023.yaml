    This document specifies a method standard for the determination of di-iso-butyl phthalate (DIBP), di-n-butyl phthalate (DBP), benzyl-butyl phthalate (BBP), bis-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), di-n-octyl phthalate (DNOP), di-iso-nonyl phthalate (DINP) and di-iso-decyl phthalate (DIDP) in toys. It can also be applied to other phthalate esters (see G.2) if adequate validation is demonstrated.
    This document applies to toys made of plastics, textiles, coatings and liquids. This document has been validated for polyvinylchloride (PVC) and polyurethane (PU) plastics and some representative paint coatings (see Annex B).
    This document can also be applied to other product categories.
