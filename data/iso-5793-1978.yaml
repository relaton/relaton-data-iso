abstract:
- content: Is applicable to products having chloride contents, expressed as chlorine,
    greater than 2 mg/kg. The principle of determination consists in extracting the
    chlorides by boilling a test portion in aqueous 2-propanol, followed by a quantitative
    displacement of the thiocyanate ions of mercury(II) thiocynate by the chloride
    ions contained in an aliquot portion of the extraction solution, and reaction
    of the thiocyanate ions with iron(III) nitrate to form iron(III) thiocyanate.
