    This part of ISO 16063 specifies the instrumentation and procedure to be used for primary vibration calibration of
    rectilinear accelerometers (with or without amplifier) to obtain magnitude and phase lag of the complex sensitivity
    by steady-state sinusoidal vibration and laser interferometry.
    It is applicable to a frequency range from 1 Hz to 10 kHz and a dynamic range (amplitude) from 0,1 m/s2 to
    1 000 m/s2 (frequency-dependent).
    These ranges are covered with the uncertainty of measurement specified in clause 2. Calibration frequencies lower
    than 1 Hz (e.g. 0,4 Hz, which is a reference frequency used in other International Standards) and acceleration
    amplitudes smaller than 0,1 m/s2 (e.g. 0,004 m/s2 at 1 Hz) can be achieved using Method 3 specified in this part of
    ISO 16063, in conjunction with an appropriate low-frequency vibration generator.
    Method 1 (fringe-counting method) is applicable to sensitivity magnitude calibration in the frequency range 1 Hz to
    800 Hz and, under special conditions, at higher frequencies (cf. clause 7). Method 2 (minimum-point method) can
    be used for sensitivity magnitude calibration in the frequency range 800 Hz to 10 kHz (cf. clause 8). Method 3
    (sine-approximation method) can be used for magnitude of sensitivity and phase calibration in the frequency range
    1 Hz to 10 kHz (cf. clause 9).
    Methods 1 and 3 provide for calibrations at fixed acceleration amplitudes at various frequencies. Method 2 requires
    calibrations at fixed displacement amplitudes (acceleration amplitude varies with frequency).
