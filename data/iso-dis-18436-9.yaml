    This document reflects on the qualification of personnel performing Optical Gas Imaging (OGI) for
    fugitive emissions. The intention is to add a sub-category to ISO 18436 for this specific purpose as OGI
    requires a set of skills that is different than the traditional infrared condition monitoring. The skill set
    includes many similarities between traditional condition monitoring, such as system and component
    knowledge, but differs in that the user must recognize the conditions for successful gas imaging.
    Knowledge of Chemistry is essential as well as detector Physics to determine the proper wavelength
    instrument.
    The document is intended for end users, contractors, consultants, service providers and
    manufacturers.
