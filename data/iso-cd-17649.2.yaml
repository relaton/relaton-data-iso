    Develop an ISO/IEC IS or directive for Model-Based Standards (MBS) Authoring (MBSA), which
    specifies how to create a new IS or evolve an exiting IS, such that rather than being based on free text,
    it shall be based on an ISO 19450 OPM model. The new IS will itself be prepared based on the
    specification it contains, thus it will be the first MBSA IS and will serve both as a specification and an
    example of how to create the new generation of model-based ISO ISs.
