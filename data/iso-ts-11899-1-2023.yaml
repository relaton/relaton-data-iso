  content: This document specifies a test procedure, equipment and environment for
    evaluating the concentration loss of ultrafine bubbles (UFB) due to long-distance
    transfer of ultrafine bubble water in a plastic pipe. The test results are analysed
    and expressed in terms of a formula with the flow parameters, pipe length, flow
    velocity and number of circulations through the pipe. The formula is intended
    to be used for designing long-distance transport system for industrial applications
    including agro- and aqua- farming.
