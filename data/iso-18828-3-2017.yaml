    ISO 18828-3:2017 describes the information flows identified for each planning discipline within production planning, according to ISO 18828‑2.
    The following aspects are within the scope of ISO 18828-3:2017:
    ·          general overview of the main information flows within the reference planning process;
    ·          basic pattern to describe the main information flows;
    ·          detailed description of every main information flow;
    ·          state notation structure of the main information flows objects;
    ·          detailed descriptions for each information object state;
    ·          proposal of checklists for benchmarking information objects.
    The following items are outside the scope of ISO 18828-3:2017:
    ·         information flows to intersecting areas, including high-level planning;
    ·         data models for production planning;
    ·         complete description of all possible information flows/objects within production planning;
    ·         workflow engines for automated production planning;
    ·         production facilities planning/manufacturing facilities planning (physical plant and equipment); including any kind of resource that is not directly related to the manufacturing process;
    ·         value chain (inbound logistics, operations management, outbound logistics, marketing and sales);
    ·         process simulation/safeguarding;
    ·         investment planning during production process management.
