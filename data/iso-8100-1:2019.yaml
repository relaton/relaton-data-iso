    1.1    This document specifies the safety rules for permanently installed new passenger or goods passenger lifts, with traction, positive or hydraulic drive, serving defined landing levels, having a car designed for the transportation of persons or persons and goods, suspended by ropes, chains or jacks and moving between guide rails inclined not more than 15° to the vertical.
    1.2    In addition to the requirements of this document, supplementary requirements need to be considered in special cases (use of lifts by persons with disabilities, in case of fire, potentially explosive atmosphere, extreme climate conditions, seismic conditions, transporting dangerous goods, etc.).
    1.3    This document does not cover:
    a)    lifts with:
    b)    hydraulic lifts:
    c)    new passenger or goods passenger lifts in existing buildings[1] where, in some circumstances due to limitations enforced by building constraints, some requirements of this document cannot be met and local requirements, e.g., EN 81-21 need to be considered;
    d)    lifting appliances, such as paternosters, mine lifts, theatrical lifts, appliances with automatic caging, skips, lifts and hoists for building and public works sites, ships' hoists, platforms for exploration or drilling at sea, construction and maintenance appliances or lifts in wind turbines;
    e)    important modifications (see Annex C) to a lift installed before this document is brought into application;
    f)     safety during operations of transport, erection, repairs, and dismantling of lifts.
    However, this document can usefully be taken as a basis.
    Noise and vibrations are not dealt with in this document as they are not found at levels which could be considered harmful with regard to the safe use and maintenance of the lift (see also 0.4.2).
    1.4    This document is not applicable to passenger and goods passenger lifts, which are installed before the date of its publication.
    [1]   An existing building is a building which is used or was already used before the order for the lift was placed. A building whose internal structure is completely renewed is considered a new building.
