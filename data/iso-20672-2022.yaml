- content: |-
    This document specifies the construction, performance requirements, methods of testing and required test results for the rate of turn indicators required by Clause 2.9.1, Regulation 19, chapter V, SOLAS 1974 (as amended, 2000).
    It is based upon the requirements of IMO Resolution A.526(13), and is also associated with IMO Resolution A.694 (17) and IEC 60945.
    Where a requirement in this document is different from that in IEC 60945, the requirement in this document takes precedence.
    NOTE      All requirements that are extracted from the recommendations of IMO Resolution A.526(13) on performance standards for rate of turn indicators are printed in italics and the resolution and paragraph numbers are indicated in brackets.
