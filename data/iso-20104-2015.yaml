    ISO 20104:2015 is to provide a standard method for formally defining the digital information objects to be transferred by an information Producer to an Archive and for effectively packaging these objects in the form of Submission Information Packages (SIPs). This supports effective transfer and validation of SIP data.
    ISO 20104:2015 fits into the context defined by:
    ?         The Reference Model for an Open Archival Information System (OAIS) Recommended Standard (see reference [3]).
    ?         The Producer-Archive Interface Methodology Abstract Standard (PAIMAS) Recommended Standard (see reference [2]).
    ?         The XML Formatted Data Unit (XFDU) Structure and Construction Rules Recommended Standard (see reference [1]).
    The PAIMAS Recommended Standard (see reference [2]) defines a methodology based on the four following phases: Preliminary, Formal Definition, Transfer, Validation.
    ISO 20104:2015 applies specifically to the implementation of the main part of the Formal Definition Phase and the Transfer Phase, taking into account part of the Validation Phase.
    The proposed implementation should help in the automation and management of the Transfer and Validation Phases.
    The proposed implementation may also be used, to some extent, for the Preliminary Phase.
    ISO 20104:2015 does not exclude other PAIMAS implementation Recommended Standards.
