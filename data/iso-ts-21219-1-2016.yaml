    ISO/TS 21219-1:2016 defines an index to the complete set of TPEG Generation 2 toolkit components and applications. New applications are enumerated with an Application Identification (AID) as they are added to the TPEG applications family.
    ISO/TS 21219-1:2016 will be updated when such developments occur, to indicate the latest status and the inter-working of the various TPEG specifications. It will be issued as a new editorial version every time a new issue of any other specification is issued. Preliminary AIDs are allocated and managed by TISA and are listed on the TISA homepage www.tisa.org.
