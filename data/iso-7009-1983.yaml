abstract:
- content: Specifies the geometrical test for these woodworking moulding machines,
    and gives the corresponding permissible deviations which apply to machines for
    general purpose use and normal accuracy. Gives also the terminology appropriate
    to each part of the machine (in English, and French as well as the equivalent
    terms in German, Spanish, Italian and Swedish). It deals only with the verification
    of accuracy of the machine. It does not apply to the testing of the running of
    the machine, nor to machine characteristics which should generally be checked
    before the accuracy is tested. Does not impose any practical test.
