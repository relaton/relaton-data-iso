    ISO 11525-5:2015 defines user requirements for the interface between a non-slewing or slewing rough-terrain truck (hereafter referred to as truck) and an integrated work platform (hereafter referred to as integrated PWP).
    It is intended to achieve the following:
    a)   the prevention of personal injuries, property damage, and accidents;
    b)   the establishment of criteria for inspection, maintenance, operation, and training.
    NOTE          National or local requirements can apply, which could be more stringent.
