    ISO 10896-5:2015 defines design and safety requirements, and means for their verification, for the interface between a non-slewing or slewing variable-reach rough-terrain truck (hereafter referred to as "trucks") and an integrated personnel work platform (hereafter referred to as "integrated PWP").
    ISO 10896-5:2015 does not address the design or safety requirements related to the personnel work platform itself. These requirements are covered within national and international standards for mobile elevating work platforms.
    Personnel work platforms without control(s) that affect movement or mechanism(s), which interlock the platform to the truck, often referred to as non-integrated work platforms, are excluded from ISO 10896‑5:2015.
