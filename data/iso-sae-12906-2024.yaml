    This document specifies test procedures to determine the charging performance of electric vehicles. This document facilitates clear and consistent comparisons of realistic charging capabilities of electrically propelled vehicles (EVs) via commercially available electric vehicle supply equipment. It provides details about test conditions, test methods and test processes derived from typical use cases. Furthermore, it specifies requirements regarding the information for the vehicle operator.
    This document is applicable to EVs, including plug-in hybrid EVs.
    This document does not provide requirements for mopeds and motorcycles.
    Unless specified otherwise, all test procedures can be applied to AC, DC or wireless charging methods.
    NOTE            Specifications for reverse power transfer are under consideration.
