  content: Specifies the selective and mechanical sampling, conditioning of selected
    material and the preparation of test pieces. Selective method should be used in
    cases where the coefficients of variation of the wood properties for one tree
    and between trees of one species are known and selection is possible from a large
    number of trees, logs and pieces of sawn timber, and the mechanical method when
    the mean values of the above coefficients are known and selection is possible
    only from a limited number of trees, logs and pieces of sawn timber.
