- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: ISO 27368:2008 details analytical methods suitable for analysing the two
    primary toxic combustion gases, carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen cyanide (HCN),
    in blood samples collected from fire casualties. In blood, CO is measured as carboxyhaemoglobin
    (COHb) and HCN as cyanide ion (CN-). Although numerous methods are reported in
    the literature for performing blood COHb and CN- analyses, the analytical methods
    included herein are based upon their suitability for performing the analysis on
    ante-mortem and post-mortem blood samples from fire casualties. The analytical
    principle, analysis time, repeatability, reproducibility, robustness, effectiveness
    and instruments used are considered for those methods. Some of the methods described
    in ISO 27368:2008 might not be suitable for analysing putrid or clotted blood.
    Burned (solid) blood can be analysed after homogenization.
