  content: "1.1  Purpose  \nThis document provides a set of critical system of systems
    (SoS) considerations to be addressed at key points in the life cycle of the system
    of interest (SoI). This document refers to considerations that apply to an SoI
    that is a constituent system that interacts in an SoS. The considerations and
    life cycle model align with those which are already defined in ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288
    and ISO/IEC/IEEE 24748-1. Selected subsets of these considerations can be applied
    throughout the life of systems through the involvement of stakeholders. The ultimate
    goal is to achieve customer satisfaction, so that when delivered, the SoI will
    operate effectively in the operational or business environment which is typically
    characterized as one or more systems of systems.\nThis document concerns those
    systems that are man-made and are configured with one or more of the following:
    hardware, software, humans, procedures and facilities.\nThis document addresses
    SoS considerations that apply to systems at each stage of their respective life
    cycles.\nThere is a wide variety of systems in terms of their purpose, domain
    of application, complexity, size, novelty, adaptability, quantities, locations,
    life spans and evolution. This document is concerned with describing the system
    of systems considerations that apply to a system that is the SoI; that is a constituent
    system within a system of systems. It applies to one-of-a-kind systems, mass produced
    systems or customized, adaptable systems.\nThis document does not detail the approach
    to addressing system of systems considerations in terms of methods or procedures.\nThis
    document does not detail the described documentation in terms of name, format,
    explicit content and recording media of documentation."
