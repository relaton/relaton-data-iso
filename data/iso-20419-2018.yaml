abstract:
- content: "This document provides guidelines to planners and practitioners on how
    to adjust irrigation equipment so as to allow direct utilization of treated wastewater
    (TWW) for irrigation. It deals with the adjustment of all components of irrigation
    systems to TWW quality in respect to physical, chemical and biological parameters.\nThis
    document provides guidelines on how to protect irrigation equipment so as to guarantee
    water systems functionality at high levels of efficiency. \nThis document includes
    recommendations for\na)    pumping stations,\nb)    filtration,\nc)    water network
    systems,\nd)    irrigation equipment: emitters (drippers, sprinklers, mini sprinklers,
    micro sprinklers, sprayers and irrigation machine (sprinklers and sprayers),\ne)
    \   physical treatment of irrigation equipment, and\nf)     chemical treatment
    of irrigation equipment.\nThis document defines TWW parameters at the irrigation
    system inlet after a wastewater treatment plant, in order to allow optimal and
    continual functioning of the irrigation systems and to allow uniformity of emitters'
    discharge."
