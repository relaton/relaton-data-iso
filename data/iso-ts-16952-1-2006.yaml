- content: |-
    ISO/TS 16952-1:2006 establishes comprehensive and practice-oriented principles and rules for the designation of technical objects within a system, as well as for the designation of connections, signals and documents in accordance with the corresponding basic standards.
    The principles of ISO/TS 16952-1:2006 apply to all technical fields for all industries and can be applied in all phases of the life cycle of a technical object.
    ISO/TS 16952-1:2006 serves as the basis for sector-specific parts of ISO/TS 16952 and thus forms the connecting element between them and the basic IEC 61346 series.
    The designation of types, individuals, cost-centres, projects, etc. is not covered by ISO/TS 16952-1:2006.
