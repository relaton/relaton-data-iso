    SO 16602:2007 establishes minimum performance classification and labelling requirements for protective clothing designed to provide protection against chemicals. Protective clothing items covered by ISO 16602:2007 include, but may not be limited to, totally encapsulating suits, liquid-tight or spray-tight suits, coveralls, jackets, trousers, aprons, smocks, hoods, sleeves, and shoe and boot covers.
    Chemical protective clothing for protection against airborne particles is addressed by ISO 13982-1, which is referenced in ISO 16602:2007. ISO 16602:2007 does not address protection against solid chemicals in forms other than airborne solid particulates (e.g. it does not address the challenge of penetration of chemical dust and powders through materials and clothing by rubbing or flexing or by simple direct contact of dust or powders onto the clothing surface).
    ISO 16602:2007 does not address gloves, boots, eye/face protection devices and respiratory protective devices unless they are an integral part of the protective clothing. ISO 16602:2007 does not address protection against biological or thermal (hot or cold) hazards, ionizing radiation, or radioactive contamination. ISO 16602:2007 also does not address the specialized clothing used in hazardous chemical emergencies.
    ISO 16602:2007 is intended to provide chemical protective clothing manufacturers with minimum requirements for testing, classifying, and labelling chemical protective clothing. To assist the users of products covered under ISO 16602:2007, this document provides descriptions of referenced test methods, guidelines for conducting hazard and risk assessments and suggested performance levels for certain applications. It is not the intent of ISO 16602:2007 to address all situations.
