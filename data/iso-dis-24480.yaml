abstract:
- content: |-
    This document describes a practical procedure for nucleotide sequence database evaluation and validation. This document describes minimum requirements for the validation of a nucleotide sequence database. This document is applicable only for databases consisting of entries of nucleotide sequences.
    NOTE This document is not applicable to the general evaluation of the entire database quality including the quality of each data entry.
    EXAMPLE The use of the validated database is for confirming a representative sequence specificity including primers or probes for qualification and quantification of target nucleic acids by conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR), quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), digital polymerase chain reaction (dPCR) and microarray technologies.
