    ISO 16792:2015 specifies requirements for the preparation, revision, and presentation of digital product definition data, hereafter referred to as data sets. It supports two methods of application: model-only and model and drawing in digital format. Its structure presents requirements common to both methods followed by clauses providing for any essential, differing requirements for each method. Additionally, its use in conjunction with computer-aided design (CAD) systems could assist in the progression towards improved modelling and annotation practices for CAD and engineering disciplines, as well as serving as a guideline for IT engineers.
    The aspects specified in this International Standard refer mainly, but not exclusively, to requirements that differ or are additional to those provided in existing, related standards. Where no such requirements are identified, it is safe to assume that the appropriate existing ISO standards are instead applicable.
