  content: "ISO 15031-5:2011 is intended to satisfy the data reporting requirements
    of On-Board Diagnostic (OBD) regulations in the United States and Europe, and
    any other region that may adopt similar requirements in the future. ISO 15031-5:2011
    specifies: \n- message formats for request and response messages, \n- timing requirements
    between request messages from external test equipment and response messages from
    vehicles, and between those messages and subsequent request messages, \n- behaviour
    of both the vehicle and external test equipment if data is not available, \n-
    a set of diagnostic services, with corresponding content of request and response
    messages, to satisfy OBD regulations.\nISO 15031-5:2011 includes capabilities
    required to satisfy OBD requirements for multiple regions, model years, engine
    types, and vehicle types. Those regulations are not yet final for some regions,
    and are expected to change in the future. ISO 15031-5:2011 makes no attempt to
    interpret the regulations and does not include applicability of the included diagnostic
    services and data parameters for various vehicle applications. The user of ISO
    15031-5:2011 is responsible for verifying the applicability of each clause of
    ISO 15031-5:2011 for a specific vehicle, engine, model year and region.\nISO 15031-5:2011
    specifies diagnostic services and functionally addressed request/response messages
    required to be supported by motor vehicles and external test equipment for diagnostic
    purposes which pertain to motor vehicle emission-related data. Any external test
    equipment meeting the requirements of ISO 15031-4 use these messages to retrieve
    emissions-related information from the vehicle.\nEach clause in ISO 15031-5:2011
    which specifies additional details to existing sections of ISO 9141-2, ISO 14230-4,
    SAE J1850, and ISO 15765-4 supersede those specifications.\nISO 15031-5:2011 references
    SAE J1979-DA (Digital Annex), which includes all definitions of PIDs, OBDMIDs,
    TIDs and INFOTYPES. \nISO 15031-5:2011 provides the mechanism to satisfy the requirements
    included in the country-specific regulations and not all capabilities included
    in ISO 15031-5:2011 are required by the country-specific regulations. ISO 15031-5:2011
    is not considered a final authority for interpretation of the regulations. Therefore
    readers should determine the applicability of capabilities defined in ISO 15031-5:2011
    for their own specific needs."
