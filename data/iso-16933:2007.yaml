    ISO 16933:2006 provides a structured procedure to determine the air-blast resistance of glazing and sets forth the required apparatus, procedures, specimens, other requirements and guidelines for conducting arena air-blast tests of security glazing. Seven standard blasts simulating vehicle bombs and seven standard blasts simulating smaller satchel bombs that can be used to classify glazing performance are incorporated in this International Standard and cover a broad range of blast parameters.
    Security glazing, including that fabricated from glass, plastic glazing sheet material, glass-clad plastics, laminated glass, insulated glass, glass/plastic glazing materials and film-backed glass, can be tested and classified in a standard frame or tested but not classified in frames provided with the glazing.
    Classification and ratings are assigned based on the performance of glazing loaded by air-blast pressures and impulses and are specific to the blast characteristics under which the test takes place. Glazing that has received an air-blast classification and rating is suitable for use in blast-resistant applications only for blasts of comparable characteristics and only if installed in a properly designed frame. Design based on knowledge of the air-blast resistance reduces the risk of personal injury.
