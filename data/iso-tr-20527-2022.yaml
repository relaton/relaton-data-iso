abstract:
- content: |-
    This document presents methods to establish technical interoperability between the contactless interfaces of NFC mobile devices and those of public transport readers and customer media. It provides information on how to apply these for public transport fare management systems which are using ISO/IEC 14443 and/or ISO/IEC 18092 and/or EMV® Contactless Interface Specification[1] [9] as a basis for contactless communication.
    This document deals with the application of standards, specifications and certification schemes from other organizations and standards bodies. These organizations and standards bodies are solely responsible for the content and the maintenance of these standards, specifications and certification schemes.
    This document focuses on the technical interoperability of the contactless interfaces of NFC mobile devices and public transport devices. The goal is to reliably support communication and the exchange of data. Syntactic and semantic interoperability, i.e. the support for a particular public transport fare management application, is not covered by this document. However, practical experience shows that if technical interoperability is established successfully, the adoption of a specific public transport application can typically be achieved by loading the fare management system’s particular application software onto the NFC mobile device.
