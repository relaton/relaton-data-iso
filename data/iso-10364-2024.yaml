abstract:
- content: |-
    This document specifies methods for determining the pot life of multi-part adhesives, in order to be able to determine whether the pot life conforms to the minimum specified working life required of an adhesive.
    The different methods described in this document to measure the property do not necessarily provide identical results.
    The test methods described are suitable for assessing all multi–part adhesives, and especially epoxy based and polyurethane based adhesives, but they are not suitable for some acrylic-based adhesives.
    NOTE 1       Some of the methods described in this document can also be suitable for determination of working life of one-part adhesives that react to humidity (e.g. PUR prepolymers).
    NOTE 2       This document can also be used for assessing non-structural adhesives.
