abstract:
- content: IEC/TR 80001-2-4:2012(E), which is a technical report, provides guidance
    to help a healthcare delivery organization fulfilling its obligations as a responsible
    organization in the application of IEC 80001-1. A healthcare delivery organization
    includes hospitals, doctors' offices, community care homes and clinics. Specifically,
    this guide helps the healthcare delivery organization assess the impact of IEC
    80001-1 on the organization and establish a series of business as usual processes
    to manage RISK in the creation, maintenance and upkeep of its medical IT-networks.
    This technical report will be useful to those responsible for establishing an
    IEC 80001-1 compliant risk management framework within a healthcare delivery organization
    that is expecting to establish one or more medical IT-networks. It provides help
    through the key decisions and steps required to establish a risk management framework,
    before the organization embarks on a detailed risk assessment of an individual
    instance of a medical IT-network. The steps are supported by a series of decision
    points to steer the responsible organization through the process of understanding
    the medical IT-network context and identifying any organizational changes required
    to execute the responsibilities of top management.
