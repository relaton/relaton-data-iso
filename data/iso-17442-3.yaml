  content: This document specifies the use of the Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) code,
    represented in ISO 17442-1:2020 Financial services - Legal entity identifier (LEI)
    – Part 1 Assignment, in Authentic Chained Data Container credentials (ACDC credentials),
    represented by [reference to ACDC specification at the time of submission of this
    form 4, at a minimum to the IETF draft specification]. Leveraging standard cryptography
    combined with the chaining feature and strong authentication protocol, the Global
    Legal Entity Identifier Foundation (GLEIF) has designed and developed specific
    ACDC credentials containing LEIs and refers to these credentials as verifiable
    LEIs, or vLEIs. The goal of integrating LEIs in vLEI ACDC credentials is to combine
    the advantages of both. LEIs can provide unique identification of businesses (legal
    entities) and the cryptographic verification of identification associated with
    digital credentials. vLEIs provide automated remote verification of legal entities
    owning LEIs, i.e., cryptographically prove that an LEI is owned by the organization
    signing with or presenting the credential. vLEIs have been created both for the
    LEI legal entity level as well as for Role Credentials, vLEI credentials which
    in addition to containing the LEI, identify persons acting on behalf of a legal
    entity and the official or functional roles in which these persons represent the
    legal entity. Users can view the lists of entity level vLEIs as well as vLEI Role
    Credentials issued for legal entities to persons acting in official roles for
    the legal entity, which are called Legal Entity Official Organizational Role vLEI
    Credentials (OOR Credentials). Look up of this information is accessible in addition
    to the look up of each LEI code and its entity and relationship reference data
    provided in the Global LEI System for which GLEIF provides a GLEIF Application
    Programming Interface (API). OOR Credentials further leverage the ISO/TC 68 Subcommittee
    8 ISO 5009:2022 Financial services – Official Organizational Roles – Scheme for
    Official Organizational Roles standard. This standard specifies an unambiguous
    scheme to list official organizational roles by jurisdiction in a standard way,
    providing codes and their associated data records.
