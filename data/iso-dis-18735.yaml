  content: "This document specifies minimum requirements for high manganese austenitic
    steel castings for valves, flanges and other pressure-containing components for
    cryogenic temperature. \nThe specification of high manganese austenitic steel
    castings can be applicable to all pressure retaining components and any non-pressure
    retaining component.\nThe selection of high manganese austenitic steel castings
    for a specific service including any necessary additional material requirements
    remains the responsibility of the end user."
