    This document applies to electric and electronic systems and components for vehicles including electric propulsion systems and components with maximum working voltages according to voltage class B. It describes the potential environmental stresses and specifies tests and requirements for the specific mounting location on/in the vehicle.
    This document contains the terminology for the ISO 16750 series and general requirements.
    This document is not intended to apply to environmental requirements or testing for systems and components of motorcycles and mopeds. Electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) is not covered by this document.
    Systems and their components released for production, or systems and their components already under development prior to the publication date of this document, can be exempted from fulfilling the changes in this edition compared to the previous one.
