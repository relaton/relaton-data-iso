    All the requirements of this International Standard are generic and are intended to be applicable to any organization, regardless of its type or size, or the products and services it provides.
    NOTE 1    In this International Standard, the terms "product" or "service" only apply to products and services intended for, or required by, a customer.

    —         needs to demonstrate its ability to manage elections by secret ballot, to provide reliable, transparent, free and fair results that comply with electoral requirements;
    —         within the established legal framework, aims to enhance the trust and confidence of citizens, candidates, political organizations and other electoral interested parties through the effective implementation of the electoral quality management system, including processes for continual improvement.
    NOTE 3    Electoral bodies can be constituted to reflect local legal requirements.
    NOTE 4    In this document, the term "product" only applies to the electoral service provided by an electoral body.
