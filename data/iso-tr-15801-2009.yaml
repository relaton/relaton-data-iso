    ISO/TR 15801:2009 describes the implementation and operation of document management systems that can be considered to store electronic information in a trustworthy and reliable manner.
    ISO/TR 15801:2009 is for use by any organization that uses a document management system to store authentic, reliable and usable/readable electronic information over time. Such systems incorporate policies, procedures, technology and audit requirements that ensure that the integrity of the electronic information is maintained during storage.
    ISO/TR 15801:2009 does not cover processes used to evaluate whether information can be considered to be authentic prior to it being stored or imported into the system. However, it can be used to demonstrate that, once the information is stored, output from the system will be a true and accurate reproduction of the original.
