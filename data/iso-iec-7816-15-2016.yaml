abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 7816-15:2016 specifies an application in a card. This application
    contains information on cryptographic functionality. This part of ISO/IEC 7816
    defines a common syntax and format for the cryptographic information and mechanisms
    to share this information whenever appropriate. \nThe objectives of this part
    of ISO/IEC 7816 are to\n- -      facilitate interoperability among components
    running on various platforms (platform neutral),\n- -      enable applications
    in the outside world to take advantage of products and components from multiple
    manufacturers (vendor neutral),\n- -      enable the use of advances in technology
    without rewriting application-level software (application neutral), and\n- -      maintain
    consistency with existing, related standards while expanding upon them only where
    necessary and practical.\nIt supports the following capabilities:\n- -      storage
    of multiple instances of cryptographic information in a card;\n- -      use of
    the cryptographic information;\n- -      retrieval of the cryptographic information,
    a key factor for this is the notion of \"Directory Files\", which provides a layer
    of indirection between objects on the card and the actual format of these objects;\n-
    -      cross-referencing of the cryptographic information with DOs defined in
    other parts of ISO/IEC 7816 when appropriate; \n- -      different authentication
    mechanisms;\n- -      multiple cryptographic algorithms (the suitability of these
    is outside the scope of this part of ISO/IEC 7816).\nISO/IEC 7816-15.2016 does
    not cover the internal implementation within the card and/or the outside world.
    It is not mandatory for implementations complying with this International Standard
    to support all options described.\nIn case of discrepancies between ASN.1 definitions
    in the body of the text and the module in Annex A, Annex A takes precedence."
