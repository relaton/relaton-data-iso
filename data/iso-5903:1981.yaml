  content: Specifies principle, apparatus and procedure for a method for determination
    of the parameters mentioned above, in order to ensure that, for competitions and
    training, mats and surfaces for floor exercises are used, the hardness and impact
    damping of which lie in a specific range and to reduce the risk of injury to the
    gymnasts. The test method is based on the analysis of movement during landing
    and the evaluation of the energy level.
