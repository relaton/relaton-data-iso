    This document specifies safety, constructional, performance, testing and documentation requirements for gas pressure regulators for use in gas transmission and distribution installations (hereafter referred to as regulators).
    This document is applicable to regulators with operating pressures greater than 500 kPa and up to and including 10 MPa (100 bar) and nominal diameters up to DN 400 for use with fuel gases as natural gas, manufactured gas, biomethane or liquefied petroleum gas (LPG).
    This document is applicable to:
    —    test methods which are intended for product type test, routine tests and product surveillance tests;
    —    regulators which use the pipeline gas as a source of control energy unassisted by any external power source;
    —    regulators integrating on the same body a second regulator, used as monitor, complying with the requirements in this document;
    —    regulators integrating a safety shut off device (SSD) according to ISO 23555-3;
    —    regulators incorporating a creep (venting) relief device and/or a vent limiter complying with the requirements in this document.
    This document does not apply to:
    —    regulators upstream from/on/in domestic gas‑consuming appliances which are installed downstream of domestic gas meters;
    —    regulators designed to be incorporated into pressure control systems used in service lines (pipework from the main pipework in a gas infrastructure to the point of delivery of the gas) with declared volumetric flow rate ≤ 200 m3/h at normal conditions and declared inlet pressure ≤ 500 kPa (5 bar);
    —    industrial process control valves, such as IEC 60534 (all parts);
    —    regulators used in aggressive/sour gas environments (gas environments containing water and H2S are considered sour) or severely corrosive conditions;
    —    regulators in service conditions with renewables (e.g. H2NG with hydrogen more than 10 %) and/or waste gases (e.g. biogas etc.), if additional information is not provided (e. g. contaminant, liquid, etc.).
