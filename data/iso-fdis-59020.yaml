    This document specifies a framework for organizations to measure and assess circularity, enabling those organizations to contribute to sustainable development.
    The framework is applicable to multiple levels of an economic system, ranging from regional, inter-organizational, organizational to the product level.
    The framework provides guidance on how the circularity performance of an economic system can be objectively, comprehensively and reliably measured and assessed using circularity indicators and complementary methods. The framework can be used to determine the effectiveness of circular actions executed by public and private organizations. The purpose of the standard is to assist organizations in the collection of necessary information to enable circular economic practices that minimize resource use and/or enable a circular flow of resources and contribute to sustainable development.
    The framework can account for consideration of social, environmental and economic impacts when assessing circularity performance by allowing input from a variety of complementary methods.
