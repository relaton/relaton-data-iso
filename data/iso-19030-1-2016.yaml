abstract:
- content: |-
    ISO 19030-1:2016 outlines general principles for the measurement of changes in hull and propeller performance and defines a set of performance indicators for hull and propeller maintenance, repair and retrofit activities.
    The general principles outlined and performance indicators defined are applicable to all ship types driven by conventional fixed pitch propellers, where the objective is to compare the hull and propeller performance of the same ship to itself over time.
    NOTE          Support for additional configurations (e.g. variable pitch propellers) will, if justified, be included in later revisions of this document.
