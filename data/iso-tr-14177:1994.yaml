abstract:
- content: The primary purpose is to provide the basis for an improved information
    flow during the creation and use of facilities, and to give guidelines for organizing
    industry information. The recommendations are aimed at improving the information
    flow within particular countries and also from country to country. Is intended
    to be read in conjunction with a series of standards, each of which will define
    a recommended international classification table (e.g. for facilities, spaces,
    elements, construction products and attributes). Defines the underlying philosophy,
    the relationships between them, and the way in which, together, they will be an
    integrated whole.
