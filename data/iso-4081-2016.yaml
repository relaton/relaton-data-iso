abstract:
- content: ISO 4081:2016 specifies the requirements for straight or pre-formed rubber
    hoses and tubing for use in pressurized or unpressurized cooling circuits containing
    1,2-ethanediol-based coolants in internal-combustion engines for vehicles with
    an unladen mass (as defined in ISO 1176) of 3,5 t or less. In addition, this specification
    may also be applied as a classification system to enable original equipment manufacturers
    (OEMs) to detail a "line call-out" of tests for specific applications where these
    are not covered by the main types specified (see example in Annex D). In this
    case, the hose or tubing would not carry any marking showing this ISO specification
    number but may detail the OEM's own identification markings as shown on their
    part drawings.
