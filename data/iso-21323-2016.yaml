  script: Latn
  content: "ISO 21323:2016 is designed to be applicable to any kind of space mission
    or infrastructure that is communication-resource poor and is subject to long latencies
    and/or temporary network partitions, regardless of complexity. It is intended
    that this Recommended Standard become a uniform standard among all CCSDS Agencies.
    \ In addition, this specification exists to utilize the underlying service of
    various internetworking protocols both onboard and in transit between ground and
    space-based assets. \nISO 21323:2016 is intended to be applied to all systems
    that claim conformance to the CCSDS Bundle Protocol.  It is agnostic to the choice
    of underlying transmission protocol in that BP can function over AOS, Space Packet,
    Proximity-1 Space Link Protocol, and various Internet and ground based protocols.
    \nThe CCSDS believes it is important to document the rationale underlying the
    recommendations chosen, so that future evaluations of proposed changes or improvements
    will not lose sight of previous decisions. The concept and rationale for the use
    of a bundle protocol in space links may be found in reference [H1]."
