    This document specifies a method to predict the dynamic forces generated by an active component on a receiving structure from measurement on a test bench.
    It sets out the requirements applicable to test benches and setup measurement conditions of dynamic forces: a criterion of validity of transfer functions measurements can be established for example.
    The objective is to evaluate noise and vibrations generated by active components mounted on receiving structures, including the possibility to optimise vibration isolators.
    It can be applied to different systems connected to a building, such as a compressor or a power generator, or to systems connected to a vehicle body, such as an engine powertrain or an electrical actuator, for example.
