abstract:
- content: "This document describes methods for measuring lateral resolution and sharpness
    in imaging surface chemical analysis. It applies to all methods of surface analysis
    which use a beam to analyse the chemical composition of surfaces under defined
    settings of an instrument. It applies to scanning instruments, where a finely
    focused beam is scanned over the sample in a preselected field of view, as well
    as to full field imaging instruments, where the field of view is simultaneously
    imaged by a broad beam, an imaging lens system and a pixelated detector. The methods
    for measuring lateral resolution and sharpness are\n—          the straight edge
    method;\n—          the narrow line method; \n—          the grating method.\nThis
    document applies to instruments and methods that provide information on layers
    with nanometre thicknesses and to surfaces with nanometre‐sized structures and
    individual nano‐objects."
