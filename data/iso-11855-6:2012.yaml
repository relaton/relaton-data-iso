    ISO 11855-6:2012 establishes guidelines on the control of embedded radiant heating and cooling systems. It specifies uniform requirements for the design and construction of heating and cooling floors, ceiling and wall structures to ensure that the heating/cooling systems are suited to the particular application. The requirements specified by ISO 11855-6:2012 are applicable only to the components of the heating/cooling systems and the elements which are part of the heating/cooling surface and which are installed due to the heating/cooling systems.
    The ISO 11855 series is applicable to water based embedded surface heating and cooling systems in residential, commercial and industrial buildings. The methods apply to systems integrated into the wall, floor or ceiling construction without any open air gaps. It is not applicable to panel systems with an open air gap which is not integrated with the building structure.
    The ISO 11855 series applies also, as appropriate, to the use of other fluids instead of water as heating or cooling medium. It is not applicable for testing of systems. The methods do not apply to heated or chilled ceiling panels or beams.
