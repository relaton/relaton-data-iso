abstract:
- content: This document defines the procedure executed by a Member of a distributed
    inter-process communication (IPC) facility (DIF) or distributed application facility
    (DAF) to initialize a New Member as a fully functioning Member. This procedure
    is used when it is likely the new Member has not previously been a Member of the
    DIF or DAF in the near past. This document is defined for use with DIFs, but can
    be used equally well by a DAF that wants to assign synonyms with a scope limited
    to the DAF.
