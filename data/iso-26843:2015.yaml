    ISO 26843:205 specifies requirements for performing and evaluating instrumented precracked Charpy impact tests on metallic materials using a fracture mechanics approach. Minimum requirements are given for measurement and recording equipment such that similar sensitivity and comparable measurements are achieved.
    Dynamic fracture mechanics properties determined using this International Standard are comparable with conventional large-scale fracture mechanics results when the corresponding validity criteria are met. Because of the small absolute size of the Charpy specimen, this is often not the case. Nevertheless, the values obtained can be used in research and development of materials, in quality control, and to establish the variation of properties with test temperature under impact loading rates.
    Fracture toughness properties determined through the use of this International Standard may differ from values measured at quasistatic loading rates. Indeed, an increase in loading rate causes a decrease in fracture toughness when tests are performed in the brittle or ductile-to-brittle regimes; the opposite is observed (i.e. increase in fracture toughness) in the fully ductile regime. More information on the dependence of fracture toughness on loading (or strain) rate is given in Reference [1]. In addition, it is generally acknowledged that fracture toughness also depends on test temperature. For these reasons, the user is required to report the actual test temperature and loading rate for each test performed.
    In case of cleavage fracture of ferritic steels in the ductile-to-brittle transition region, variability can be very large and cannot be adequately described by simple statistics. In this case, additional tests are required and the analysis is to be performed using a statistical procedure applicable to this type of test, see for example Reference [2].
    NOTE          Modifications to the analytical procedures prescribed in Reference [2] might be necessary to account for the effect of elevated (impact) loading rates.
