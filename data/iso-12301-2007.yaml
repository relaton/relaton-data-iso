- content: 'ISO 12301:2007 specifies quality control techniques and inspection of
    the geometrical and material quality characteristics of the following types of
    plain bearings: thin-walled half-bearings with or without flange, as specified
    in ISO 3548; metallic thick-walled half-bearings (with and without flange) that
    are manufactured as halves but that are necessarily interchangeable and have the
    ratio s3 : Do > 0,11; wrapped bushes, as specified in ISO 3547; unsplit metallic
    bushes (with and without flange) made from solid and multilayer materials and
    with outside diameters up to 230 mm; solid polymer bushes (with and without flange)
    with inside diameters up to 200 mm; ring-type thrust washers and pressed bimetallic
    half-thrust washers, as specified in ISO 6525 and ISO 6526, respectively; and
    bushes made from sintered material, as specified in ISO 2795.'
