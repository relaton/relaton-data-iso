  content: "ISO/IEC 29341-26-16:2017 is compliant with the [1]. It defines a service
    type referred to herein as Presence service. \nThe Presence service is a UPnP
    service that allows control points, or better known as Telephony Control Points
    (TelCP), to manage presence information through a Telephony Server (TS) device
    or a Telephony Client (TC) device (in the role of UPnP server device for Presence
    service). This service provides control points with the following functionality:\n-
    \          Presence of contacts, access the presence information of contacts,
    as provided by the UPnP Telephony Server device. Contacts referenced by the Presence
    service may be managed via PhoneManagement service and the Phone Data Model.\n-
    \          Managing presence information, update the presence status stored in
    the TS;\nThis service does not provide the following functionality:\n-           To
    update the presence status of the local UPnP network, from the UPnP server device
    to remote presence servers (i.e. outside the local UPnP network).\n-           To
    retrieve the presence information of contacts from remote presence servers (i.e.
    outside the local UPnP network).\nWhen the features provided by the Presence service
    are associated to the PhoneManagement features, then an integrated management
    of the address book and the presence of contacts in the address book can be delivered."
