    ISO/TS 17263:2003 establishes an AEI-System based on radio frequency technologies. This system is intended for general application in RTTT/TICS. It allows for the transfer of the identification codes and further information about equipment and vehicles used in intermodal transport into such RTTT/TICS and information systems related to Intermodal Transport processes. Within the intermodal context of the RTTT/TICS Sector, AEI systems have the specific objective of achieving an unambiguous identification of an ITU or related equipment or vehicle or item used in intermodal transport, and to make that identification automatically. Vehicles will be considered and handled under Intermodal aspects as "Intermodal Equipment". Therefore a differentiation between AEI and AVI systems under the purpose of ISO/TS 17263:2003 is not required.
    ISO/TS 17263:2003 is specifically aimed at DSRC-type air interfaces. The requirement and test methods may not apply for Intermodal AEI systems using long range communications such as Cellular Networks or Satellite, or vicinity communication such as inductively coupled antennas. The interoperability across the air interface (reference point Delta) is outside the scope of ISO/TS 17263:2003.
    The aim of ISO/TS 17263:2003 is to define, describe and specify the System Parameters related to an intermodal AEI system to provide an enabling Standard, which, whilst allowing the system specifier to determine the performance levels and operating conditions, provides a framework for interoperability. Therefore ISO/TS 17263:2003 specifies:
    - parameters and requirements of the identification system itself;
    - performance criteria necessary to ensure consistent and reliable operation of AEI systems within international transport processing;
    - requirements of the performance and the position of the electronic devices (tag) when installed on intermodal equipment;
    - requirements for the installation of readers, and performance data related to these components.
