  script: Latn
  content: This document defines safety-related properties and risk factors impacting
    the insufficient performance and malfunctioning behaviour of Artificial Intelligence
    (AI) within a road vehicle context. It describes a framework that addresses all
    phases of the development and deployment lifecycle. This includes the derivation
    of suitable safety requirements on the function, considerations related to data
    quality and completeness, architectural measures for the control and mitigation
    of failures, tools used to support AI, verification and validation techniques
    as well as the evidence required to support an assurance argument for the overall
    safety of the system.
