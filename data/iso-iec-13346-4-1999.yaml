    ISO/IEC 13346 specifies a format and associated system requirements for volume and boot block recognition,
    volume structure, file structure and record structure for the interchange of information on media between users of
    information processing systems.
    The media shall be recorded as if the recording of sectors may be done in any order.
    Note 1 - The medium is not restricted to being of only one type; the type of medium may be either write once, or read only, or rewritable, or a
    combination of these types.
    This International Standard consists of the following five Parts:
    Part 1: General
    Part 2: Volume and Boot Block Recognition
    Part 3: Volume Structure
    Part 4: File Structure
    Part 5: Record Structure
    Annex A - ICB Strategies, is part of this part of ISO/IEC 13346.
    This part of ISO/IEC 13346 specifies a format and associated system requirements for file structure by specifying:
    -  the placement of files;
    -  the attributes of the files;
    -  the relationship among files of a logical volume;
    -  levels of medium interchange;
    -  requirements for the processes which are provided within information processing systems, to enable information
    to be interchanged between different systems; for this purpose, it specifies the functions to be provided within
    systems which are intended to originate or receive media which conform to this part of ISO/IEC 13346.
