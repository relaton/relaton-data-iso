abstract:
- content: "ISO 16840-4:2009 specifies test methods and requirements for design and
    performance, for instructions and warnings and for product marking and labelling
    of seating systems intended to be used as a forward-facing seat in a motor vehicle
    when fitted to a manual or powered wheelchair. It evaluates the frontal crashworthiness
    performance of complete seating systems for occupancy by adults or children of
    mass equal to or greater than 22 kg.\nISO 16840-4:2009 only applies to complete
    wheelchair seating systems including attachment hardware, designed to be used
    with a wheelchair base tested as part of a wheelchair system that conforms to
    ISO 7176-19 performance requirements and that has securement points for use with
    four-point, strap-type tiedowns.\nISO 16840-4:2009 applies to seating systems
    designed to be used with occupant restraints that anchor either to the vehicle,
    the tiedown system, the seating system or the wheelchair base. "
