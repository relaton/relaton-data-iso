- content: The different approaches to the drafting of International Standards resulted
    in a lack of uniformity in the technical content, and in the layout and sequence
    of the subject matter, of such documents. This Technical Report has, therefore,
    been prepared to create guidelines for the presentation of International Standards
    dealing with the design of structures.
