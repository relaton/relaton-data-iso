  content: ISO 11711-1:2013 provides guidance to shipboard personnel and other concerned
    parties on the materials, design, and installation of equipment used to take samples
    of treated ballast water from the ballast water discharge pipe onboard a vessel.
    The purpose of the sampling system is to enable the taking of a representative
    sample in order to verify that the ballast water management system (BWMS) is working
    as designed, i.e. the treatment is reducing the concentration of living organisms
    to levels established in discharge standards. The intent of the sampling installation
    is to provide a representative sample of the ballast water effluent with adequate
    pressure and flow.
