abstract:
- content: 'This new work item proposal specifies a routine method for determination
    of volatile basic nitrogen in meat and fish products: semi-micro nitrogen determination
    method. In this method, the test sample is deproteinised by a solution of trichloracetic
    acid. Then the extract is put into the apparatus for steam distillation. As volatile
    basic nitrogen is volatile, steam distillation makes volatile basic nitrogen of
    the extract easily produce in the process of alkalinisation. The volatile nitrogenous
    base components are then absorbed by an acid receiver. Finally, the volatile basic
    nitrogen concentration is determined by acid-base titration of the absorbed bases.
    This proposed new work item proposal is applicable to the determination of volatile
    basic nitrogen in food with meat and fish as the main raw materials, including
    livestock, poultry, egg and fish products.'
