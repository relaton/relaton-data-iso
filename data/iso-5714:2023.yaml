    This document provides testing methods to evaluate the energy performance, emissions, safety and durability of institutional cookstoves. For general guidance (not a requirement), institutional cookstoves typically have firepower greater than 10 kW and/or cooking vessel volume greater than 25 l. The evaluation of household cookstoves is covered in ISO19867-1 and ISO19869 and is not addressed in this document.
    This document provides the following:
    —     quantitative and qualitative measurements of performance and safety of institutional cookstoves – methods include uncontrolled and controlled cooking tests;
    —     guidance for the measurement of air pollution, and;
    —     guidance for prioritizing measurements that balance comprehensiveness and feasibility.
    This document includes testing methods for energy performance, emissions and durability that are applicable to institutional cookstoves that burn solid, liquid, and gaseous fuels and for energy performance, safety and durability that are applicable to institutional cookstoves powered by solar thermal energy.
    Safety testing methods are applicable to institutional solar cookstoves and cookstoves that burn solid fuels and are not applicable to cookstoves that burn liquid or gaseous fuels, such as LPG (liquefied petroleum gas), alcohol, plant oil or kerosene. Safety evaluation of gas-fuelled cookstoves can be found in ISO 23550 and the ISO 23551 series. Safety evaluation of liquid-fuelled cookstoves is not found in existing ISO standards. This document is not applicable to electric cookstoves.
