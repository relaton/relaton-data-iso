  content: "ISO/IEC 11889-1:2015 defines the architectural elements of the Trusted
    Platform Module (TPM), a device which enables trust in computing platforms in
    general.  Some TPM concepts are explained adequately in the context of the TPM
    itself.  Other TPM concepts are explained in the context of how a TPM helps establish
    trust in a computing platform. When describing how a TPM helps establish trust
    in a computing platform, ISO/IEC 11889-1:2015 provides some guidance for platform
    requirements. However, the scope of ISO/IEC 11889 is limited to TPM requirements.
    \nISO/IEC 11889-1:2015 illustrates TPM security and privacy techniques in the
    context of a platform through the use of cryptography. It includes definitions
    of how different cryptographic techniques are implemented by a TPM. The scope
    of ISO/IEC 11889 does not include cryptographic analysis or guidance about the
    applicability of different algorithms for specific uses cases.\nTPM requirements
    in ISO/IEC 11889-1:2015 are general, covering concepts like integrity protection,
    isolation and confidentially.  Defining a specific strength of function or assurance
    level is out of scope for ISO/IEC 11889. This approach limits the guarantees provided
    by ISO/IEC 11889 itself, but it does allow the TPM architectural elements defined
    to be adapted to meet diverse implementation and platform specific needs. "
