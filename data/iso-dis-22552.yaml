  content: "This document provides general requirements of Manufacturing Readiness
    Review (MRR), for space products, sometimes termed Production Readiness Review,
    including initiate process, implement process, conclude process and closed-loop
    process of MRR. \n\nThe Manufacturing Readiness Review (MRR) is a formal examination
    to determine if the design (of product definition and requirements, manufacturing
    documentation, processes, personnel, materials and parts, facilities, etc.) is
    ready for production.\n\nDepending on the space system, the objectives of MRR
    could be performed through other existing reviews named differently and within
    the project/programme. The MRR could be repeated during the production phase.\n\nThe
    typical programme milestone (phase ending) to operate MRR is detailed design stage
    during or at the end of development phase. The typical milestone criteria are
    the completion of production plan.\n\nThis document is applicable to Manufacturing
    Readiness Review management."
