    ISO 13105-2:2014 specifies safety requirements for machines used for concrete surface floating and finishing. This includes pedestrian-controlled equipment and ride-on equipment. It is not applicable to    internal or external vibrators or ancillary equipment used with internal and external vibrators, for example, air compressors, hydraulic power sources, and voltage transformers, to remote-controlled or hand-held smoothing machines and self-acting (robotic) smoothing machines, or to strike-off type machines commonly known as screeds.
    It deals with significant hazards, hazardous situations, or hazardous events relevant to machinery for concrete surface floating and finishing (power trowels) when used as intended and under conditions of misuse which are reasonably foreseeable by the manufacturer.
    It is not applicable to machines which are manufactured before the date of its publication.
