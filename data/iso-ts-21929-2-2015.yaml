- content: |-
    ISO/TS 21929-2:2015 establishes a list of aspects and impacts which should be taken as the basis for the development of sustainability indicators for assessing the sustainability performance of new or existing civil engineering works, related to their design, construction, operation, maintenance, refurbishment and end-of-life. Together, the indicators developed from this list of aspects and impacts provide measures to express the contribution of a civil engineering works to sustainability and sustainable development. The developed indicators should represent aspects of civil engineering works that impact on issues of concern related to sustainability and sustainable development.
    The object of consideration in ISO/TS 21929-2:2015 is a civil engineering works, a part of the civil engineering works or a combination of several civil engineering works.
