- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: ISO 22029:2012 presents a simple format for the exchange of digital spectral
    data that has been designated as an EMSA/MAS standard. This format is readable
    by both humans and computers and is suitable for transmission through various
    electronic networks, the phone system (with modems) or on physical computer storage
    devices (such as removable media). The format is not tied to any one computer,
    programming language or computer operating system. The adoption of a standard
    format would enable different laboratories to freely exchange spectral data, and
    would help to standardize data analysis software. If equipment manufacturers were
    to support a common format, the microscopy and microanalysis community would avoid
    duplicated effort in writing data analysis software.
