    ISO/TR 11225:2012 provides guidelines for selected reference and standard atmospheric models for use in engineering design or scientific research. It describes the content of the models, uncertainties and limitations, technical basis, databases from which the models are formed, publication references, and sources of computer code where available for over seventy (70) Earth and planetary atmospheric models, for altitudes from surface to 4 000 km, which are generally recognized in the aerospace sciences. ISO/TR 11225:2012 is intended to assist aircraft and space vehicle designers and developers, geophysicists, meteorologists, and climatologists in understanding available models, comparing sources of data, and interpreting engineering and scientific results based on different atmospheric models.
    ISO/TR 11225:2012 summarizes the principal features of the models to the extent the information is available:
    - model content;
    - model uncertainties and limitations;
    - basis of the model;
    - publication references;
    - dates of development, authors and sponsors;
    - model codes and sources.
