    This document describes a procedure determination of the anti-aging aspects of turbine control fluids used in the turbine speed control system of power generation enterprises.
    This test method applies to triaryl phosphate ester turbine control fluids as well as fire-resistant liquids. The anti-aging test of other ester oils can be carried out by this document but precision thereof has not been determined.
