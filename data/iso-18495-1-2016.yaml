    ISO 18495-1:2016 establishes a framework and architecture for data collection and to provide data definitions for visibility of vehicles, self-propelled construction machinery and agricultural equipment (hereinafter referred to as "automotives" or "automobiles") in the distribution supply chain between a point of origin (start of logistics movement) and an intended destination.
    This architecture is designed to cover any undocumented movements at any location. The scope of this part of ISO 18495 is to
    a)    enable dynamic location within a storage area/compound,
    b)    provide consistent use of the ISO 3779/ ISO 3780 VIN (where available) as the prime identifier, and
    c)    where a VIN is not available, provide consistent and standardized identification throughout the distribution chain movement.
