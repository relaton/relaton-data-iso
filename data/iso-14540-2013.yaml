  content: "ISO 14540:2013 specifies dimensional and performance requirements for
    \nhydraulic screw-to-connect quick-action couplings designed to be used at \npressure
    of 72 MPa (720 bar) in static conditions as an interface between a \nhydraulic
    power unit and a tool. Typical applications for these couplings are \nrelated
    to hydraulic jacks, rams, clamping devices, hand tools, and \ncylinders.\nISO
    14540:2013 covers two types of such couplings: the \"P\" type, which has a \npoppet
    valve, and the \"S\" type, which has a spherical valve."
