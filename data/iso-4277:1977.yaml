  content: Applicable to products having contents of AlF3 of more than 0.15 % (m/m)
    or of NaF of more than 0.4 % (m/m). Covers sintering of a test portion with a
    known quantity of sodium fluoride in a muffle furnace at a temperature of (790
    10) °C. Under these conditions, aluminium fluoride in excess of that required
    by the stoichiometric formula AlF3 .3NaF reacts to form cryolite; extraction of
    the ground sintered mass with boiling water. Acidification with hydrochloric acid
    solution to a pH less than 3.7 and titration of the excess sodium fluoride with
    thorium nitrate solution in the presence of alizarin-S as indicator. Has also
    been approved by the IUPAC.
