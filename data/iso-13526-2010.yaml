    ISO 13526:2010 specifies a standard message format for use in exchanging spacecraft tracking data between space agencies. Such exchanges are used for distributing tracking data output from routine interagency cross-supports, in which spacecraft missions managed by one agency are tracked from a ground station managed by a second agency. The standardization of tracking data formats facilitates space agency allocation of tracking sessions to alternate tracking resources.
    ISO 13526:2010 includes requirements and criteria that the message format has been designed to meet. For exchanges where these requirements do not capture the needs of the participating agencies, another mechanism can be selected.
