  script: Latn
  content: "The proposed deliverable specifies the basic principles and methodology
    to be used to recognize personal data written in free text in different languages
    and countries.\nThe applications are essentially for protecting human data circulating
    in national and international industries, and private and public organizations.
    \nThe principles of data protection should apply to any information concerning
    an identified or identifiable natural person. An identifiable natural person is
    one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular for the proposed
    standard by reference to an identifier such as, for example, a name, an identification
    number, a bank account number, location data such as residence address, an online
    identifier.  Excluded from this standard are factors specific to the physical,
    physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that
    natural person. \nThe proposed deliverable which is directed to processing by
    human beings and/or automated processing is also applicable to different domains
    (for example: law, finance, health, etc.)  but excludes automated image processing."
