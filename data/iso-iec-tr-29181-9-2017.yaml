    ISO/IEC TR 29189-9:2017 describes the general characteristics of Networking of Everything (NoE), which can be applied to Future Networks, especially from an Internet of Things (IoT) perspective. This document specifies:
    -      a conceptual model of NoE and its definition;
    -      problem statements in conventional networking;
    -      standardization activities of other standards-development organizations;
    -      requirements for NoE from an IoT perspective;
    -      technical aspects.
    NOTE:         Since networking issues are an integral part of IoT and Future Networks, while standards of IoT or Future Networks are under development in other standards-development organizations, this document focuses on networking issues to integrate diverse networking techniques to provide users' service and/or things requirement.
