    This document specifies the general principles, assumptions and preconditions for the calculation of multi-lobed and tilting-pad journal bearings by means of an easy-to-use calculation procedure based on numerous simplifying assumptions. For a reliable evaluation of the results of this calculation method, it is indispensable to consider the physical implications of these assumptions as well as practical experiences for instance from temperature measurements carried out on real machinery under typical operating conditions. Applied in this sense, this document presents a simple way to predict the approximate performance of plain journal bearings for those unable to access more complex and accurate calculation techniques.
    The calculation method serves for the design and optimisation of plain bearings, for example in turbines, compressors, generators, electric motors, gears and pumps. It is restricted to steady-state operation, i.e. in continuous operating states the load according to size and direction and the angular velocity of the rotor are constant.
    Unsteady operating states are not recorded. The stiffness and damping coefficients of the plain journal bearings required for the linear vibration and stability investigations are indicated in ISO/TS 31657-2 and ISO/TS 31657-3.
