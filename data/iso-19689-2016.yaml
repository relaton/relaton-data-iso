    ISO 19689:2016 specifies a minimum set of requirements for a diagnostic connector used in communication between motorcycles and mopeds, and external equipment for diagnostics. Its aim is to promote the use of a common diagnostic connector throughout the motorcycle industry. The diagnostic connection consists of two mating connectors, the vehicle connector and the external test equipment connector. Applicable to all types of motorcycles and mopeds, the connector specified is sealed with positive locking feature and is intended for short-term diagnostic connection only.
    ISO 19689:2016 specifies functional requirements for
    a)    the vehicle connector, separated into the four principal areas of
    - -      connector location,
    - -      connector design,
    - -      connector contact allocation, and
    - -      electrical requirements for connector and related electrical circuits, and
    b)    the external test equipment connector, separated into the three principal areas of
    - -      connector design,
    - -      connector contact allocation, and
    - -      electrical requirements for connector and related electrical circuits.
    The dimensional requirements of the vehicle connector are given as a minimum specification, to allow design freedom.
