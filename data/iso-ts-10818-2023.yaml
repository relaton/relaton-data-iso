    This document specifies the characteristics and performance(s) of the superhydrophobic textiles containing nanomaterials and nanostructures (TCNNs) based on contact angle measurement before and after being subjected to washing/drying (laundry), ironing processes, light sources and abrasion, that are to be determined by agreement between customer and supplier. This document solely covers woven and nonwoven fabrics.
    This document does not address safety and health related issues.
