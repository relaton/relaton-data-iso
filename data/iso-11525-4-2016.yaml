    ISO 11525-4:2016, when used in conjunction with ISO 11525‑1 or ISO 11525‑2, defines specific user requirements relating to the use of non-slewing and slewing variable-reach trucks operating with freely suspended loads.
    When provisions of this part of ISO 11525 are different from those which are stated in ISO 11525‑1 or ISO 11525‑2, the provisions of this part of ISO 11525 take precedence over the provisions of ISO 11525‑1 or ISO 11525‑2.
    It is intended to achieve the following:
    a)   prevention of personal injuries, property damage and accidents;
    b)   establishment of criteria for inspection, maintenance, operation and training.
    NOTE          National or local requirements can apply, whichever could be more stringent.
    General user requirements for non-slewing variable-reach trucks are given in ISO 11525‑1.
    General user requirements for slewing variable-reach trucks are given in ISO 11525‑2.
    ISO 11525-4:2016 is not applicable to flexible intermediate bulk containers as defined in ISO 21898.
