    ISO/TR 17784:2003 contains general information on rubber and plastic hoses with regard to both their properties and their practical application. This includes, amongst other things, the properties of materials used in hoses, the precautions to be taken when storing hoses and the care required when installing and fitting hoses and their couplings. Safety measures when testing hoses are also indicated. This Technical Report is intended for use by system designers, purchasers, assemblers, installers and operating personnel to improve the operating safety of hoses and hose assemblies.
    NOTE Metal hoses are not included in this Technical Report. Attention is drawn to the following International Standards: ISO 8444, ISO 8445, ISO 8446, ISO 8447, ISO 8448, ISO 8449, ISO 8450, ISO 10807, ISO 10806 and ISO 10380.
    This Technical Report cannot, in practice, cover all circumstances and therefore its content is largely based on examples. It is assumed that these examples will provide sufficient information to give guidelines for a range of practical circumstances.
