  content: "This document specifies definitions and general requirements for cell
    viability analytical methods. It provides general considerations for selecting
    and establishing fit-for-purpose cell viability analytical methods. It also provides
    considerations for managing sources of variability for cell viability measurements
    during pre-analytical, analytical, and post-analytical phases.\nThis document
    is applicable to cells in suspension, cells adhered to a substrate, and cells
    in complex matrices. \nThis document is primarily applicable to cell viability
    measurements of nucleated mammalian cells.\nSeveral sector/application-specific
    international and national standards for cell viability currently exist.  When
    applicable, the user can consult existing standards when operating with their
    scope."
