  content: This document defines how to access Resources on a Web services interface
    of an Offering Party using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS). For
    such an access, the Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural pattern
    is chosen as a common way to format Resource paths. Some specific extensions to
    this pattern are defined to allow for asynchronous Resource requests, such as,
    for example, forcing readouts of data from a connected vehicle.
