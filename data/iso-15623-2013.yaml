abstract:
- content: ISO 15623:2013 specifies performance requirements and test procedures for
    systems capable of warning the driver of a potential rear-end collision with other
    vehicles ahead of the subject vehicle while it is operating at ordinary speed.
    The FVCWS operate in specified subject vehicle speed range, road curvature range
    and target vehicle types. ISO 15623:2013 covers operations on roads with curve
    radii over 125 m, and motor vehicle including cars, trucks, buses, and motorcycles.
    Responsibility for the safe operation of the vehicle remains with the driver.
