  content: Due to the large paper size and poor print quality, the use of high reduction
    ratios for microfilming newspaper on A6 microfiches is usually not recommended.
    Since, however, press cuttings are smaller than full-page newspaper, they can
    be filmed at lower reduction ratio. It is advantageous to microfilm press cuttings
    on microfiche whose different grid patterns allow filming of originals of different
    sizes. specified are the particular aspects of microfilming press cuttings an
    A6 microfiche.
