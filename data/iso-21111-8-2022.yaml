abstract:
- content: |-
    This document defines various parameters to be tested for the communication channel between two Ethernet devices (e.g. ECUs for automotive application) and also for the transmission media including cables and connectors as a single component of which the communication channel consists. This document also specifies the general RF requirements for a physical layer communication channel for ISO/IEC/IEEE 8802-3. These requirements are related to signal integrity of the communication channel.
    Test methods for electrical performances of the communication channel/link and cables and connectors are also specified in this document.
