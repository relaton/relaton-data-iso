  content: The determination method applies to plasticized cellulose acetate in any
    form, such as moulding material, sheet, manufactured articles. Conversion of the
    plastizised sample to a film, prepared by dissolving and casting, and subsequent
    extraction by ethylether in a Soxhlet apparatus. Removal of the ether by heating
    under vacuum and weighing the residual matter.
