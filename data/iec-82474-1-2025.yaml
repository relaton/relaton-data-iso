- content: |-
    IEC/ISO dual logo IEC 82474-1:2025 specifies the requirements and guidance for the content, format and exchange relating to material declarations for products.
    The main intended use of this document is to provide data up and down the supply chain that:
    - allows organizations to assess products against material and substance requirements,
    - allows organizations to assess process chemical substances used in manufacturing and other stages of the product life,
    - allows organizations to use this information in their activities related to environmentally conscious design process and across all product life cycle stages,
    - allows organisations to obtain information about material efficiency and circularity of their products.
    This document specifies mandatory declaration requirements and also provides optional declaration requirements.
    This document does not suggest any specific software solution to capture material declaration data in the supply chain. However, it provides a data format used to transfer information within the supply chain. Organizations can determine the most appropriate method to capture material declaration data without compromising data utility and quality. This document is intended to allow declaration based on engineering judgement, responder (supplier) material declarations, and/or sampling and testing.
    This document has the status of a horizontal publication in accordance with IEC Guide 123.
    This edition includes the following technical changes with respect to IEC 62474:2018 (edition 2):
    a) Definitions were sharpened to fulfil needs from sectors other than electrical and electronic products and systems and new terms have been added that support new topics introduced such as webservice methods, material efficiency and circularity, and new reference list types.
    b) A new subclause (4.6) covering process chemical declaration was included. This subclause covers requirements related to the information required about process chemical substances, the applicable processes where they are used, and the respective product life cycle phase(s).
    c) A new clause (8) covering web services on material declaration was included. This clause covers requirements related to topics such as machine-machine communication, authentication service, and data representation.
    d) Requirements and guidance for the development of reference lists such as query list (QL), and application/exemption lists (AL/EL) were included.
    This document has been given the status of a horizontal document in accordance with ISO/IEC Directives, Part 1. It is published as a double logo standard.
