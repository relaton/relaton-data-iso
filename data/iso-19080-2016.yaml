abstract:
- content: |-
    ISO 19080:2016 describes the CoAP facilities between two or more ITS stations communicating over the global internet communication network.
    It is assumed that the reader is familiar with IETF specifications found in request for comments (RFCs) of individual CoAP and 6LoWPAN protocol blocks used within this document. This document does not define a new protocol, a new exchange of messages at the CoAP layer, or new data structures. It defines how protocols standardized by IETF are combined so that ITS stations can communicate with one another using CoAP. Procedures defined to share information between the CoAP layer and other components of the ITS station architecture are defined in ISO 24102 series (Management). In addition to the requirements specified within this document, a number of notes and examples are provided to illustrate CoAP main facilities.
