abstract:
- content: |-
    This document introduces basic common underlying concepts related to driver performance and state in the context of automated driving. The concepts in this document are applicable to all levels of automated driving functions that require a human/driver to be engaged or fallback-ready (SAE level 1, 2 and 3). It can also be used with levels that enable a driver to resume manual control of the vehicle (a compatible feature for SAE levels 1 to 5).
    Common underlying concepts can be applicable for human factors assessment/evaluations using driving simulators, tests on restricted roadways (e.g. test tracks) or tests on public roads. The information applies to all vehicle categories.
    This document contains a mixture of information where technical consensus supports such guidance, as well as discussion of those areas where further research is required to support technical consensus. These common underlying concepts can be also useful for product descriptions and owner manuals. The contents in this document are informative, rather than normative, in nature.
