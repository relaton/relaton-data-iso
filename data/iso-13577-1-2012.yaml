    ISO 13577-1:2012 specifies the general safety requirements common to industrial furnaces and associated processing equipment (TPE). It details significant hazards associated with TPE, and specifies the appropriate preventive measures for reduction or elimination of these hazards.
    ISO 13577-1:2012 gives general principles and general safety requirements for the reduction of risks associated with TPE.
    It is not applicable to the risks associated with quenching, vacuums, salt baths, liquid phase treatment and protective or reactive atmospheres.
    ISO 13577-1:2012 specifies the safety requirements at stages in the life of the equipment, and its design, ordering, construction, use and disposal. It specifies safety requirements for maintenance, provision for indicators and inspection. It deals with the significant hazards, hazardous situations or hazardous events relevant to the equipment, when it is used as intended and under conditions of misuse which are reasonably foreseeable by the manufacturer:
