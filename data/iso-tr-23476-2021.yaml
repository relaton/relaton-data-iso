abstract:
- content: |-
    This document is intended to be used alongside ISO/TR 12295, ISO 11226 and the ISO 11228 series in the agricultural sector. This document gives information on how existing standards can be used in a global sector such as agriculture where, albeit with different characteristics, biomechanical overload is a relevant aspect, WMSDs are common and specific preventive actions are needed.
    The proposed project aims to:
    1)    define the user(s) and fields for its application (including non-experts in ergonomics);
    2)    provide examples of procedures for hazard identification, risk estimation or evaluation and risk reduction in different agricultural settings, through:
    —    more synthetic procedural schemes (main test);
    —    more analytical explanations of the procedures, through mathematical models and application examples, also with the use of specific free simple tools, in:
    —   Annex A (pre-mapping with ERGOCHECK);
    —   Annex B (evaluation of Multitask risk of biomechanical overload on typical agricultural macro-cycles, considering upper limbs repetitive movements, manual lifting and carrying, pushing-pulling);
    —   Annex C (study of awkward postures with criteria derived from the actual standards and scientific literature as TACOS method).
