- content: |-
    This document specifies the requirements for the ultrasonic testing of steel castings (with ferritic structure) for general purposes, and the methods for determining internal discontinuities by the pulse-echo technique.
    This document applies to the ultrasonic testing of steel castings which have usually received a grain-refining heat treatment and which have wall thicknesses up to and including 600 mm. For greater wall thicknesses, special agreements apply with respect to the test procedure and the acceptance levels.
    This document does not apply to austenitic steels and to joint welds.
