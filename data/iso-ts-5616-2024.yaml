abstract:
- content: |-
    This document specifies the minimum governance procedure requirements for ITS data management and access using secure interfaces (and, particularly, secure vehicle interfaces) in order to meet objectives in accordance with the principles of ISO/TC 204 policy documents concerning ITS data governance policy.
    NOTE 1        Where an ITS data management and access paradigm is already in existence, this document proposes only to provide a suitable checklist for any assessment of its competency. This document does not propose that existing arrangements that are acceptably competent be changed.
    NOTE 2        This document does not affect proprietary original equipment manufacturer (OEM) communications using ExVe (see ISO 20077-1), but does provide means for its complementary coexistence.
