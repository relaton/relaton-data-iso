    This document specifies a field method for the determination of water-soluble chlorides in non-metallic blast-cleaning abrasives. This field method is provided as a kit with all components and premeasured extraction solution.
    This document differs from ISO 11127-7 in that equal volumes of the sample of abrasive and extraction solution are used for the determination of chloride level in the abrasive. In comparison, ISO 11127-7 uses a weight to volume ratio of abrasive to solvent (deionized water) to extract soluble salts from the abrasive. It is intended for use in the field as compared to ISO 11127-7, which is well suited for use in the laboratory.
