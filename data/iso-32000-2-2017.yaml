  content: "ISO 32000-2:2017 specifies a digital form for representing electronic
    documents to enable users to exchange and view electronic documents independent
    of the environment in which they were created or the environment in which they
    are viewed or printed. It is intended for developers of software that creates
    PDF files (PDF writers), software that reads existing PDF files and (usually)
    interprets their contents for display (PDF readers), software that reads and displays
    PDF content and interacts with the computer users to possibly modify and save
    the PDF file (interactive PDF processors) and PDF products that read and/or write
    PDF files for a variety of other purposes (PDF processors). (PDF writers and PDF
    readers are more specialised classifications of interactive PDF processors and
    all are PDF processors). \nISO 32000-2:2017 does not specify the following:\n-
    \     specific processes for converting paper or electronic documents to the PDF
    file format;\n-      specific technical design, user interface implementation,
    or operational details of rendering;\n-      specific physical methods of storing
    these documents such as media and storage conditions;\n-      methods for validating
    the conformance of PDF files or PDF processors;\n-      required computer hardware
    and/or operating system."
