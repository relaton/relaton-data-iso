  content: "ISO/ASTM 51940:2013 outlines dosimetric procedures to be followed for
    the radiation-induced reproductive sterilization of live insects for use in pest
    management programs. The primary use of such insects is in the Sterile Insect
    Technique, where large numbers of reproductively sterile insects are released
    into the field to mate with and thus control pest populations of the same species.
    A secondary use of sterile insects is as benign hosts for rearing insect parasitoids.
    The procedures outlined in this guide will help ensure that insects processed
    with ionizing radiation from gamma, electron, or X-ray sources receive absorbed
    doses within a predetermined range. Information on effective dose ranges for specific
    applications of insect sterilization, or on methodology for determining effective
    dose ranges, is not within the scope of this guide.\nNOTE 1 \x97 Dosimetry is
    only one component of a total quality assurance program to ensure that irradiated
    insects are adequately sterilized and fully competitive or otherwise suitable
    for their intended purpose."
