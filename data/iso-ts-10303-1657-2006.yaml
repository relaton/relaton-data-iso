- content: "ISO/TS 10303-1657:2006 specifies the application module for\n         Component
    feature.       \n         \n      \n\n     \n         ISO/TS 10303-1657:2006 deals
    with the representation of component features and the their relationships in a
    \n            \t\t\tphysical design view.  This is a fundamental enabling model
    for further\n            \t\tspecialization in ISO 10303.  This application model
    supports specialization of\n            \t\tcomponent features as terminals enabling
    application of connectivity properties and\n            \t\trequirements and supports
    assignment of the relationship between a component feature its \n            \t\t\tassignment
    to a part feature in the physical usage view.  This is an application of\n            \t\tintellectual
    property control and management for the design organization as it allows the\n
    \           \t\tdesign organization to maintain one master copy from which published
    models or catalogue data may be derived.\n            \t\n         \n\n         The
    following are within the scope of \n         ISO/TS 10303-1657:2006:\n         \n
    \     \n- the definition of features of components in the assembly of a design
    view;\n- the relationship between component features of various kinds such \n

    to part features in a usage \n            \t\t\tview;\n         \n- the definition
