- content: |-
    This document specifies performance and general test methods for liquefied natural gas fuel system components intended for use on the types of motor vehicles defined in ISO 3833.
    This document is applicable to vehicles (mono-fuel, bi-fuel or dual-fuel applications) using liquefied gas in accordance with the ISO 15403 series. It is not applicable to the following: original-production and converted vehicles.
    This document is only applicable on the components in the "LNG system" meaning an assembly of components (tanks, valves, flexible fuel lines, etc.) and connecting parts (fuel lines, fittings, etc.) fitted on motor vehicles using LNG in their propulsion system and related components up to and including the vaporizer. Other parts downstream from the vaporizer are considered as CNG components covered by ISO 15501.
    NOTE       All references to pressures, given in megapascals and bar (1 bar = 0,1 MPa = 105 Pa; 1 MPa = 1 N/mm2) are considered gauge pressures, unless otherwise specified.
