  content: ISO 9912-1:2004 defines terms used in relation to filters intended for
    agricultural micro-irrigation systems -- in particular, pressurized systems --
    and provides a means of classifying those filters according to filtration method,
    structure, operating principle and function. It does not deal with classification
    according to the type of water intended to be filtered; nor does it apply to the
    classification of filters for potable or domestic water use.
