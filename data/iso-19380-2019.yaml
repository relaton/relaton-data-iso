  content: This document describes a standard method for measuring a vehicle's longitudinal
    and lateral (horizontal plane) centre of gravity (CG) positions and three methods
    for estimating a vehicle's vertical CG position, the axle lift, tilt-table, and
    stable pendulum methods. It applies to heavy vehicles, that is commercial vehicles
    and buses as defined in ISO 3833 (trucks and trailers with maximum weight above
    3,5 tonnes and buses and articulated buses with maximum weight above 5 tonnes,
    according to ECE and EC vehicle classification, categories M3, N2, N3, O3 and
    O4). CG measurements are performed separately for each single unit.
