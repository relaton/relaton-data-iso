abstract:
- content: "ISO/TS 21220:2009 presents test methods and specifies a test rig for measuring
    the filter performance of particulate air filters used for general ventilation.
    The test rig is designed for an air flow rate of between 0,25 m3/s  [900 m3/h
    (530 ft3/min)] and 1,5 m3/s [5 400 m3/h (3 178 ft3/min)]. \nISO/TS 21220:2009
    is applicable to air filters having an initial efficiency of less than 99 % with
    respect to 0,4 µm particles. Filters in the higher end and those with an above
    99 % initial efficiency are tested and classified according to other standards.\nIt
    combines two test methods: a “fine” method for air filters in the higher efficiency
    range and a “coarse” method for filters of lower efficiency. In either case, a
    flat‑sheet media sample or media pack sample from an identical filter is conditioned
    (discharged) to provide information about the intensity of the electrostatic removal
    mechanism. After determination of its initial efficiency, the untreated filter
    is loaded with synthetic dust in a single step until its final test pressure drop
    is reached. Information on the loaded performance of the filter is then obtained.
    \nThe performance results thus obtained cannot alone be quantitatively applied
    to predict in‑service performance with regard to efficiency and lifetime, so other
    factors influencing performance are also presented."
