abstract:
- content: |-
    This document specifies a method for the determination of the alkali reserve of papers and boards. lt is intended for products that contain alkaline pigments or other alkaline material, added to improve their resistance to acid attack (degradation).
    This document is not applicable to laminated, printed or otherwise processed grades that will not disintegrate completely by the procedure described.
    The result obtained will include alkaline pigments contained in the coating of a coated paper.
    NOTE   Such alkaline coating will protect the core of the paper from acid substances in ambient air, but its effect on acid substances generated in the base paper itself is uncertain.
