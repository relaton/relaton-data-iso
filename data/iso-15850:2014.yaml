  content: "ISO 15850:2014 specifies a method for measuring the propagation of a crack
    in a notched specimen subjected to a cyclic tensile load varying between a constant
    positive minimum and a constant positive maximum value. The test results include
    the crack length as a function of the number of load cycles and the crack length
    increase rate as a function of the stress intensity factor and energy release
    rate at the crack tip. The possible occurrence of discontinuities in crack propagation
    is detected and reported.\nThe test can be also used for the purpose of determining
    the resistance to crack propagation failure. In this case, the results can be
    presented in the form of number of cycles to failure or total time taken to cause
    crack propagation failure versus the stress intensity factor. "
