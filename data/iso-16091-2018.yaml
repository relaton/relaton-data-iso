    This document describes the set of management requirements needed to identify and provide logistic support, so the customer can operate and maintain a product in its operational environment for the expected lifetime.
    These requirements also aim, throughout the product life cycle, at implementing everything pertinent to the control of risks considered as critical for operational objectives.
    The management requirements are applicable to those activities necessary to design, develop, deliver, deploy and manage an organized and structured set of materials and software, services, processes and information dedicated to support the system throughout its life cycle.
    This document specifies management, studies, production activities, information management processes and tasks to meet the customer's need for logistic support.
    When viewed from the perspective of a specific project context, the requirements defined in this document are tailored to match the genuine requirements of a particular profile and circumstances of a project.
    NOTE       Tailoring is the process by which individual requirements of specifications, standards and related documents are evaluated, and made applicable to a specific project by selection, and in some exceptional cases, modification of existing or addition of new requirements.
