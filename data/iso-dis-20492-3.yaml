  content: ISO 20492-3:2010 specifies two methods of test for insulating glass units,
    including a determination of the gas leakage rate and a determination of gas concentration
    tolerances. The two methods designated as approach 1, which is intended for use
    in markets such as North America, and approach 2, which is intended for use in
    markets such as Europe.
