  content: "ISO/TS 13473-4:2008 describes the methods that are available to perform
    a spectral analysis of pavement surface profile signals. It specifies three possible
    methods for spatial frequency analysis (or texture wavelength analysis) of two-dimensional
    surface profiles that describe the pavement roughness amplitude as a function
    of the distance along a straight or curved trajectory over the pavement. The result
    of the frequency analysis will be a spatial frequency (or texture wavelength)
    spectrum in constant-percentage bandwidth bands of octave or one-third-octave
    bandwidth. \nISO/TS 13473-4:2008 offers three alternative methods to obtain these
    spectra: 1) analogue constant-percentage bandwidth filtering; 2) digital constant-percentage
    bandwidth filtering; 3) constant narrow bandwidth frequency analysis by means
    of Discrete Fourier Transform, followed by a transformation of the narrow-band
    spectrum to an octave- or one-third-octave-band spectrum.\nThe objective of ISO/TS
    13473-4:2008 is to standardize the spectral characterization of pavement surface
    profiles. This objective is pursued by providing a detailed description of the
    analysis methods and related requirements for those who are involved in pavement
    characterization, but are not familiar with general principles of frequency analysis
    of random signals. These methods and requirements are generally applicable to
    all types of random signals."
