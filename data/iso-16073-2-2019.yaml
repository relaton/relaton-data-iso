    This document specifies the minimum performance requirements and test methods for assessing compatibility of wildland firefighters' personal protective equipment (PPE).
    This document does not cover PPE for structural firefighting (see ISO 11999 series), for use against chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear hazards, or for use where a reflective outer surface is required (see ISO 15538).
    Activities in support of wildland firefighting, such as the cutting of trees and the use of a chainsaw can require additional compatibility testing to that provided in this document. Users are directed to those relevant standards for the requirements associated with such protection.
