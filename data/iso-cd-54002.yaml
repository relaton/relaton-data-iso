abstract:
- content: "This document has been developed to help police organizations meet their
    intended results by applying quality management practices as specified in ISO
    9001:2015 Quality management systems – Requirements.\nThis document does not prescribe
    mandatory approaches to implementation. This document does not provide any preferred
    method of interpretation. Finally, this document does not add, reduce or modify
    in any way the requirements of ISO 9001:2015.\nThis document provides guidance,
    corresponding to ISO 9001:2015 Clauses 4 to 10. ISO 9001:2015 is maintained in
    a separate document from the specific police organization guidance provided for
    each clause. These guidelines are not additional requirements to ISO 9001:2015.
    Instead, they are intended to help police organizations implement the quality
    management system effectively. These guidelines provide clarification and examples
    of effective police service management practices. The annexes contain additional
    information.\nISO 9001 contains requirements that can be objectively audited or
    evaluated. This document includes examples, descriptions, and options that help
    implement the quality management system in a police organization. This documents
    also strengthens the quality system with the overall management system of the
    police organization.\nThis document does not provide definitive interpretations
    of ISO 9001. This document is not intended to be used for audit or assessment;
    an organization would still be assessed to ISO 9001.\nAnnex A should be used by
    police organizations initially evaluating their organization. Annex A evaluates
    the scope and maturity of their processes and products and services. Annex B defines
    the quality system processes necessary to provide reliable services and products
    to customers/citizens. Annex C provides information on terminology within a police
    organization. Annex D provides other documents that may be of use to police organizations
    and Annex E provides information on how the United Nations Sustainable Development
    Goals can be applied within the quality management system of police organizations.
    \nThe requirements from ISO 9001 are generic, as they can be applied by any organization.
    This document can be used by police organizations of all types, sizes, maturity
    level service, and geographic location (for example, police stations, border crossings,
    correctional facilities, civil defense). However, how a police organization applies
    guidance can vary. This variance depends on factors such as:\n—     the size or
    complexity of the organization;\n—     the model of management it adopts;\n—    
    the range of activities and services provided by the organization;\n—     the
    nature of risks and opportunities it encounters."
