abstract:
- content: The determination consists in slow and progressive cooling of the essential
    oil and observation of the variations in temperature as the oil passes from the
    liquid to the solid state. The apparatur for determination of freezing point consists
    of a wide-mouthed container of about 500 ml capacity, provided with a bored cork
    or rubber stopper into which a stout-walled test tube is inserted. Another smaller
    test tube is fitted into the stout-walled test tube by means of another bored
    cork or rubber stopper. Into the smaller test tube a thermometer is inserted.
