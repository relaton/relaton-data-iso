  content: Describes test methods for determining the strength and durability (mainly
    regarding fatigue and wear) of storage units that are fully assembled and ready
    for use, including their movable and non-movable parts. Assessment of ageing and
    degradation is not included. The tests consist of the application of loads, forces
    and velocities simulating normal functional use as well as misuse to be expected
    and are designed to evaluate properties without regard to materials, design/construction
    or manufacturing processes. Does not specify requirements to be met.
