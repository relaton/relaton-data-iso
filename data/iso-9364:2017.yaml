    ISO 9364:2017 is applicable to the requirements for steel sheet, in coils and cut lengths, metallic-coated by the continuous hot-dip process with 55 % aluminium-zinc alloy coating.
    The product is intended for applications requiring the corrosion characteristics of aluminium coupled with those of zinc, or heat resistance, or both.
    The steel sheet is produced in a number of quality designations and grades, coating mass, surface treatments and coating finish conditions designed to be compatible with differing application requirements.
