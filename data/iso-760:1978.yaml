abstract:
- content: Two methods of titration depending on whether the end point is detected
    visually or electrometrically are specified. The visual method is only applicable
    to colourless solutions but can be used when no electrometric apparatus is available.
    The electrometric method, whether by direct titration or back-titration, is the
    more accurate one and for this reason recommended. The principle of the test consists
    in reaction of any water present in a test portion with a solution of iodine and
    sulphur dioxide in a pyridine/methanol mixture (Karl Fischer reagent), previously
    standardized by titration with an exactly known mass of water.
