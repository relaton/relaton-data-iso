    This document specifies a test method for the cleaning of hard flooring surfaces. It can be used to demonstrate the comparative cleaning performance of a fine bubble solution to an alternate cleaning solution to remove contaminant from a soiled surface. This alternate cleaning solution can be another fine bubble solution, municipal tap water or a commercially available cleaning solution blended to the manufacturer’s specifications.
    This method is not suitable for differentiating between cleaning solutions when the contaminant is excessively applied on the surface as the mechanism of cleaning changes.
