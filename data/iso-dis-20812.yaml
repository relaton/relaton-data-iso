    This document specifies the requirements and test methods for factory-made cellular glass products which are to be used for thermal insulation of buildings. The products are manufactured in the form of slabs, faced or unfaced boards.

    This document describes product characteristics and test methods, designation code, marking and labelling.

    Products used in prefabricated thermal insulation systems, such as for equipment, and composite panels, and their performance, are not covered or within the scope of this document.
