- content: |-
    This document gives guidance for leaders in smart cities and communities (from the public, private and voluntary sectors) on how to develop an open, collaborative, citizen-centric and digitally-enabled operating model for their city that puts its vision for a sustainable future into operation.
    This document does not describe a one-size-fits-all model for the future of cities. Rather, the focus is on the enabling processes by which innovative use of technology and data, coupled with organizational change, can help each city deliver its own specific vision for a sustainable future in more efficient, effective and agile ways.
    This document provides proven tools that cities can deploy when operationalizing the vision, strategy and policy agenda they have developed following the adoption of ISO 37101, the management system for sustainable development of communities. It can also be used, either in whole or in part, by cities that have not committed to deployment of the ISO 37101 management system.
