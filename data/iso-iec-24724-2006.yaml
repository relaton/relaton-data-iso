  content: "The GS1 Reduced Space Symbology (RSS) family contains three linear symbologies
    (RSS-14, RSS Limited and RSS Expanded) to be used with the GS1 system. The use
    of the symbology is intended to comply with the GS1 application guidelines as
    defined in the GS1 General Specifications.\nRSS-14 encodes the full 14-digit GS1
    item identification in a linear symbol that can be scanned omnidirectionally by
    suitably programmed point-of-sale scanners. RSS Limited encodes a 14-digit GS1
    item ?identification with Indicator digits of zero or one in a linear symbol for
    use on small items that will not be scanned at the point-of-sale. RSS Expanded
    encodes GS1 item identification plus supplementary AI element strings such as
    weight and 'best before' date in a linear symbol that can be scanned omnidirectionally
    by suitably programmed point-of-sale scanners. \nRSS-14 Stacked is a variation
    of the RSS-14 symbology that is stacked in two rows and is used when the normal
    symbol would be too wide for the application. It comes in two versions, a truncated
    version used for small item marking applications and a taller omnidirectional
    version which is designed to be read by omnidirectional scanners. RSS Expanded
    can also be printed in multiple rows as a stacked symbol.\nAny member of the RSS
    family can be printed as a stand-alone linear symbol or as part of an EAN.UCC
    Composite symbol with an accompanying two-dimensional component printed above
    the RSS linear component.\nGS1 RSS bar code symbols are intended for encoding
    identification numbers and data supplementary to the identification. The administration
    of the numbering system by EAN and UCC ensures that identification codes assigned
    to particular items are unique worldwide and that they and the associated supplementary
    data are defined in a consistent way. The major benefit for the users of the GS1
    system is the availability of uniquely defined identification codes and supplementary
    data formats for use in their trading transactions.\nISO/IEC 24724:2006 defines
    the requirements for the RSS symbology family. It specifies the characteristics
    of the RSS symbology family, data character encodation, symbol formats, dimensions,
    print quality requirements, error detection, and decoding algorithms. \nFor EAN.UCC
    Composite symbols, ISO/IEC 24723 defines the two-dimensional component."
