    provide the service, defines the relationship between the service and management
    notifications, defines relationships with other systems management functions,
    specifies conformance requirements. The security alarm reporting function is a
    systems management function which may be used by an application process in a centralized
    or decentralized management environment to exchange information for the purpose
    of systems management.
