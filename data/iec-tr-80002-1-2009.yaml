  content: IEC/TR 80002-1:2009(E) provides guidance for the application of the requirements
    contained in ISO 14971:2007, Medical devices - Application of risk management
    to medical devices to medical device software with reference to IEC 62304:2006,
    Medical device software - Software life cycle processes. It does not add to, or
    otherwise change, the requirements of ISO 14971:2007 or IEC 62304:2006. IEC/TR
    80002-1:2009(E) is aimed at risk management practitioners who need to perform
    risk management when software is included in the medical device/system, and at
    software engineers who need to understand how to fulfil the requirements for risk
    management addressed in ISO 14971. ISO 14971, recognized worldwide by regulators,
    is widely acknowledged as the principal standard to use when performing medical
    device risk management. IEC 62304:2006, makes a normative reference to ISO 14971
    requiring its use. The content of these two standards provides the foundation
    for this technical report. It should be noted that even though ISO 14971 and this
    technical report focus on medical devices, this technical report may be used to
    implement a safety risk management process for all software in the healthcare
    environment independent of whether it is classified as a medical device. IEC/TR
    80002-1:2009 is not intended to be used as the basis of regulatory inspection
    or certification assessment activities.
