    This international standard specifies the requirements for factory-made rigid nano-microporous insulation, for use in industrial applications. This document specifies insulation that exhibits thermal insulating performance through nano-sized-pore composite material. The material comprises a blend of inorganic powder, fibres and opacifiers. The products are delivered as board or pipe section type.

    This document describes product characteristics and includes procedures for testing, evaluation of conformity, marking and labelling.

    This document does not specify the required level of a given property to be achieved by a product to demonstrate fitness for purpose in a particular application. The levels required for a given application are to be found in regulations or non-conflicting standards
