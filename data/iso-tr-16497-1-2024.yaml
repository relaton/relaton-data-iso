- content: "This document compiles use cases for the implementation of sustainable
    mobility services. The collected data will be analysed to identify issues for
    international standardization. \nThis document focuses on use cases that aim to
    implement sustainable transport services. The use cases considered are at the
    city scale or metropolitan scale, aligned with the scope of smart cities and communities.
    The use cases encompass land transport, water transport, and air transport for
    both passengers and freight.\nIdeas related to connection and integration, including
