  content: The soap is dissolved in an ethanolic solution, the free alkali is neutralized
    with a known excess of sulphuric acid solution and the excess acid is titrated
    with ethanolic potassium hydroxide solution. The method is not applicable if the
    soap cantains additives (alkali, silicates, etw.) which can be decomposed by sulphuric
    acid by the procedure specified. The method is also not applicable to coloured
    soaps if the colour interferes with the phenolphthalein end point.
