abstract:
- content: |-
    ISO 26429-6:2008 defines the syntax of encrypted digital cinema non-interleaved material exchange format (MXF) frame-wrapped track files and specifies a matching reference decryption model. It uses the advanced encryption standard (AES) cipher algorithm for essence encryption and, optionally, the HMAC-SHA1 algorithm for essence integrity. The digital cinema track file format is designed to carry digital cinema essence for distribution to exhibition sites and is specified in the sound and picture track file specification.
    ISO 26429-6:2008 assumes that the cryptographic keys necessary to decrypt and verify the integrity of encrypted track files will be available upon demand. More precisely, it does not specify the fashion with which cryptographic keys and usage rights are managed across digital cinema distribution and exhibition environments.
    In addition, ISO 26429-6:2008 does not address, but does not preclude, the use of watermarking, fingerprinting or other security techniques to provide additional protection. The scope is limited to digital cinema and does not define a generic MXF encryption framework.
