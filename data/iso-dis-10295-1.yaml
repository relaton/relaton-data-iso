    ISO 10295-1:2007 specifies the heating condition, method of test and criteria for the evaluation of the ability of a penetration sealing system to maintain the integrity and insulation of a fire separating element at the position at which it has been penetrated, for example by a service.
    ISO 10295-1:2007 assesses the effect of such penetrations on the integrity and insulation performance of the element concerned, the integrity and insulation performance of the penetration sealing system, the insulation performance of the penetrating service or services, and where appropriate, the integrity failure of a service.
    ISO 10295-1:2007 does not provide information concerning the influence of the inclusion of such penetrations and sealing systems on the load-bearing capacity of the element.
    It is possible that a penetration seal is a component of, or contributes to the performance of, a system to which special requirements apply. In such cases additional tests, relevant to the system and its function, can be necessary. Examples are chimneys and fire-rated ducts in air distribution systems.
    ISO 10295-1:2007 is not intended to provide quantitative information on the rate of leakage of smoke and/or hot gases or on the transmission or generation of fumes. Such phenomena are to be noted in describing the general behaviour of specimens during test.
    ISO 10295-1:2007 does not provide information on the ability of the seal to withstand stresses that can be caused by the movement or displacement of the penetration services in practice.
