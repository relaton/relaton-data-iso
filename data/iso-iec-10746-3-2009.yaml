  content: "ISO/IEC 10746 provides a coordinating framework for the standardization
    of open distributed processing (ODP). This supports distribution, interworking,
    portability, and platform and technology independence. It establishes an enterprise
    architecture framework for the specification of ODP systems.\nISO/IEC 10746 defines
    the essential concepts necessary to specify open distributed processing systems
    from five prescribed viewpoints. It provides a well-developed framework for the
    structuring of specifications for large-scale, distributed systems.\nThe framework
    for system specification provided by ISO/IEC 10746 has four fundamental elements:\n-
    an object modelling approach to system specification;\n- the specification of
    a system in terms of separate but interrelated viewpoint specifications;\n- the
    definition of a system infrastructure providing distribution transparencies for
    system applications;\n- a framework for assessing system conformance. \nISO/IEC
    10746-3:2009 specifies the required characteristics that qualify distributed processing
    as open, i.e. the constraints to which ODP standards must conform. It uses the
    descriptive techniques from ISO/IEC 10746-2 to define five ISO/IEC 10746 viewpoints.
    These viewpoints are subdivisions of the specification of a whole system, established
    to bring together the particular pieces of information relevant to some stakeholder
    or particular area of concern. ISO/IEC 10746-3:2009 also defines a taxonomy for
    functions and structures to realize distribution transparencies."
