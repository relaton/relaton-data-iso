    This document specifies the business operational view of an implementation of an Open-edi Distributed Business Transaction Repository (OeDBTR), building on the principles and concepts defined in ISO/IEC 15944-4 of a business transaction. The repository stores the history of the transitions in states of the economic claim and/or other business entities that happen over the course of a business transaction, and does so for a collection of business events. These business events, comprised of transactions and their states, can be identified unambiguously so as to provide the ability to inspect or query the information at some point after the record has been made. The distributed nature of the repository offers users ubiquitous and robust access to the recorded history.
    A history of business transactions of market exchanges can be useful in auditing or other memoing-based activities, looking back at the immutable record of the interactions between parties.
    This document does not specify the Functional Services View of a particular implementation of an Open-edi Distributed Business Transaction Repository. For best performance, candidate technologies would likely exhibit properties of long-term permanence, robust immutability, decentralized access, distributed resilience, and fine-grained addressability.
