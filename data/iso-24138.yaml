abstract:
- content: |-
    This document specifies the syntax and structure of the International Standard Content Code (ISCC), as an identification system for digital assets   (including encodings of text, images, audio, video or other content across all media-sectors). It also describes ISCC metadata and the use of ISCC in   conjunction with other schemes, such as the schemes defined by ISO/TC 46/SC 9.
    An ISCC applies to a specific digital asset and is a data-descriptor constructed from multiple hashes using the algorithms and rules in this document.
    Organisations, individuals and machines may generate ISCCs for numerous kinds of digital assets and use them for identification and management of those assets.
    The generation or use of an ISCC in itself does not make any statement or claim about authorship or ownership of the identified content.
