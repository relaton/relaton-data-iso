abstract:
- content: This document specifies a procedure to introduce smart transportation into
    cities by means of fuel cell light rail transit (FC-LRT). This service contributes
    to a cleaner atmosphere, with zero emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and small
    particles, an urban view free of catenaries and easy installation of LRT transportation
    operations, providing safe and comfortable rides for citizens.
