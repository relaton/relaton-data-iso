  content: Presents basic methods for the determination of seismic actions on structures.
    Specifies methods of evaluating seismic actions for the earthquake-resistant design
    of buildings, towers, chimneys, and similar structures. Most of the principles
    are applicable also to stuctures such as bridges, dams, harbour installations,
    tunnels, fuel storage tanks, chemical plants, conventional power plants excluding
    nuclear power plants.
