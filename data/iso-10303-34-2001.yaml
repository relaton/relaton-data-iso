    This part of ISO 10303 specifies the abstract test methods for conformance testing of an implementation
    of an ISO 10303 Application Protocol (AP). The scope is limited to the following implementation
    methods:
    — preprocessors that claim to generate 10303 schema instances represented as exchange structures as
    defined by ISO 10303-21;
    — postprocessors that claim to accept and process 10303 schema instances represented as exchange
    structures as defined by ISO 10303-21;
    — preprocessors that claim to generate 10303 schema instances and use the SDAI interface as
    defined in ISO 10303-22 to populate an SDAI implementation with these schema instances;
    — postprocessors that claim to accept 10303 schema instances and use the SDAI interface as defined
    in ISO 10303-22 to extract schema instances from an SDAI implementation.
    The following are within the scope of this part of ISO 10303:
    — the conformance assessment process undertaken to evaluate the conformity of an implementation
    of an ISO 10303 application protocol. The abstract test methods are independently applicable to
    implementation methods based on ISO 10303-21 and ISO 10303-22;
    — the methods to be followed by the testing laboratory using executable test cases (ETC). The
    methods presented are abstract, that is, they are independent of the implementation under test (IUT).
    The method descriptions cover the different steps from abstract test case (ATC) selection to test case
    report production.
    The following is outside the scope of this part of ISO 10303:
    — the generation of executable test cases from abstract test cases. This part of ISO 10303 does not
    include abstract test methods for conformance testing of application protocol independent
    implementations of the Standard Data Access Interface (SDAI) -- ISO 10303-22.
