abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 24775-7:2014(E) defines management profiles for autonomous, component
    and abstract profiles for management of host-based storage devices. The autonomous
    profiles describe the management of a stand-alone host-based storage entity. The
    component profiles (or subprofiles) describe management of aspects of host-based
    storage entities that may be used by other autonomous profiles. Finally, this
    standard describes abstract profiles that may be used as a basis for creating
    additional Host-based autonomous profiles. This International Standard, together
    with ISO/IEC 24775-1 to ISO/IEC 24775-6 and ISO/IEC 24775-8, replaces ISO/IEC
    24775, second edition, published in 2011, and constitutes a technical revision.
    It includes the following technical changes:                              \n-
    reorganization into eight parts;                            \n- maturity identification
    using stages and new profiles."
