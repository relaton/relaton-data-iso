  content: "OpenID Connect 1.0 is a simple identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0
    protocol. It enables Clients to verify the identity of the End-User based on the
    authentication performed by an Authorization Server, as well as to obtain basic
    profile information about the End-User in an interoperable and REST-like manner.
    \nThis document defines a logout mechanism that uses direct back-channel communication
    between the OP and RPs being logged out; this differs from front-channel logout
    mechanisms, which communicate logout requests from the OP to RPs via the User
    Agent. "
