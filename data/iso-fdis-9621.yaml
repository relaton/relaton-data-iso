    This standard provides technical methods to calculate the precipitation efficiency and liability of a flight hardware by measuring the screen effectiveness of thermal cycles. This standard can be applied, but not be limited to those recurring production, such as higher volume production or hardware of constellation programs, with a constant block of design, manufacture, as an option for those who wishes to modify or reduce the numbers of cycles with own database as a supplement standard of ISO 15864.

    In case that the number of thermal cycles is agreed with the customer’s specified standard or determined by other means, this standard may be used as a supplement technical informative reference.
