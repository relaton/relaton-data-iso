    ISO/IEC 33063:2015
    -     defines a process assessment model that meets the requirements of ISO/IEC 33004 and that supports the performance of an assessment of process capability using the process measurement framework defined in ISO/IEC 33020. The process assessment model provides indicators for guidance on the interpretation of the process purposes and outcomes as defined in ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119‑2 and the process attributes as defined in ISO/IEC 33020, and
    -     provides guidance, by example, on the definition, selection, and use of assessment indicators.
    A process assessment model comprises a set of indicators of process performance and process capability. The indicators are used as a basis for collecting the objective evidence that enables an assessor to assign ratings, following the requirements of ISO/IEC 33002. The set of indicators included in this International Standard is not intended to be an all-inclusive set nor is it intended to be applicable in its entirety. Subsets that are appropriate to the context and scope of the assessment should be selected.
    The process assessment model in this International Standard is directed at assessment sponsors and competent assessors who wish to select a model and associated documented process method for assessment (for either capability determination or process improvement).
    Any process assessment model for software testing meeting the requirements defined in ISO/IEC 33004 concerning models for process assessment may be used for assessment. Different models and methods might be needed to address differing business and testing needs. This assessment model is provided as an exemplar of a model meeting all the requirements expressed in ISO/IEC 33004.
