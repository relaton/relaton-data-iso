    ISO 9912-2:2013 specifies general construction requirements and test methods for strainer filters and disc filters intended for operation in agricultural irrigation systems.
    It does not cover the aspects of filtration ability, efficiency and capacity (like quality of filtered water or time of operation before a filter becomes entirely clogged), nor does it deal with structural requirements or tests of automatic flushing mechanism filters that are covered by ISO 9912-3.
