  content: "ISO 16175-1 establishes fundamental principles and functional requirements
    for software used to create and manage digital records in office environments.
    It is intended to be used in conjunction with ISO 16175-2 and ISO 16175-3.\nISO
    16175-1 establishes the principles of good practice, guiding principles, implementation
    guidelines and lists risks and mitigations for the purpose of\n- enabling better
    management of records in organisations;\n- supporting the business needs of an
    organisation by enabling greater effectiveness and efficiency of the operations;\n-
    providing, through wider deployment of automated records functionality, enhanced
    abilities to support auditing activities;\n- improving capabilities to comply
    with statutory mandates specified in various information-related legislation (for
    example, data protection and privacy);\n- ensuring good governance (for example,
    accountability, transparency and enhanced service delivery) through good management
    of records; \n- increasing general awareness of automated records management capabilities
    via the dissemination of key principles; and\n- maximizing cross-jurisdictional
    consistency regarding the articulation of functional requirements for managing
    records and to enable the global archives, records and information management
    community to speak with one voice to the software vendor community."
