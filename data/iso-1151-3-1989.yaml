abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: Deals with derivatives of forces, moments and of other quantities characterizing
    such forces and moments. The term "derivative" designates the partial derivative
    of a function with respect to an independent variable. These derivatives appear
    in the terms of the Taylor series representing the variations of functions with
    the independent variables. Is restricted to first-order terms. Terms of higher
    order would require additional definitions of higher order. The aircraft is assumed
    to be rigid. However, most of the definitions can be applied to the case of a
    flexible aircraft.
