  content: Specifies the general construction requirements and test methods (resistance
    of strainer to internal hydrostatic pressure, resistance of strainer to internal
    hydrostatic pressure at high temperature, resistance of filter element to buckling
    or tearing, tightness of filter element, clean pressure drop). Does not cover
    filtration ability, efficiency and capacity, nor deals with filters that have
    integrated automatic self-cleaning devices.
