    1 Scope
    This International Standard specifies the requirements, test methods and installation technologies applicable
    to ductile iron pipes used in trenchless applications:
    — to convey water or wastewater;
    — operated with or without pressure.
    NOTE In this International Standard, all pressures are relative pressures expressed in bar(s)1).
    This International Standard specifies materials, dimensions and tolerances, mechanical properties and
    standard coatings of pipes, fittings and accessories. It also gives performance requirements for all components
    including joints.
    Joint design and gasket shapes are outside the scope of this International Standard.
    This International Standard applies to pipes, fittings and accessories cast by any type of foundry process or
    manufactured by fabrication of cast components, as well as corresponding joints, of a size range DN 80 to DN
    2 600 inclusive.
