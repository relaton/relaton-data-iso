abstract:
- content: "This document defines key terms and parameters applied in the analysis
    of cognitive and visual-manual workload induced by transport information and control
    systems (TICS). It provides guidelines and minimum requirements on equipment and
    procedures for analysing cognitive and visual-manual load including assessment
    of TICS to: \n— plan evaluation trials; \n— specify (and install) data capture
    equipment; and \n— validate, analyse, interpret and report metrics indicating
    cognitive and visual-manual demand (standards of measurement). \n\nThe described
    parameters and definitions provide a common source of reference for cognitive
    and visual-manual workload induced by TICS. It is applicable to standardized trials
    in laboratory-based settings. The procedures described in this document can also
    apply to more general assessments of cognitive and visual-manual workload while
    driving. Data collected and analysed according to this document will allow comparisons
    to be performed across different TICS applications."
