abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 29116-1:2008 specifies a set of protocols to be used in conjunction
    with ISO/IEC 23000-5, in applications where governed audio and video information
    is streamed to an end-user device, named the Media Streaming Player. \nMedia Streaming
    Players can interact with a number of Media Streaming Devices:\n- Content Provider
    Device, a device capable of interacting with a Media Streaming Player to provide
    content;\n- Licence Provider Device, a device capable of interacting with a Media
    Streaming Player to provide licences;\n- IPMP Tool Provider Device, a device capable
    of interacting with a Media Streaming Player to provide IPMP Tools, i.e. modules
    performing one or more functions such as encryption, watermarking, etc.;\n- Domain
    Management Device, a device capable of managing various functions needed for a
    proper functioning of a domain.\nTwo types of protocols are the target of ISO/IEC
    29116-1:2008: the Access Protocols and the Domain Management Protocols. \nThe
    Access Protocols specify how a Media Streaming Player can obtain from another
    Media Streaming Device the following information:\n- a content item or any of
    its parts, either streamed to an end-user device by means of existing protocols
    such as MPEG-2 Transport Stream or Real Time Protocol over Internet Protocol (RTP/IP)
    or stored in an MPEG-21 file;\n- a licence, which can grant the Media Streaming
    Player or its user(s) some rights over a content item or any of its parts, possibly
    under some conditions;\n- executable code implementing security functions\nThe
    Domain Management Protocols specify how a number of devices and/or users can be
    grouped in a domain, groups of devices or users sharing some common properties.
    By using domains it becomes possible to implement more flexible licensing modalities,
    e.g. to license content to all devices or users in a domain. Domain Management
    Protocols include the specification of technologies for achieving the following
    goals:\n- creating, renewing or deleting a domain; \n- issuing domain membership
    licences for devices and users;\n- managing devices and users memberships of a
    domain, i.e. joining, renewing and leaving a domain;\n- verifying that domain-bound
    content has been used within the domain according to licence terms."
