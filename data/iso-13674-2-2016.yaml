    ISO 13674-2:2016 specifies a test schedule that addresses a particular aspect of the transition test, the on-centre handling characteristics of a vehicle. It is applicable to passenger cars in accordance with ISO 3833 and to light trucks, N1 category.
    NOTE          The manoeuvre specified in this test method is not representative of real driving conditions, but is useful for obtaining measures of vehicle on-centre handling behaviour in response to a specific type of steering input under closely controlled test conditions. Other aspects of on-centre handling are addressed in the companion ISO 13674‑1.
