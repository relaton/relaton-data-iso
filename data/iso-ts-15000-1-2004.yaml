abstract:
- content: ISO 15000-1:2004 specifies the requirements for a collaboration-protocol
    profile (CPP), and a collaboration-protocol agreement (CPA). The CPP describes
    a trading partner's technical capabilities for performing electronic business.
    The CPA describes the agreement between two trading partners on the technical
    capabilities they will use for a specific electronic-business collaboration. Included
    in the CPP and CPA are details of transport, messaging (using ISO 15000-2:2004),
    security constraints, and binding to a business-process-specification document
    that contains the definition of the interactions between the two parties while
    engaging in a specified electronic business collaboration. ISO 15000-1:2004 defines
    the mark-up language vocabulary for creating the electronic CPPs and CPAs and
    includes examples of a pair of CPPs and a CPA derived from them, the process specification
    document referenced by the CPPs and CPA, and the XML schema governing the structures
    of CPPs and CPAs. A prospective trading partner may publish one or more CPPs.
    A CPA for a business collaboration between two trading partners is derived by
    combining one CPP from each trading partner. The "legal" terms and conditions
    of a Business agreement are outside the scope of ISO 15000-1:2004.
