    This document outlines requirements for sampling from hydrogen fuelling stations for samples taken at the dispenser. The document defines the best practice for sampling at the nozzle of a hydrogen fuelling station as part of the fuelling station acceptance testing, and ongoing operation.
    Further, the document describes the minimum safety requirements for sampling.
    This document is targeted for the sampling from the hydrogen fuelling station dispenser. Many of the generic requirements within this document are applicable to sampling at other locations within the hydrogen fuelling station, which can be carried out for hydrogen quality assurance, see ISO 19880-8, however, further specific requirements that can be necessary for safe sampling are not addressed in this document.
    The intention of sampling hydrogen is to enable analysis against the requirements of ISO 14687, and by analytical methods validated by protocols described in ISO 21087.
    This document supersedes, and is an extension to, the guidance published in ISO 19880-1:2020, Annex K.
    NOTE            Analytical methods are divided into on-line analyses and off-line analyses. On-line analysis allows for real time analysis at hydrogen stations and is not covered in this document.
