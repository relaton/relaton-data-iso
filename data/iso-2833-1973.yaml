  content: The principle consists in separation of the fluorine from a test portion
    by distillation with sulphuric acid or perchloric acid. Titration with thorium
    nitrate solution using sodium alizarinsuphonate and methylene blue as indicators.
    Alternatively the thorium nitrate titration may be carried out using sodium alizarinsuphonate
    alone as indicator, the end-point being determined spectrophotometrically under
    carefully defined conditions. The absorbance at a wavelength of 525 nm shall reach
    the arbitrary value of 0.6. Has also been approved by the IUPAC.
