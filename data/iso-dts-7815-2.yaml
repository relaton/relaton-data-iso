    The scope of this document is to define the requirements for a secure vehicle interface for the provision of TARV (Telematics Applications for Regulated Vehicles) application services data to jurisdictions and other relevant parties in the paradigm that:
    a) A secure credential management system (SCMS) already exists for ITS data management and access in the location of the service provision
    b) An SCMS does not yet exist for ITS data management and access in the location of the service provision
