    This document specifies general and manufacturing requirements for tethered unmanned aircraft systems (tUAS), including heavier-than-air tethered unmanned aircraft (tUA), which are powered by equipment on the ground. The specifications are intended for tUAS where the purpose for the tether is to supply power to the tUA as well as to provide a mechanical restraint. Unmanned aircrafts (UAs) that are not receiving power from and only restrained by the tether are referred to ISO 21384-2; however, there are clauses in this document that apply to the tethering equipment (e.g. winches and cables).
    This document is applicable to the development, manufacturing, industrial applications and delivery of tUAS.
