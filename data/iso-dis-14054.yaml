abstract:
- content: "This standard provides specifications and guidance for the process of
    preparing natural capital accounts. Natural capital accounting is a systematic
    way of collating financial, socio-economic and environmental information about
    an organization’s impacts and dependencies on nature and presenting it in formats
    that are familiar to decision makers. Such accounts enable organizations to see
    all the information in one place, think about their impacts and dependencies in
    a holistic way, and prioritise ‘material impacts and dependencies’. The standard
    ensures the whole process is transparent by requiring the documentation of scope,
    data, assumptions, gaps and implications of all these on the way accounts are
    interpreted for decision making. \n\nThere are two key natural capital accounting
    outputs prescribed – each with supporting schedules: \n\na)\ta Natural Capital
    Balance Sheet (NCBS) shows an organization’s dependency on natural capital assets.
    It mimics a financial balance sheet so far as it shows the (natural capital) asset
    values and (natural capital maintenance) liabilities. The two key differences
    are that a NCBS (i) documents the asset values to the organization and the rest
    of the society, when financial accounts only show the former and (ii) is forward
    looking, i.e. projects and compares asset values and liabilities into the future,
    when financial accounts show past performance. \n\nThe NCBS can have two scopes:
    Scope 1 for the natural capital assets which the organization owns or has legal
    or voluntary responsibility and Scope 2 for natural capital assets owned by others.
    Assets that are not owned by anyone, e.g. public goods, might be included in Scope
    1 or Scope 2 depending on the organization and materiality of its impacts and
    dependencies. \n\nb)\ta Natural Capital Income Statement (NCIS) shows the organization’s
    impacts on natural capital assets. It mimics a financial income statement so far
    as it shows the positive impacts (the enhancements) and negative ones (degradations).
    Again, like its financial counterpart, NCIS looks at the past performance during
    the financial year to date. \n\nThe NCIS can have two scopes: Scope 1 for the
    impacts from the organization’s own operations and Scope 2 for the impacts attributed
    to the organization through the operations of its value chain.\n \nNatural capital
    accounting is a rare offer of holistic treatment of all data with focus on natural
    capital assets, such as water, forests, atmosphere, etc. as opposed to tools or
    approaches developed on a single-issue basis. It is a structure within which the
    outputs from all such tools and approaches can be gathered and interpreted together.
    \ Working within a natural capital accounting structure will help organizations
    identify and prioritise their data needs and select the most appropriate approaches
    that will support their decisions. \n\nNatural capital accounting will also help
    organizations align with the Taskforce for Climate related Financial Disclosures
    (TCFD), Taskforce for Nature related Financial Disclosures (TNFD), the future
    requirements from International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB), guidance
    from EFRAG for Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), and taxonomies
    developed for sustainable finance. \n\nThe target audience of a natural capital
    account is strategic and operational decision makers in organizations, in particular,
    accounting, finance, risk assessment and management professionals, and C-suite
    executives. Through its ability to bring all information together and make it
    relevant for the financial sustainability of an organization, natural capital
    accounting is capable of changing the understanding of nature for these decision
    makers from a regulatory burden, the cost of which needs to be minimised, to an
    asset to be invested in. It is this reframing that we must achieve if we want
    organizations to manage their impacts and dependencies for the sustainability
    of their finance, for nature, and society. \n\nNatural capital accounting, and
    hence this standard, is applicable to organizations of all types (public, third
    sector and listed and unlisted private) across all sectors, and of any size (such
    as SMEs and larger businesses) and is relevant to one or more sites in which they
    operate. A group of organizations dependent on the same natural capital assets,
    or considering collaborating to change their impacts, may produce joint natural
    capital accounts. This standard does not apply to national or sector-wide natural
    capital accounts, but its principles are aligned to those developed by the UN
    System of Environmental-Economic Accounting – Ecosystem Accounting (UN SEEA-EA)
    within the context of the System of National Accounts.\n\n \nThe preparation of
    natural capital accounts requires multidisciplinary teams including environmental
    and sustainability professionals, accountants, and economists, among others to
    help organizations embrace the complexity of nature without limiting the values
    of it to financial (cashflow) data."
