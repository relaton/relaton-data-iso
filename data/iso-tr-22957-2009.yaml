abstract:
- content: "ISO/TR 22957:2009 presents a recommended set of procedures and activities
    that are advisable when performing analysis, selection and implementation of project
    phases associated with electronic document management systems technologies. ISO/TR
    22957:2009 provides user-level information outlining specific recommended activities
    to be completed throughout the various project phases typically performed when
    implementing these technologies. It outlines the steps and activities, together
    with compliance with relevant industry standards and guidelines that need to be
    examined and “certified” to ensure relevant technologies have been analysed, designed,
    implemented and managed, ensuring document/record validity when used in a business
    or government environment. \nISO/TR 22957:2009 provides both user- and technical-level
    information and guidance detailing specific recommended activities and project
    tasks/phases recognized throughout the EDMS industry as being the EDMS industry
    best practice related to analysing business processes, evaluating appropriate/relevant
    technologies and ensuring complete technology implementation where required by
