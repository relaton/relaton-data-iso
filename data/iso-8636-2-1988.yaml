  content: Specifies the nomenclature used for the principal parts of the machine
    and the designation of the axes (in English, French and Russian and the equivalent
    terms in German and Italian) and the geometrical and practical tests for these
    milling machines, and gives the corresponding permissible deviations which apply
    to machines of general purpose use and normal accuracy. It deals only with the
    verification of the accuracy of the machine. It does not apply to the testing
    of the running of the machine nor to its characteristics which should generally
    be checked before the accuracy is tested.
