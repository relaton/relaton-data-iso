    ISO 14180:2017 provides guidance on methods for taking samples from coal seams in the ground, whether from exploration areas or tenements, or from operating underground or open-cut mines. The following methods are described:
    a)    sampling of small or large diameter holes;
    b)    drill cuttings sampling;
    c)    open-cut slot sampling;
    d)    adit, drift or shaft sampling;
    e)    pillar sampling;
    f)     channel sampling;
    g)    strip sampling.
    ISO 14180:2017 does not apply to sampling from moving streams in production or any other source of coal that is not in situ.
    Recommendations are made for selection and preparation of the sampling site, and methods are described for taking both small and bulk samples, and for preparing the samples for transport.
    NOTE          Annex A gives an example of a channel sample record form that can be used to record sampling and other relevant data, and ISO 13909 or ISO 18283 describes how to determine the mass of a representative sample at various nominal top sizes.
