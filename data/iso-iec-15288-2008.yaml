abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 15288:2008 establishes a common framework for describing the life
    cycle of systems created by humans. It defines a set of processes and associated
    terminology. These processes can be applied at any level in the hierarchy of a
    system's structure. Selected sets of these processes can be applied throughout
    the life cycle for managing and performing the stages of a system's life cycle.
    This is accomplished through the involvement of all interested parties, with the
    ultimate goal of achieving customer satisfaction. \nISO/IEC 15288:2008 also provides
    processes that support the definition, control and improvement of the life cycle
    processes used within an organization or a project. Organizations and projects
    can use these life cycle processes when acquiring and supplying systems. \nISO/IEC
    15288:2008 concerns those systems that are man-made and may be configured with
    one or more of the following: hardware, software, data, humans, processes (e.g.,
    processes for providing service to users), procedures (e.g., operator instructions),
    facilities, materials and naturally occurring entities. When a system element
    is software, the software life cycle processes documented in ISO/IEC 12207:2008
    may be used to implement that system element. \nISO/IEC 15288:2008 and ISO/IEC
    12207:2008 are harmonized for concurrent use on a single project or in a single
    organization."
