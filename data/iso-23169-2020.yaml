    This document specifies two on-site test methods (on-site cleanability [stain removal] and on-site wet-scrub resistance) for the evaluation of the quality assessment for interior wall coatings.
    These test methods are applicable to white coatings and light-coloured coatings of tristimulus value Y10 greater than 25 measured on a test specimen consisting of a coating applied to a black substrate.
    The cleanability test can differentiate the coating quality between 18 % of the pigment volume concentration (PVC) and the critical pigment volume concentration (CPVC). The on-site wet-scrub resistance test method can differentiate the coating quality when the PVC is nearly equal to the CPVC or above.
