    This document specifies:
    —     generic extensible data interchange formats for the representation of iris image data: a tagged binary data format based on an extensible specification in ASN.1 and a textual data format based on an XML schema definition that are both capable of holding the same information,
    —     examples of data record contents,
    —     application specific requirements, recommendations, and best practices in data acquisition, and
    —     conformance test assertions and conformance test procedures applicable to this document.
    The iris image information is stored as:
    —     an array of intensity values optionally compressed with ISO/IEC 15948 or ISO/IEC 15444-1, or
    —     an array of intensity values optionally compressed with ISO/IEC 15948 or ISO/IEC 15444-1 that can be cropped around the iris, with the iris at the centre, and which can incorporate region-of-interest masking of non-iris regions.
    This document also specifies elements of conformance testing methodology, test assertions, and test procedures, as applicable to this document.
    It establishes:
    —     test assertions pertaining to the structure of the iris image data format, as specified in Clauses 6, 7, 8 and 9 of this document,
    —     test assertions pertaining to internal consistency by checking the types of values that may be contained within each field, and
    —     semantic test assertions.
    The conformance testing methodology specified in this document does not establish:
    —     tests of other characteristics of biometric products or other types of testing of biometric products (e.g. acceptance, performance, robustness, security), or
    —     tests of conformance of systems that do not produce data records conforming to the requirements of this document.
    This document does not establish:
    —     requirements on the optical specifications of cameras, or
    —     requirements on photometric properties of iris images, or
    —    requirements on enrolment processes, workflow and use of iris equipment.
