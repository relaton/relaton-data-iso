    The management of electronic transport regulations (METR) provides a means for METR users to obtain trustworthy, authoritative, machine-interpretable, publicly available and transport-related information for the use of the road network, in order to provide safer and more efficient, sustainable, comfortable, and equitable transport services.
    The scope of METR includes both rules that are relatively static (e.g. static speed limits) as well as those that are dynamic (e.g. variable speed limits, signalized intersections). Where appropriate, METR incorporates existing documents (e.g. ISO/TS 19091 for signalized intersections).
    This document defines terms specific to the ISO 24315 series on the management of electronic transport regulations.
