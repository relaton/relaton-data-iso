    This document specifies a test method for determining the abrasion resistance of geotextiles and geotextile-related products under wet conditions. This document is applicable to geotextiles and geotextile-related products intended to be used as e.g. geo bags or filter beneath armourstone.
    The test method simulates abrasion impacts on geotextiles and geotextile-related products such as that caused by the movement of rocks in an embankment or transport of sediment in rivers.
    This document provides an index test which can be used for performance and acceptance testing. It can be used as performance test by comparison of mechanical and/or additional hydraulic properties before and after abrasion impact.
