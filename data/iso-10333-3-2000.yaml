    This part of 10333 specifies requirements, test methods, instructions for use and maintenance, marking, labelling and
    packaging, as appropriate, for self-retracting lifelines, including self-retracting lifelines that have an integral-rescue
    facility.
    Self-retracting lifelines are used as a connecting sub-system in personal fall-arrest systems (PFAS), which will be
    specified in a future International Standard (see ISO 10333-6 in the Bibliography), and are attached to anchor devices
    that are above the work place.
    This part of 10333 is applicable only to self-retracting lifelines limited to single-person use of a total mass not exceeding
    100 kg.
    NOTE Users of PFAS whose total mass (which includes attached tools and equipment) exceeds 100 kg are advised to
    seek advice from the equipment manufacturers regarding the suitability of the equipment, which may need additional testing to
    take into account the larger mass.
    This part of 10333 does not specify those additional requirements that would apply when self-retracting lifelines are
    subjected to special conditions of use (where, for example, there exist unusual limitations concerning access to the
    place of work and/or particular environmental factors). Thus treatments to ensure the durability of the materials of
    construction (such as heat treatment, anti-corrosion treatment, protection against physical and chemical hazards) are
    not specified in this part of 10333, but should comply with appropriate International Standards or, failing that, with
    national standards and other specifications dealing with relevant physical characteristics and/or the safety of users.
