  content: This document defines a reference architecture of knowledge engineering
    (KE) in artificial intelligence (AI). The reference architecture describes KE
    roles, activities, constructional layers, components and their relationships amongst
    themselves and other systems from systemic user and functional views. This document
    also provides a common KE vocabulary by defining KE terms.
