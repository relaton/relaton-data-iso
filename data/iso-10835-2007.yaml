abstract:
- content: "ISO 10835:2007 gives\nfor mechanical sampling, manual sampling and preparation
    of samples taken from a lot under transfer, to determine the chemical composition,
    moisture content and physical properties of the lot. \nThe methods specified in
    this International Standard are applicable to both the loading and discharging
    of direct reduced iron (DRI) and hot briquetted iron (HBI), by means of belt conveyors
    and other ore handling equipment to which a mechanical sampler may be installed
    or where stopped-belt sampling may safely be conducted. In this International
    Standard, DRI includes both reduced pellets and reduced lump ores."
