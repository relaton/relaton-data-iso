abstract:
- content: ISO 8239 specifies the fitting dimensions of needles and needle holders.
    It defines general terms for sewing machine needles and specifies the tolerances
    for their fit in the needle holder. In addition to the rangers of dimensions for
    the nominal shank diameter and the length from butt to eye, ISO 8239 also indicates
    the preferred combinations of these two dimensions. In order to ensure the interchangeability
    and to reduce the variety of needles these should serve as a guide when designing
    new sewing machines and/or sewing machine needles.
