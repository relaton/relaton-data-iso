    This document establishes a generally applicable (i.e. not application specific) definition for dispersibility. It identifies significant characteristics for evaluating dispersibility and lists examples of methods used to characterize dispersibility in various applications.
    This document applies to processes that disperse powders into a liquid continuous phase while reducing the size of agglomerates or flocs down to the intended level, that homogenize an existing dispersed solid phase of a suspension or the mixture of two suspensions, or that exchange the original continuous phase in a suspension for another. Specific methods to disperse particles and to characterize the state of dispersion and/or homogeneity are only referenced, if necessary, for context.
    This document is applicable to nano- and micro-sized particles across a range of product applications.
