    ISO/IEC PAS 16898:2012 specifies a designation system as well as the shapes and dimensions for secondary lithium-ion cells for integration into battery packs and systems used in electrically propelled road vehicles including the position of the terminals and any over-pressure safety device (OPSD). It is related to cylindrical, prismatic and pouch cells.
    The cell designation according to ISO/IEC PAS 16898:2012 is intended to be applied to the cells used for electrically propelled road vehicles. ISO/IEC PAS 16898:2012 does not apply to cells specifically used for mopeds, motorcycles and vehicles not primarily defined as road vehicles, i.e. material handling trucks or forklifts.
    The cell dimensions listed in ISO/IEC PAS 16898:2012 are recommended but not restricted for use in passenger cars up to 3,5 t.
    The inner design, the cell chemistry, the electrical characteristics and any further properties of the cells are not defined in ISO/IEC PAS 16898:2012.
