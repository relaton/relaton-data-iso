    This International Standard specifies the Wireless terminal call handling additional network features (ANF-WTMI,
    ANF-WTMO), which are applicable to various basic services supported by Private Integrated Services Networks
    (PISN). Basic services are specified in ISO/IEC 11574.
    Additional network feature Wireless terminal incoming call (ANF-WTMI) directs incoming calls to a WTMI user
    within a PISN regardless of the WTMI user's geographical location within the PISN, provided the WTMI user's
    location is known.
    Additional network feature Wireless terminal outgoing call (ANF-WTMO) detects an outgoing call from a WTMO
    user and establishes it as a basic call, regardless of the user's geographical location within the PISN. It also
    provides the WTMO user's service profile for use by outgoing call control, or alternatively passes the call to the
    WTMO user's home location for processing.
    Service specifications are produced in three stages, according to the method described in CCITT Recommendation
    I.130. This International Standard contains the stage 1 and stage 2 specifications of ANF-WTMI and ANF-WTMO.
    The stage 1 specification (clauses 6 and 7) specifies the service as seen by users of PISNs. The stage 2
    specification (clauses 8 and 9) identifies the functional entities involved in the service and the information flows
    between them.
