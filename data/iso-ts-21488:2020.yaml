  content: "This document specifies methods for exposing specimen to alternating outdoor
    weathering supported with artificial radiation. This method utilizes, as much
    as possible, the natural outdoor exposure which are then assisted by the artificial
    radiation during night time and in cloudy conditions. \nThis document is applicable
    to polyolefin materials as well as to products and portions of products.\nThe
    artificial and natural outdoor exposures and their practices applicable to this
    document are described in ISO 4892-1, ISO 4892-3 and ISO 877-1, ISO 877-2 and
    ISO 877-3, respectively."
