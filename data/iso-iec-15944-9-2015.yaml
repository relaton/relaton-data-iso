  content: "ISO/IEC 15944-9:2015 presents a framework consisting of several models,
    including a reference model, a model of concepts, a content model, an information
    model, as well as rules, templates and other technical specifications for traceability
    requirements based on internal or external constraints as applicable to a business
    transaction. The internal constraints are imposed in Open-edi due to mutual agreements
    among parties to a business transaction and the external constraints are invoked
    by the nature of a business transaction due to applicable laws, regulations, policies,
    etc. of jurisdictional domains which need to be considered in Open-edi business
    transactions. All requirements in ISO/IEC 15944-9:2015 originate from external
    constraints. However, parties to a business transaction may well by mutual agreement
    apply external constraints of this nature as internal constraints.\nThe focus
    therefore of this traceability framework standard is on commitment exchange among
    autonomous parties to a business transaction.\nAs such, this statement of scope
    includes the ability of the traceability framework to\n- specify a group of structured
    and inter-related concepts pertaining to traceability as a legal or regulatory
    requirement in the Open-edi context, in addition to concepts that appear in other
    Parts of ISO/IEC 15944 these concepts having the characteristics of cultural adaptability
    through the use of multilingual terms and definitions;\n- provide additional specifications
    for Open-edi scenarios and scenario components from the perspective of traceability
    as required by internal or external constraints in business transactions;\n- provide
    a more detailed specification for business transactions regarding aspects of traceability,
    including refined models of Person, Data and Process in support of the ability
    for Open-edi to incorporate elements or characteristics of traceability in its
    information bundles (including their semantic components) and business processes;
    \n- realize specifications and descriptions from the traceability requirements
    as rules and guidelines, to provide recommendations or guidance on Open-edi practices;
    and,\n- provide revised primitive Open-edi scenario templates for traceability,
    integrating the modifications to the template from other existing Parts of ISO/IEC
    15944.\nISO/IEC 15944-9:2015 can be used by Open-edi implementers (including business
    modellers and system designers) and Open-edi standard developers in specifying
    Open-edi scenarios, developing Open-edi related standards, and implementing Open-edi
    rules and guidelines for Open-edi activities."
