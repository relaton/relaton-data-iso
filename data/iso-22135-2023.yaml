    This document describes a method for calculating steady-state rollover threshold of heavy commercial vehicles and buses, not considering the effects of active control systems. The calculation method considers the main factors that influence the rollover threshold, namely the height of centre of gravity, the track, the tyre lateral stiffness, and all factors that affect the vehicle roll stiffness. The considered compliances (e.g. tyre deformation) have a considerable influence on the effective track, and consequently on the steady-state rollover threshold.
    NOTE         As an alternative to the described calculation method standard, the steady-state rollover threshold can be measured on a test track or with a tilt-table test as described in ISO 16333.
