    This International Standard specifies the physical and magnetic characteristics of an 8 mm wide magnetic tape cartridge to
    enable physical interchange of such cartridges between drives. It also specifies the quality of the recorded signals, the
    recording method and the recorded format called MammothTape-2, and thereby allowing data interchange between drives by
    means of such magnetic tape cartridges.
    Information interchange between systems also requires, at a minimum, agreement between the interchange parties upon the
    interchange code(s) and the specifications of the structure and labelling of the information on the interchanged cartridge.
