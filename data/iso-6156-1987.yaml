abstract:
- content: Specifies the requirements for a generalized format, the definition and
    layout of terminological/lexigraphological data on magnetic tape as well as the
    meaning and layout of the tags associated with each element.Describes an interchange
    principle between data processing systems. The annexes are examples which illustrate
    possible applications. Is designed for information exchange on magnetic tape and
    also meant to enable user implementing a set of mutually compatible data categories
    to interchange terminological/lexicographical information with the aid of data
    processing technique.
