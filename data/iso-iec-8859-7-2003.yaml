abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 8859 consists of several parts. Each part specifies a set of up
    to 191 graphic characters and the coded representation of these characters by
    means of a single 8-bit byte. Each set is intended for use for a particular group
    of languages.\nISO/IEC 8859-7:2003 specifies a set of 188 coded graphic characters
    identified as Latin/Greek alphabet. This set of coded graphic characters is intended
    for use in data and text processing applications and also for information interchange.
    The set contains graphic characters used for general purpose applications in typical
    office environments in at least the following languages: English, Greek, and Latin.\nThis
    set of coded graphic characters may be regarded as a version of an 8-bit code
    according to ISO/IEC 2022 or ISO/IEC 4873 at level 1. ISO/IEC 8859-7:2003 may
    not be used in conjunction with any other parts of ISO/IEC 8859. If coded characters
    from more than one part are to be used together, by means of code extension techniques,
    the equivalent coded character sets from ISO/IEC 10367, or their corresponding
    G1 sets from the ISO International Register of Coded Character Sets to be Used
    with Escape Sequences, should be used instead within a version of ISO/IEC 4873
    at level 2 or level 3. \nThe coded characters in this set may be used in conjunction
    with coded control functions selected from ISO/IEC 6429. However, control functions
    are not used to create composite graphic symbols from two or more graphic characters
    (see Clause 6). \nNOTE ISO/IEC 8859 is not intended for use with Telematic services
    defined by ITU-T. If information coded according to ISO/IEC 8859 is to be transferred
    to such services, it will have to conform to the requirements of those services
    at the access-point."
