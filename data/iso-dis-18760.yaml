abstract:
- content: This document specifies the delivery conditions for welded pipes of circular
    cross-section, made of high manganese austenitic steel, which are supplied for
    low temperature pressure purposes. This document is applicable to all pressure
    retaining components and any non-pressure retaining component, such as a member
    of a pipe support, welded directly to a pressure retaining component.
