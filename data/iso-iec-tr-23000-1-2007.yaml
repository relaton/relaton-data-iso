abstract:
- content: "MPEG-A facilitates the swift development of innovative, standards-based
    multimedia applications and services. To this end, the MPEG-A introduces a set
    of standardized Multimedia Application Formats (MAFs), together with their related
    software implementation. The normative software demonstrates how MAFs are used
    and offers vendors a head start for developing multimedia products based on MAFs.
    MPEG's ultimate objective for MAFs is to stimulate the increased use of MPEG technology
    through additional interoperability of different media types at the application
    level. Although in the past MPEG has specified profiles, subsets of technologies
    within specific parts of the standards, such as MPEG-2 Video, it has never recommended
    the use of specific combinations of profiles across different parts of a standard,
    such as MPEG-2 Audio and MPEG-2 Video, or across different standards, such as
    MPEG-4 and MPEG-7. It is this combination of technologies across MPEG standards
    which is the topic of MPEG-A.\nISO/IEC TR 23000-1:2007 contains a description
    of the original motivation for this new family of standards and the concept underlying
    the construction of all other parts (MAFs) of ISO/IEC 23000. Furthermore, it provides
    a short overview of all MAFs that have been standardized to date. "
