    used at airports for boarding and disembarkation of passengers on the types of civil transport aircraft which have been listed hereafter. These types of aircraft have a door sill height greater than 2,0 m (80 in) over the ground. Lower aircraft usually do not require such means of access, and have not been taken into account.
