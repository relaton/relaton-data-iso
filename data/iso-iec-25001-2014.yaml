    ISO/IEC 25001:2014 provides requirements and recommendations for an organization responsible for implementing and managing the systems and software product quality requirements specification and evaluation activities through the provision of technology, tools, experiences, and management skills.
    The role of the evaluation group includes motivating employees and training them for the requirements specification and the evaluation activities, preparing appropriate documents, identification or development of required methods, and responding to queries on relevant technologies.
    Technology management is related to the planning and management of a systems and software quality requirements specification and evaluation process, measurements and tools. This includes the management of development, acquisition, standardisation, control, transfer and feedback of requirements specification and evaluation technology experiences within the organisation.
    The intended users of ISO/IEC 25001:2014 are those responsible for:
    - managing technologies used for requirements specification and evaluation execution,
    - specifying systems and software product quality requirements,
    - supporting systems and software product quality evaluation,
    - managing systems and software development organisations,
    as well as those in a quality assurance function. However, it is also applicable to managers involved in other systems or software related activities.
