    This document establishes a uniform, safe and consistent approach to the technical training of personnel for the maintenance, thorough examination, operational testing, overhaul and repair of lifeboats and rescue boats, launching appliances and release gear.
    It also provides the necessary information for interested parties to grant authorization, effectively evaluate and audit training, supporting the IMO Requirements, section 3.
    It specifies the training requirements for the level 1 controlled environment education and technical training for personnel certified by a manufacturer or an authorized service provider to carry out maintenance, thorough examination, operational testing, overhaul and repair of lifeboats (including free-fall lifeboats) and rescue boats (including fast rescue boats), launching appliances and release gear.
    The level 1 training is split into two stages, both covered in this document:
    —    stage 1 service technician technical controlled environment education and training has five modules that consist of classroom-based theory followed by practical sessions. The five modules encompass the scope and range of technical knowledge and skills required to assume type-specific design coverage of survival craft, release systems, davits and winches. The modules focus on supporting the requirements in the IMO Requirements, section 8, paragraphs 8.1, 8.2.1.1 to 8.2.1.6, 8.2.2, and 8.2.3.
    —    stage 2 service technician technical controlled environment experience and assessment requires candidates to undertake a minimum of four supervised scenarios-based practical exercises assessments covering the range of type specific complete systems for which they will be certified.
    This document is intended to be used in conjunction with ISO 23678-1, ISO 23678-2 and ISO 23678-4.
    This document is applicable to the following types of lifeboats (including free-fall lifeboats), rescue boats (including fast rescue boats), launching appliances and release gear.
    Survival craft types:
    a) single fall totally enclosed lifeboats with sprinkler and air systems;
    b) twin fall totally enclosed lifeboats with sprinkler and air systems;
    c) partially enclosed lifeboats;
    d) tender lifeboats;
    e) freefall lifeboats;
    f) open lifeboat;
    g) inflatable rescue boats;
    h) rigid rescue boats;
    i) semi-ridged inflatable rescue boats;
    j) rigid fast rescue boats;
    k) rigid inflatable fast rescue boats.
    Survival craft propulsion system types:
    a) inboard diesel engines;
    b) outboard engines;
    c) propeller drives;
    d) jet drives.
    Davit types:
    a) gravity single and twin fall outrigger;
    b) hydraulic single pivoting/luffing;
    c) hydraulic multi pivot/luffing;
    d) telescopic;
    e) gravity roller track;
    f) gravity free fall primary;
    g) free fall hydraulic secondary;
    h) A-frame hydraulic;
    i) single arm slewing (manual, electric);
    j) davits with stored power systems.
    Winch types:
    a) twin drum;
    b) single drum;
    c) gravity-lowering, electric hoisting;
    d) gravity-lowering hydraulic hoisting;
    e) hydraulic hoisting and lowering.
    Hook release system types:
    a) on-load/off load (load not over centre);
    b) on-load/offload (load over centre);
    c) off load;
    d) freefall hydraulic;
    e) automatic off load.
