abstract:
- content: "The human information data model for VR-based smart cities is defined
    to represent human-related information in 3D virtual environments. It defines
    concepts, a data model, and how to integrate 3D virtual worlds and information
    related to sensors that people carry with them. It defines an exchangeable information
    data model necessary for transferring and storing human information in 3D virtual
    smart cities. \n\nThis document will specify:\n•\tRepresentation of human information
    in a 3D virtual smart city\n•\tRepresentation of human information with sensors
    in a 3D virtual smart city\n•\tRepresentation of human semantic and physiological
    information for a 3D virtual smart city\n•\tDefinition of an interchangeable data
    model for human information for a VR smart city"
