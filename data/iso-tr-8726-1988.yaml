  content: This Technical Report specifies a method for determining transient response
    behaviour at approximately constant speed. The quasi-open-loop manoeuvre used
    in this method is not representative of real driving conditions but is useful
    in obtaining measures of vehicle transient behaviour in terms that will be enable
    the response to any deterministic input to be calculated. Applies to passenger
    cars as defined in ISO 3833. In a simplified form this test method is also specified
    in ISO 7401 together with alternative and complementary procedures.
