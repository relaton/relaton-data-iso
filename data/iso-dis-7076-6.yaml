    ISO 7076-6:2016 specifies requirements for compressed air foam systems (CAFS) in which foam concentrate and compressed air are continuously added to the water being discharged from the fire-fighting pump. This part of ISO 7076 is applicable to CAFS that can be permanently installed in fire-fighting vehicles, transportable, or mobile.
    ISO 7076-6:2016 specifies requirements for CAFS which are used at ambient temperatures ranging from ?10 째C to +40 째C.
    ISO 7076-6:2016 does not apply to stationary CAFS.
    ISO 7076-6:2016 does not apply to requirements for hazards related to handling foam concentrates, noise generated by CAFS, drives, auxiliary equipment, power sources, or pumps connected to the CAFS.
    ISO 7076-6:2016 does not specify requirements for special hazards arising from particular conditions under which CAFS are used, for example:
    - immunity against electromagnetic fields and electrostatic discharge;
    - operation without supervision;
    - events specific to the location where the CAFS is set up (e.g. on public roads);
    - handling of any equipment, devices, etc., which have to be connected to the CAFS or are joined to it (e.g. branch pipes, nozzles and pressure hoses);
    - decommissioning and disposal.
