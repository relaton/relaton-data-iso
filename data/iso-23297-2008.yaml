    ISO 23297:2008 specifies requirements for eight classes and two types (construction with adhesive bond between layers and construction without adhesive bond between layers) of wire or synthetic yarn reinforced hydraulic hoses and hose assemblies of nominal size from 3,2 to 31,5. Each class has a single maximum working pressure for all sizes. Such hoses are suitable for use with hydraulic fluids HH, HL, HM, HR, and HV as defined in ISO 6743-4 at temperatures ranging from -40 °C to +100 °C for grades A and B and -40 °C to +120 °C for grades C and D.
    ISO 23297:2008 does not include requirements for end fittings. It is limited to the performance of hoses and hose assemblies. The hose assembly maximum working pressure is governed by the lowest maximum working pressure of the components.
