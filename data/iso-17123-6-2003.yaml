  content: "ISO 17123-6:2003 specifies field procedures to be adopted when determining
    and evaluating the precision (repeatability) of rotating lasers and their ancillary
    equipment when used in building and surveying measurements for levelling tasks.
    Primarily, these tests are intended to be field verifications of the suitability
    of a particular instrument for the immediate task at hand and to satisfy the requirements
    of other standards. They are not proposed as tests for acceptance or performance
    evaluations that are more comprehensive in nature. \nThese field procedures have
    been developed specifically for in situ applications without the need for special
    ancillary equipment and are purposefully designed to minimize atmospheric influences."
