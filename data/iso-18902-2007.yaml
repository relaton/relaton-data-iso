    ISO 18902:2007 specifies the principal physical and chemical requirements for filing enclosures, containers, albums and frames, particularly designed for storing wet or dry processed films, plates and papers. It covers requirements for paper and board, plastic, metal, adhesives (except spray adhesives), writing, labelling and printing materials. It is applicable to photographs made with hardcopy materials. Included are photographs made with traditional chromogenic (“silver-halide”) and silver dye bleach photographic materials, dye- and pigment-based inkjet, dye diffusion thermal transfer (“dye sublimation”), liquid- and dry-toner electrophotography, and other analogue and digital print processes.
    ISO 18902:2007 applies to storage copies and does not include work copies. It applies to visual records for extended-term preservation and to visual records for preservation for moderate periods of time. The requirements are limited to the characteristics that may affect the enclosed item chemically or physically when it is stored under recommended conditions.
