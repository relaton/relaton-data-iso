    This Technical Report describes a set of key characteristics to achieve interoperability and compatibility in trusted
    health information interchange between communicant application systems.
    The key characteristics describe inter-application interoperability needs of the healthcare community, in particular
    the subject of care, the healthcare professional/caregiver, the healthcare provider organization, its business units
    and the integrated delivery network.
    The key characteristics offer criteria for standards developers and implementers of standards for messaging and
    communications in the healthcare domain and provide a guide for software developers and vendors, healthcare
    providers and end users.
