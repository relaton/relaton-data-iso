abstract:
- content: 'ISO/TR 21730:2007 provides guidance for the deployment, use and management
    of mobile wireless communication and computing equipment in healthcare facilities
    in a way that promotes effective electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) among the
    wireless technology and active medical devices through mitigation of potential
    hazards due to electromagnetic interference (EMI). The recommendations given recognize
    the different resources, needs, concerns and environments of healthcare organizations
    around the world, and provide detailed management guidelines for healthcare organizations
    that desire full deployment of mobile wireless communication and computing technology
    throughout their facilities. In addition, suggestions are included for selective
    restrictions in cases where healthcare organizations have decided that comprehensive
    management procedures are not feasible, practical or desirable at the present
    time. The recommendations herein distinguish between wireless technology controlled
    by the facility and used by doctors and staff for healthcare-specific communication
    and health informatics transport versus non-controlled (personal) mobile wireless
    equipment randomly brought into the facility by visitors, patients or the healthcare
    organization workforce. '
