  content: "ISO 20289:2018 provides a chemical method for technicians working with
    Total Reflection X-ray Fluorescence (TXRF) instrumentation to perform measurements
    of water samples, according to good practices, with a defined degree of accuracy
    and precision. Target users are identified among laboratories performing routine
    analysis of large numbers of samples, which also comply with ISO/IEC 17025.\nISO
    20289:2018 specifies a method to determine the content of elements dissolved in
    water (for example, drinking water, surface water and ground water). Taking into
    account the specific and additionally occurring interferences, elements can also
    be determined in waste waters and eluates. Sampling, dilution and pre-concentration
    methods are not included in this document.\nElements that can be determined with
    the present method may change according to the X-ray source of the instrument.
    No health, safety or commercial aspects are considered herewith.\nThe working
    range depends on the matrix and the interferences encountered. In drinking water
    and relatively unpolluted waters, the limit of quantification lies between 0,001
    mg/l and 0,01 mg/l for most of the elements. The working range typically covers
    concentrations between 0,001 mg/l and 10 mg/l, depending on the element and predefined
    requirements. \nAnnex B reports, for example, the complete validation of the method
    of TXRF analysis of water performed with instrumentation that has Mo as the X-ray
    source and uses Ga as the internal standard for calibration.\nQuantification limits
    of most elements are affected by blank contamination and depend predominantly
    on the laboratory air-handling facilities available, on the purity of reagents
    and the cleanliness of labware."
