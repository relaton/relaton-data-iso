  content: "This document specifies the characteristics of the fitness for purpose
    of oriented unplasticized poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC-O) solid wall piping intended
    to be used underground or above-ground where protected from direct sunlight, for
    water supply, buried drainage, sewerage, treated wastewater and irrigation under
    pressure. It also specifies the test parameters for the test methods referred
    to in this document.\nThis document is not intended for on-site testing of pipe
    systems.\nIn conjunction with ISO 16422-1, ISO 16422-2, ISO/TS 16422-3 and ISO
    1452-3, this document is applicable to PVC-O pipes and PVC-O fittings, as well
    as to their joints and to joints with components of other plastics and non-plastics
    materials intended to be used for the following:\na)       water mains and services
    lines;\nb)       conveyance of water for both outside and inside buildings;\nc)       
    drainage, sewerage and treated wastewater under pressure;\nd)       irrigation
    under pressure.\nThis document is applicable to piping systems intended for the
    supply of water under pressure up to and including 25 °C (cold water), intended
    for human consumption and for general purposes as well as for wastewater under
    pressure. \nThis document is also applicable to components for the conveyance
    of water and wastewater up to and including 45 °C. For temperatures between 25 °C
    and 45 °C, see ISO 16422-2:2023, Figure C.1.\nThe piping system according to this
    document is intended for the conveyance of cold water up to pressures of 25 bar[1]
    and especially in those applications where special performance requirements are
    needed, such as impact loads and pressure fluctuations, up to pressure of 25 bar."
