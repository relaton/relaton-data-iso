    This part of ISO 10303 specifies the interpretation of the integrated resources to satisfy requirements for
    the definition of the hierarchical structure of drawings and the administration information to manage
    drawings and relate a product to the drawing.
    The following are within the scope of this part of ISO 10303:
    — the structures for representing a drawing that depicts any phase of design;
    — the structures for representing individual drawing revisions;
    — the hierarchical structure of drawings, drawing sheets, and views of the draughting shape model;
    — the administrative data used for the purpose of drawing management;
    — the administrative data identifying the product versions being documented by the drawing.
    The following are outside the scope of this part of ISO 10303:
    — the structures for representing drawings that are not related to a product;
    — the exchange of drawing history;
    NOTE - Drawing history refers to prior drawing revisions.
    — the exchange of data used exclusively for the creation of paper or hard copy versions of the drawing;
    EXAMPLE - Printer or plotter data can be pen designations, plot scale, or plot color specifications.
