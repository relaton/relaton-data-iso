    This document specifies requirements and recommendations for the digital test file content, printer setups and printing procedures that are used to generate target prints for test method standards and specifications for image stability in the context of reflection colour photographic prints.
    Furthermore, this document defines measurement procedures of the test patches as well as how changes of colour attributes are calculated in the course of a given image stability test.
    Definition of the statistical procedure for data reduction and the translation of those changes into psychophysical end point levels does not belong to the scope of this document, but results obtained with the methods defined in this document can feed into the appropriate statistical evaluation and end point systems of a print life specification defined in other documents.
