    This document describes methods of specifying and evaluating the manipulation performance of service robots, notably:
    —    grasp size;
    —    grasp strength;
    —    grasp slip resistance;
    —    opening a hinged door; and
    —    opening a sliding door.
    There are other grasping characteristics and use cases for manipulation of service robots. It is expected that these will be included in a future revision.
    This document deals with the indoor environment only. However, the depicted tests can also be applicable for robots operating in outdoor environments.
    This document is not applicable for the verification or validation of safety requirements.
