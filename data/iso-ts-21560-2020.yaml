- content: |-
    This document specifies general requirements for tissue-engineered medical products (TEMPs), which are used in regenerative medicine. With regard to safety, this document outlines requirements for materials, manufacture, quality control, and unintentional biological effects elicited by TEMPs. This document does not address requirements for clinical trials and efficacy.
    This document is not applicable to tissue-engineered products used for diagnosis, ex-vivo testing or extracorporeal treatments of patients (e.g. dialysis with TEMP components). TEMPs containing viable xenogenic cells, genetically modified cells, or cells derived from abnormal cells or tissues (e.g. cancerous tissues) are also excluded from the scope. The combination of TEMPs with medical devices, with the exception of scaffolds comprised of synthetic and/or naturally-derived (e.g. animal sourced) materials, is also excluded from the scope.
    NOTE    International, national or regional regulations or requirements, or the Pharmacopeia also apply to specific topics covered in this document.
