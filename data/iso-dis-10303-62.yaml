abstract:
- content: "The scope is equivalence validation of product data. Product data may
    travel between two or more IT systems during design and manufacturing processes.
    Data translation is applied as necessary during that travel. Or product data may
    be reused after long-term data retention. \nIn these scenarios, validation of
    whether or not translated product data can be regarded as equivalent to the product
    data before translation plays a key role in confirming usability of the translated
    product data. Equivalence validation of product data is beneficial for all types
    of manufacturers. Therefore, this work will add value to the existing SC 4 standards.\nThe
    target data of equivalence validation in the current edition is limited to exact
    Brep shape data and assembly data. This edition expands the target data types
    to triangulated shape data, PMI data, and display attributes such as color and
    transparency. These enhancements correspond to common demands of manufacturing
    industries such as the automotive industry, aerospace industry, electric/electronic
    industry, and other manufacturing industries.\nTriangulated shape data is often
    generated from Brep data for purposes such as lightweight visualization. Equivalence
    validation between the derived triangulated shape data and the original Brep data
    is important to guarantee reliability of the derived data, but it is not supported
    by the current standard.\nDemands for both graphical and semantic PMI data are
    increasing in any industry utilizing mechanical 3D CAD. There is a draft standard
    for equivalence validation of graphical PMI data. This project will complete the
    draft document and will also develop standards for semantic PMI data.\nColor and
    transparency are used not only for visualization but also to convey various semantics,
    such as manufacturing methods, tolerance information, and so on. Although the
    usage is often based on local rules, representation of these display attributes
    in STEP AP242 is established now and they are important in many use cases. Equivalence
    validation of color and transparency will increase the reliability of CAD data
    in many use cases."
