    This document describes and classifies a range of laboratory ignition sources for use in fire tests on plastics and products consisting substantially of plastics. These sources vary in intensity and area of impingement. They are suitable for use to simulate the initial thermal abuse to which plastics are potentially exposed in certain actual fire risk scenarios.
    This compilation of standard ignition sources describes the ignition sources used by different standards development organizations and contained in standard test methods, specifications, or regulations used to assess the fire properties or plastics and of products containing plastic materials. The ignition sources described in this document are associated with flaming and non-flaming ignition. This document describes the relevant ignition sources and references the associated standard.
    This compilation of ignition sources does not discuss the application of the standard referenced in any specific clause in which the ignition source is described, and this compilation is likely not to be a fully comprehensive list of ignition sources.
    This document does not address detailed test procedures.
