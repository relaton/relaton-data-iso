    This document specifies a method of determining the antibacterial effectiveness of open-cell flexible cellular polymeric antibacterial treated materials, including their intermediate and final products.
    This document is suitable for flexible cellular polymeric materials because the test procedure enables the test inoculum to efficiently contact with the surface of open cell in the flexible cellular polymeric materials.
