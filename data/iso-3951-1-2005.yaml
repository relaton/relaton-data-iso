  content: "ISO 3951-1:2005 specifies an acceptance sampling system of single sampling
    plans for inspection by variables, in which the acceptability of a lot is implicitly
    determined from an estimate of the percentage of nonconforming items in the process,
    based on a random sample of items from the lot.\nISO 3951-1:2005 is primarily
    designed for application under the following conditions: \nwhere the inspection
    procedure is to be applied to a continuing series of lots of discrete products
    all supplied by one producer using one production process; \nwhere only a single
    quality characteristic x of these products is taken into consideration, which
    must be measurable on a continuous scale; \nwhere the measurement error is negligible,
    i.e. with a standard deviation no more than 10% of the process standard deviation;
    \nwhere production is stable (under statistical control) and the quality characteristic
    x is distributed according to a normal distribution or a close approximation to
    the normal distribution; \nwhere a contract or standard defines an upper specification
    limit U, a lower specification limit L, or both; \nan item is qualified as conforming
    if and only if its measured quality characteristic x satisfies the appropriate
    one of the following inequalities:\nx greater than or equal to L (i.e. the lower
    specification limit is not violated);\nx less than or equal to U (i.e. the upper
    specification limit is not violated);\nx greater than or equal to L and x less
    than or equal to U  (i.e. neither the lower nor the upper specification limit
    is violated).\nThe first two inequalities are called cases with a single specification
    limit, and the third a case with double specification limits.\nIf double specification
    limits apply, it is assumed in ISO 3951-1:2005 that conformance to both specification
    limits is equally important to the integrity of the product; in such cases it
    is appropriate to apply a single AQL to the combined percentage of product outside
    the two specification limits. This is referred to as combined control. "
