    This document specifies the design and specification of on-screen keyboards (keyboards that are displayed on a screen) with direct touch interface, including those with some audio feedback.
    This document specifies keyboard layouts designed for on-screen keyboards with direct touch interface and ways for interaction with them.
    It is not applicable to virtual keyboards that are not displayed on a screen, and on-screen keyboards that do not provide a direct touchscreen interface such as on-screen keyboards relying on an accessory unit like a trackpad or a remote control for interactions with the user.
    It is not applicable to physical keyboards that use real or adaptable keys, which can be customized to user needs, for example, with LCD display.
