    This document applies to hydraulic cylinders that are part of the load carrying structure of cranes. It is intended to be used together with the ISO 8686 series and ISO 20332, and as such they specify general conditions, requirements and methods to prevent mechanical hazards of hydraulic cylinders, by design and theoretical verification.
    This document does not apply to hydraulic piping, hoses, connectors and valves used with the cylinders, or cylinders made from other material than (carbon) steel.
