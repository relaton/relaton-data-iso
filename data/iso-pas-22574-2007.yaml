  content: 'Friction linings are composite materials with complex structure. Due to
    their composition and their production process, visual appearance characteristics
    can occur which in a precisely defined design are to be regarded as specific to
    the product. ISO/PAS 22574:2007 defines visual aspect for the identification and
