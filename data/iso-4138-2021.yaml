    This document specifies open-loop test methods for determining the steady-state circular driving behaviour of passenger cars as defined in ISO 3833 and of light trucks, such behaviour being one of the factors comprising vehicle dynamics and road-holding properties. The open-loop manoeuvres included in these methods are not representative of real driving conditions, but are nevertheless useful for obtaining measures of vehicle steady-state behaviour resulting from several specific types of control inputs under closely controlled test conditions.
