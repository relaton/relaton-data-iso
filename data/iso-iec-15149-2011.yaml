abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 15149:2011 specifies the physical layer and media access control
    layer protocols of a wireless network over a magnetic field in a low frequency
    band (~300 kHz), for wireless communication in harsh environments (i.e. around
    metal, underwater, underground, etc.). \nThe physical layer protocol is designed
    for the following scope:\n- low carrier frequency for large magnetic field area
    and reliable communication in harsh environments;\n- simple and robust modulation
    for a low implementation cost and error performance;\n- variable coding and bandwidth
    for a link adaptation.\nThe media access control layer protocol is designed for
    the following scope:\n- simple and efficient network topology for low power consumption;\n-
    variable superframe structure for compact and efficient data transmission;\n-
    dynamic address assignment for small packet size and efficient address management.\nISO/IEC
    15149:2011 supports several kbps data transmission in a wireless network within
    a distance of several metres. It can be applied to various services such as the
    following areas:\n- in the environmental industry, to manage pollution levels
    in soil and water using wireless underground or underwater sensors; \n- in the
    construction industry, to monitor the integrity of buildings and bridges using
    wireless, inner-corrosion sensors;\n- in the consumer-electronics industry, to
    detect food spoilage in wet, airtight storage areas and to transfer the sensing
    data from the inside to the outside;\n- in the agricultural industry, to manage
    the moisture level as well as mineral status in soil using buried wireless sensors;\n-
    in the transportation industry, to manage road conditions and traffic information
    using wireless underground sensors."
