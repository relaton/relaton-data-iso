abstract:
- content: This document describes test methods using an integrating sphere to measure
    the optical properties of ceramic phosphor powders, which are used in white light-emitting
    diodes (LEDs) and emit visible light when excited by UV or blue light. It specifies
    an absolute method to measure internal quantum efficiency and a substitution method
    to measure external quantum efficiency and absorptance. The substitution method
    uses reference materials whose external quantum efficiency and absorptance have
    been obtained in accordance with ISO 23946.
