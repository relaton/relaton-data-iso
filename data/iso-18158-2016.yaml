    ISO 18158:2016 specifies terms and definitions that are related to the assessment of workplace exposure (see 2.1.5.1) to chemical and biological agents (see 2.1.1.1). These are either general terms or are specific to physical and chemical processes of air sampling, the analytical method (see 2.3.3), or method performance.
    The terms included are those that have been identified as being fundamental because their definition is necessary to avoid ambiguity and ensure consistency of use.
    ISO 18158:2016 is applicable to all International Standards, ISO Technical Reports, ISO Technical Specifications, and ISO Guides related to workplace atmospheres.
