    This document provides requirements for the biobanking of helminths as parasitic resources including the collection, safeguarding, classification, proliferation, preservation, storage and distribution of helminths.
    This document sets requirements for the quality of helminths and their associated data, the data collection, and safety management when handling the helminths as a source of human disease infection.
    This document is applicable to all organizations performing biobanking with helminths used for research and development.
    NOTE            International, national or regional regulations or requirements, or multiple of them, can also apply to specific topics covered in this document.
