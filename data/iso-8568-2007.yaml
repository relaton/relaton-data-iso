    ISO 8568:2007 specifies performance parameters and methods of inspection of mechanical shock-testing machines and gives guidelines for describing their characteristics. It is intended to ensure that the potential user of a particular shock-testing machine is provided with an adequate description of the characteristics of the machine, and also to give guidance on the selection of such machines.
    ISO 8568:2007 is applicable to the shock-testing machines that are used for demonstrating or evaluating the effect of shock conditions representative of the service environment and also for diagnostic testing. The purpose of the shock test is to reveal mechanical weakness and/or degradation in specified performance. It can also be used to determine the structural integrity of a test specimen or as a means of quality control.
    Machines used for simulation of earthquakes, sonic booms, explosions and implosions, bursting tests, metalworking, forming, etc. are not covered in ISO 8568:2007.
