    ISO 19924:2017 provides guidance for test providers and interested parties to implement acoustic tests of aerospace systems, subsystems, modules and units for applicable spacecraft programs. ISO 19924:2017 specifies a framework to meet test and process requirements and acts as a supplement to ISO 15864.
    The acoustic test system, the technical requirements and the procedures for acoustic tests in reverberant chambers are described. Furthermore, the criteria for the manual test interruption and evaluation are also described.
    The technical requirements in ISO 19924:2017 can be tailored to fulfil the objectives of tests.
