    This document specifies a test method to measure the repellency, retention and penetration of a known volume of liquid pesticide when applied to a protective clothing material. No external hydrostatic or mechanical pressure is applied to the test specimen during or after the application of the liquid pesticide.
    The degree of contamination depends on numerous factors such as the type of exposure, application technique, and pesticide formulation. As the level of exposure can vary considerably, this method is designed to rate the relative performance of personal protective equipment (PPE) materials at two levels of contamination. Low level of contamination is achieved by applying 0,1 ml of liquid formulation and high level by applying 0,2 ml.
    This test method does not measure the resistance to permeation or degradation.
    This test method is suitable for field strength and concentrated pesticide formulations. This method may not be suitable for testing protective clothing materials against volatile pesticide formulations.
    This document is applicable to the evaluation of materials that are new or those that have undergone treatment such as laundering or simulated abrasion. Details of the treatment shall be reported. This test method can also be used to determine the resistance provided by protective clothing materials against penetration of new pesticide formulations.
