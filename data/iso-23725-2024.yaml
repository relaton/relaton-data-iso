abstract:
- content: |-
    This document defines the interfaces required between the fleet management (FMS) and autonomous haulage (AHS) systems for dispatch of haul trucks and coordination of production information, including communication protocols, message structures, telemetry signals, map sharing and task assignments.
    This document applies to surface mining. It specifies requirements and recommendations to achieve the following:
    —     realtime computer system communication;
    —     message definition and semantic;
    —     mine map sharing;
    —     truck dispatching;
    —     truck production monitoring.
    This document does not address computer system authentication, authorization and cyber security. These methods and technologies are already covered by best practice IT deployments.
    The specific requirements for safe operation of machines, including execution of task assignments issued by the FMS to the AHS rely on additional information that is agreed between the FMS and AHS supplier which is outside the scope of this document.
