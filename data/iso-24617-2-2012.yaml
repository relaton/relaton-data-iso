  script: Latn
  content: "ISO 24617-2:2012 provides a set of empirically and theoretically well-motivated
    concepts for dialogue annotation, a formal language for expressing dialogue annotations
    -- the dialogue act markup language (DiAML) -- and a method for segmenting a dialogue
    into semantic units. This allows the manual or automatic annotation of dialogue
    segments with information about the communicative actions which the participants
    perform by their contributions to the dialogue. It supports multidimensional annotation,
    in which units in dialogue are viewed as having multiple communicative functions.
    The DiAML language has an XML-based representation format and a formal semantics
    which makes it possible to apply inference to DiAML representations. \nISO 24617-2:2012
    specifies data categories for reference sets of communicative functions and dimensions
    of dialogue analysis and provides principles and guidelines for extending these
    sets or selecting coherent subsets of them. Additionally, it provides guidelines
    for annotators and annotated examples. It is applicable to spoken, written and
    multimodal dialogues involving two or more participants."
