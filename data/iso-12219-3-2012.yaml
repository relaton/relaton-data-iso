    ISO 12219-3:2012 specifies a fast, qualitative and semiquantitative screening method for vapour-phase organic compounds (volatile and some semi-volatile) released from vehicle trim materials under simulated real-use conditions using micro-scale test chambers. This method is intended for evaluating new car interior trim components but can, in principle, also be applied to used car components.
    Target analytes include VOCs (conventionally defined as organic compounds in the volatility range of n-hexane to n-hexadecane) and volatile carbonyl compounds such as formaldehyde. The specified analytical procedure for VOCs is ISO 16000‑6 and for formaldehyde and some other light carbonyl compounds is ISO 16000‑3.
    ISO 12219-3:2012 provides third party test laboratories and manufacturing industry with a cost-effective approach for: a) monitoring and screening VOC emissions as part of routine quality control; b) monitoring product uniformity or conformity between formal certification tests; c) comparing emissions from products within a range (e.g. different colours or patterns); d) evaluating prototype, "low-emission" materials or products during development.
