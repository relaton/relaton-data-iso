  content: "This document specifies requirements for a HR management system when an
    organization needs to:\n\n—\tcreate stakeholder value through effective application
    of the HR management system, including the attraction, development and deployment
    of workers, continual improvement and integration of the system into the organization’s
    overall management system;\n—\tdemonstrate its ability to consistently manage
    its workers in a way that contributes to meeting stakeholder needs, including
    the achievement of organizational objectives and consideration of the needs of
    workers and employers.\n\nThis document is applicable to organizations of all
    sizes, growth phases and sectors, whether public or private, for profit or not
    for profit. This document does not determine the organization’s strategies and
    objectives. \n\nThis document does not serve to replace or make superfluous the
    instruments of agreed collective co-determination, most prominently that of collective
    bargaining, as established and protected by law in many jurisdictions and practised
    in good tradition by social partners, such as employers and workers´ unions and
    their respective associations."
