    This European Standard specifies a calculation method to determine the energy balance value of glazing. This
    European Standard applies to transparent materials such as glass and combinations of glass used to glaze
    windows in buildings.
    This method is intended to evaluate the balance of heat loss and useful heat gain by solar radiation entering the
    building through the glazing for a given period by means of an average rate of loss (or gain) of heat called the
    energy balance value.
    The method enables producers to compare the performance of their glazing products. The energy balance value
    should not be used for energy use or heating capacity calculations in buildings.
