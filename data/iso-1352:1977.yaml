abstract:
- content: The tests are carried out at room temperature, in air, by applying to the
    test piece a pure couple about its longitudinal axid. Test piece diameters are
    between 5 mm and 12,5 mm. The proparation, form and testing of test pieces of
    circular cross-section are specified. Does not specify component testing and high
    strain torsional fatigue tests, which lead to failure in a few thousand cycles.
