abstract:
- content: |-
    This document specifies characteristics to be measured of nanostructured porous alumina in powder form as catalyst support for vehicle exhaust emission control and their relevant measurement methods. It includes critical characteristics that are required to be measured and additional characteristics that are recommended to be measured, based upon agreement between the interested parties. Measurement methods for each characteristic are recommended.
    This document is applicable to nanostructured porous alumina for gasoline-powered cars. It does not apply to characteristics specific for health, the environment and safety issues.
