    ISO/IEC 15944-7:2009 provides a consolidated vocabulary of eBusiness concepts as found and defined in ISO/IEC 14662 and the existing parts of ISO/IEC 15944, namely, Parts 1, 2, 4, 5, 6 and 7 along with their associated terms.
    ISO/IEC 15944-7:2009 provides the rules, guidelines and procedures governing the formation of definitions for concepts relevant to eBusiness and choice of terms as a single, harmonized and integrated controlled vocabulary. This includes those governing multilingual expandability which incorporates and integrates cultural capability.
    As such, ISO/IEC 15944-7:2009 facilitates the production of human interface equivalents (HIEs) of eBusiness terms and definitions in the various official (and de facto) languages of ISO members.
    ISO/IEC 15944-7:2009 identifies the essential elements of an entry in this controlled vocabulary as well as their rules and specifications. It also includes rules for ensuring quality and integrity control requirement for each entry and the interworking among the entries while doing so in an IT-enabled manner. It also addresses maintenance and update procedures.
    ISO/IEC 15944-7:2009 is built on ISO/IEC 14662 and the existing Parts 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 of ISO/IEC 15944. The exclusions which apply to one or more of these International Standards apply to ISO/IEC 15944-7:2009
    ISO/IEC 15944-7:2009 does not currently support the following requirements (in no particular order):
    It is anticipated that some or all of these requirements will be addressed in future editions of this part of ISO/IEC 15944, in companion International Standards, or in Technical Reports.
    ISO/IEC 15944-7:2009 does not assume nor endorse any specific system environment, database management system, database design paradigm, system development methodology, data definition language, command language, system interface, user interface, syntax, computing platform, or any technology required for implementation , i.e. it is information technology neutral. At the same time, ISO/IEC 15944-7:2009 maximizes an IT-enabled approach to its implementation and maximizes semantic interoperability.
