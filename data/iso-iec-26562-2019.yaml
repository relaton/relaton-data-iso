    This document, within the context of methods and tools for supporting the transitioning the organization's current development approach to software and systems product line engineering:
    —     defines processes for product line transition management. Those processes are described in terms of purpose, inputs, tasks and outcomes;
    —     defines method capabilities to support the defined tasks of each process;
    —     defines tool capabilities that automate or semi-automate tasks and methods.
    This document does not concern processes and capabilities of tools and methods for a single system but rather deals with those for a family of products.
