    This document identifies the architecture of a toll system environment in which a toll charger (TC) can act to support traffic management with the use of a tariff scheme.
    This document defines:
    —     the architecture relevant to the scope of this document;
    —     a standard framework and data flow model;
    —     an exchange of information between a TC and a road and traffic manager (RTM), e.g.:
    —   level of service (LOS);
    —   tariff scheme;
    —   data which is needed to support traffic management (vehicle probe and traffic flow data).
    The detailed definitions of mandatory and optional elements in real implementation are outside the scope of this document. This document does not define communication stacks or timings.
