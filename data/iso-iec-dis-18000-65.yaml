  content: "This document defines the air interface based on ISO/IEC 18000-63 for
    radio frequency identification (RFID) devices operating in the 860 MHz to 930
    MHz used in sensing as well as item management applications. \nThis document specifies
    the physical and logical requirements for a passive-backscatter Interrogator-Talks-First
    (ITF) systems. The system comprises Interrogators, also known as readers, and
    tags with stream sensors. A stream sensor comprises, at least, a tag, which exploits
    the backscatter technology to establish the tag-to-interrogator link, and an optional
    digital sensor. If a stream sensor involves a digital sensor, the tag provides
    a unique identification number for the digital sensor as well as working as a
    wireless modem between the interrogator and the digital sensor. Depending on the
    usage of the system, the interrogator may process, store and pass-through the
    received data from the tag. General functions as an item management application,
    specifically inventory, reading and writing tags, are utilizing functionality
    defined in ISO/IEC 18000-63.\nThis document specifies\n— logical and physical
    procedures between the interrogator and tags to allocate a dedicated subcarrier
    channel to each of the tags to produce a continuous data streaming. \n— logical
    and physical procedure between the interrogator and the tags to start and stop
    the continuous data streaming. \n— logical interface between the interrogator
    and the tag to configure a digital sensor and to receive data from the digital
    sensor through the tag."
