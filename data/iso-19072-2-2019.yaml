    This document specifies the performance criteria and requirements of a three-way connection interface, including ground connection, linking the pyrotechnic device and harness connector built into a road vehicle.
    Performance criteria and requirements are defined for a sealed variant of the pyrotechnic device/initiator harness connector assembly (see Annex A).
    Performance criteria and requirements are defined for a two-way (without ground) variant of the pyrotechnic device/initiator harness connector assembly (see Annex B).
    Performance criteria and requirements are defined for a variant without a retainer of the pyrotechnic device/initiator harness connector assembly is defined (see Annex C).
