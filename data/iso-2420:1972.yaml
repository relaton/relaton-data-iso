  content: The principle consists in an accurate measurement of the thickness and
    diameter of a disk of leather and calculation of the apparent density by dividing
    the mass by the volume. Used apparatus consists of steel press knife, thickness
    gauge, balance (+/- 0,001 g) and instrument for measuring diameter. The method
    is applicable to all leathers for which an accurate measurement of thickness can
    be made.
