  content: 'A liquid or a vaporized gaseous test portion is injected into a gas chromatography
    column. After passage of the test portion through this column the oligomers are
    separated. The detection is performed by flame ionization. The peaks obtained
    are compared with those derived from an external standard. The oligomers which
    may be present are: 4-vinyl cyclohexene, 1,3-cyclooctadiene, 1,5-cyclooctadiene.
    The method is applicable to butadiene having oligomer contents greater than 10
    mg/kg.'
