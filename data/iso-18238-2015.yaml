    ISO 18238:2015 provides basic procedures and requirements of closed loop problem solving against product quality problems including failures, defects, accidents, and other undesirable conditions for organizations.
    ISO 18238:2015 is intended to improve the closed loop problem solving management which covers the impact mitigation of the problem, root causes identification and problem containment, and lessons learned.
    ISO 18238:2015 is applicable to problem solving management of all space products, starting from engineering development phase.
