    ISO 14186:2013 specifies the minimum design and performance criteria and testing methods of fire containment covers (FCCs) used:
    - either in those cargo compartments of civil transport aircraft where they constitute one means of complying with applicable airworthiness regulations,
    - or on a voluntary basis, when deemed appropriate by operators to improve fire protection in aircraft cargo compartments where airworthiness regulations do not mandate their use.
