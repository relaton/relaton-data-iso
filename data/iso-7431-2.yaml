    This document specifies requirements for three classes, marking, packaging, transportation and storage of thiourea for industrial purpose, and give safety information in Annex A.
    Class I is a high quality grade normally used in the areas of optical, electronic and new energy materials. Class II and class III belong to ordinary quality grades and are suitable for the basic chemical industry, such as printing, dyeing, pharmaceutical field, pesticides, and mineral processing, etc.
    This document is applicable to material which consists essentially of thiourea, (CH4N2S).
    Thiourea structure formula:                              
    Molecular weight: 76,12 (according to international relative atomic mass of 2019)
