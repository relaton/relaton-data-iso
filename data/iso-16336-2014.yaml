    ISO 16336:2014 gives guidelines for applying the optimization method of robust parameter design, also called as parameter design, an effective methodology for optimization based on Taguchi Methods, to achieve robust products.
    ISO 16336:2014 prescribes signal-to-noise ratio (hereafter SN ratio) as a measure of robustness, and the procedures of parameter design to design robust products utilizing this measure. The word "robust" in this International Standard means minimized variability of product's function under various noise conditions, that is, insensitivity of the product's function to the changes in the levels of noises. For robust products, their responses are sensitive to signal and insensitive to noises.
    The approach of ISO 16336:2014 can be applied to any products that are designed and manufactured, including machines, chemical products, electronics, foods, consumer goods, software, new materials, and services. Manufacturing technologies are also regarded as products that are used by manufacturing processes.
