abstract:
- content: ISO 24408:2005 specifies production tests and inspections, and marking
    requirements for position-indicating lights used in conjunction with various items
    of life-saving equipment, including survival craft interior lights. Specifically,
    it applies to position-indicating lights which have been type approved by or on
    behalf of a national maritime safety administration, to the requirements of the
    International Maritime Organization LSA Code, for use in ships subject to the
    requirements of the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, 1974
    (as amended). The basic principles may also be considered suitable for position-indicating
    lights manufactured to other than the IMO requirements.
