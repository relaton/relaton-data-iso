    This document provides a method for addressing ship generated waste and cargo residues from when they are offloaded from the ship, to how they are managed ashore. The provision, operation and use of port reception facilities (PRFs) are inherently linked, so this document addresses the design of PRFs, and their operation and management. This document is designed to be used by ports and terminals with existing PRFs which aim to refine their systems; it can also be used by new ports and terminals that are developing PRFs.
    Parties to MARPOL are obligated as Port States to ensure that port reception facilities (PRFs) adequate to meet the needs of the ships using them without causing undue delay are provided at their ports and terminals. MARPOL does not seek to regulate the management of ship generated waste and cargo residues at ports and terminals beyond the reception facility requirement. However, ports and terminals may need to consider national, regional and local regulations. While these regulations can exceed the scope of MARPOL, the IMO recognises the need to manage ship generated waste and cargo residues at ports and terminals as part of an environmentally sound management approach for avoiding, minimising, and eliminating pollution from ships.
    In consideration of above, this document applies to the management of ship generated waste and cargo residues regulated by MARPOL that are discharged at ports and terminals. It also covers principles and issues that should be considered in the development of a PWMP, its implementation and PRF operations. The operation of any PRF is governed by the principles and procedures included in the PWMP. The procedures to operate the PRF and the development of a PWMP are closely linked and therefore are integrated into this document.
    This document addresses the principles and issues that should be considered in:
    —          The development of a port waste management strategy;
    —          The design and operation of PRF;
    —          PWMP development, implementation and compliance; and
    —          PRF management and accountability.
    This document has been designed to be used by ports and terminals of any size. It does not give specifics on the size or location of a PRF in each port, but provides a list of principles to be considered and applied to any size of type of port or terminal (e.g. marina, fishing port, container terminal, oil terminal, roll on/roll off terminal, cruise terminal, ferry terminal, bulk or general cargo terminal, ship repair or recycling facility, and offshore terminal). Inland ports and marinas and those ports that have entered regional arrangements for the provision of a PRF can also use this document.
