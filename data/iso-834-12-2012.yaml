abstract:
- content: "ISO 834-12:2012 specifies the procedures to be followed for determining
    the fire resistance of non-load-bearing separating elements when exposed to heating
    on one face when the specimen size is such that a less than full scale fire resistance
    furnace is justified. This condition is particularly found in the testing of separating
    elements in transport applications since the end-use dimensions of the barrier
    products are often smaller than those specified in other parts of ISO 834. Specimen
    sizes requiring less than full size resistance furnaces are also found when testing
    elements to be fitted into a separating element, such as pipe penetration systems,
    ducts, dampers and cable transits.\nThe test is not appropriate for the evaluation
    of curtain walls (non-load-bearing external walls suspended from the ends of floor
    slabs) or walls containing doors or glazing. Tests of walls containing doors are
    covered by ISO 3008; tests of walls containing glazing are covered by ISO 3009.\nThe
    application of this test to other untested forms of construction is acceptable
    when the construction complies with the direct field of application as given in
    ISO 834-12:2012 or when it is subjected to a field of extended application analysis
    in accordance with ISO/TR 12470. "
