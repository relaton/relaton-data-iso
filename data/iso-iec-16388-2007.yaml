  content: "The technology of bar coding is based on the recognition of patterns encoded
    in bars and spaces of defined dimensions. There are numerous methods of encoding
    information in bar code form, known as symbologies. Code 39 is one such symbology.
    The rules defining the translation of characters into bar and space patterns and
    other essential features are known as the symbology specification. \nIn the past,
    symbology specifications were developed and published by a number of organizations,
    resulting in certain instances in conflicting requirements for certain symbologies.\nManufacturers
    of bar code equipment and users of bar code technology require publicly available
    standard symbology specifications to which they can refer when developing equipment
    and application standards.\nISO/IEC 16388:2007 specifies the requirements for
    the bar code symbology known as Code 39; it specifies Code 39 symbology characteristics,
    data character encodation, dimensions, tolerances, decoding algorithms and parameters
    to be defined by applications. It specifies the Symbology Identifier prefix strings
    for Code 39 symbols."
