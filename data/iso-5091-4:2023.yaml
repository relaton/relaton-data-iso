- content: |-
    This document specifies the standard requirements regarding design, construction and maintenance to be applied for structural intervention using the jacketing method, which places reinforcing materials such as reinforcing steel or fibre-reinforced polymer (FRP) grids around the periphery of existing concrete column or beam and jackets these members with cementitious materials.
    This document specifies structural intervention of existing concrete structures using cementitious materials design and execution principles, and strategies for defects and on-going deterioration including, but not limited to:
    a)       mechanical actions, e.g. fatigue, impact, overloading, movement caused by settlement, blast, vibration, and seismic actions;
    b)       chemical and biological actions from environments, e.g. sulfate attack, alkali-aggregate reaction;
    c)        physical actions, e.g. freeze–thaw, thermal cracking, moisture movement, salt crystallization, fire, and erosion;
    d)       reinforcement corrosion;
    e)       original construction defects that remained unaddressed from the time of construction.
