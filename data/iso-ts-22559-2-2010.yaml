    in the course of the operation and use of, or work on, lifts (elevators).\nISO/TS
    22559-2:2010 is applicable to lifts that can\na) be located in any permanent and
    fixed structure within or attached to a building, except lifts located in private
    residences (single family units) or means of transport, e.g. ships,\nb) have any
    rated load, size of load-carrying unit and speed, and travel distance and number
    of landings, \nc) be affected by fire in the load-carrying unit, earthquakes,
    weather or floods, and\nd) be foreseeably misused (e.g. overloaded), but not vandalized."
