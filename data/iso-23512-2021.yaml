    This document specifies the minimum essential variables in order to produce a component of the required consistency and quality for the following thermal joining processes:
    —     ultrasonic welding/staking/spot welding;
    —     infrared welding;
    —     hot gas convection welding;
    —     linear vibration welding;
    —     orbital vibration welding;
    —     spin welding;
    —     laser welding;
    —     hot plate welding;
    —     heat staking: hot air;
    —     heat staking: electrical; and
    —     heat staking: infrared (IR).
    This document defines the thermal joining process specification (TJPS) for each of the thermal joining processes listed above, to ensure that all the essential variables are properly considered, including the qualified range of each variable, in order to establish and maintain component quality at an acceptable level.
    NOTE     Standards on joining of plastic pipes, fittings, valves and/or auxiliary equipment, and the assessment of the properties of the resulting joints are developed and maintained by ISO/TC 138.
