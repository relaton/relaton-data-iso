    ISO/TS 14907-1:2010 specifies the test procedures of EFC road-side equipment (RSE) and on-board equipment (OBE) with regard to the conformance to standards and requirements for type approval and acceptance testing which is within the realm of EFC application specifically.
    ISO/TS 14907-1:2010 is restricted to systems operating within the radio emission, EMC regulations, traffic and other regulations of the countries in which they are operated and it is therefore a requirement that all required equipment approvals from an authenticated and accredited test house have been obtained in order to claim compliance.
    ISO/TS 14907-1:2010 identifies a set of suitable parameter and provides test procedures to enable the proof of a complete EFC-system as well as components of an EFC-system e.g. OBE related to the defined requirements of an application. The defined parameter and tests are assigned to the following groups of parameters:
    —   functionality;
    —   quality;
    —   referenced pre-tests.
    ISO/TS 14907-1:2010 describes procedures, methods and tools, and a test plan which shows the relation between all tests and the sequence of these tests. It lists all tests that are required to measure the performance of EFC equipment. It describes which EFC-equipment is covered by the test procedures; the values of the parameters to be tested are not included. It also describes how the tests are to be performed, and which tools and pre-requisites are necessary before this series of tests can be undertaken. It is assumed that the security of the system is inherent in the communications and EFC functionality tests, therefore they are not addressed here. All tests in ISO/TS 14907-1:2010 provide instructions to evaluate the test results.
    The test procedures can be used for prototype testing, type approvals, test of installations and periodic inspections. ISO/TS 14907-1:2010 defines only the test and test procedures, not the benchmark figures that these are to be measured against.
    EFC-systems for DSRC consist, in principle, of a group of technical components, which in combination fulfil the functions required for the collection of fees by electronic automatic means. These components comprise all, or most of, the following:
    —   on-board equipment (OBE) within a vehicle;
    —   on-board unit containing the communications and computing sub-functions;
    —   optional integrated circuit card which may carry electronic money, service rights and other secured information;
    —   communication between OBE and RSE based on DSRC;
    —   equipment for the fee collection at the road-side (RSE) containing the communications and computing sub-functions;
    —   equipment for the enforcement at the road-side;
    —   central equipment for the administration and operation of the system.
    ISO/TS 14907-1:2010 relates solely to OBE and RSE and the DSRC interface between OBE and RSE including its functions to perform the fee collection. All the equipment used for enforcement (e.g. detection, classification, localization and registration) and central equipment are outside the scope of ISO/TS 14907-1:2010.
