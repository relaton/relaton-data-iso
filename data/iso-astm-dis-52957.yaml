abstract:
- content: This document specifies ceramic part properties, design freedom, strengths
    and applications of additively manufactured parts made of ceramic materials. It
    aims at product planners and designers and provides the necessary basic knowledge
    about ceramic parts and the possibilities specific to additively manufactured
    ceramics, including strengths and limitations of the most commonly utilized ceramic
    additive manufacturing methods. In-depth previous knowledge in these areas is
    not assumed.
