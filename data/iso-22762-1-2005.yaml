    ISO 22762 applies to elastomeric seismic isolators used to provide buildings or bridges with protection from earthquake damage. The isolators covered consist of alternate elastomer layers and reinforcing steel plates. They are placed between a superstructure and its substructure to provide both flexibility for decoupling structural systems from ground motion, and damping capability to reduce displacement at the isolation interface and the transmission of energy from the ground into the structure at the isolation frequency.
    ISO 22762-1:2005 specifies the test methods for determination of the characteristics of elastomeric seismic isolators and for measurement of the properties of the rubber material used in their manufacture.
    The specifications cover testing for all properties required in the elastomeric isolators, such as compression and shear properties, the durability of the isolators and the physical properties of the materials used in isolators.
