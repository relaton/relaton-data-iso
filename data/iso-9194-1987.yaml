  content: Defines the actions due to the self-weight of structures, non-structural
    elements and stored materials and gives the numerical values of their densities.
    These actions are to be determined by multiplying the densities by the gravitational
    acceleration and by the actual volume. The actions caused by the weight of the
    earth placed on the structures are similarly calculated.
