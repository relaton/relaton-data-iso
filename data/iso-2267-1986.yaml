  content: A given number of test pieces of control cloth and machine loads of normally
    soiled articles are together subjected to a given number of consecutive laundering
    processes. After these processes characteristic properties of the test pieces
    of control cloth are measured and compared with their initial values. The changes
    in these properties during washing should enable the causes of damage in household
    textile articles in the laundering process to be detected.
