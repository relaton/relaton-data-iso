- content: |-
    This document specifies the refilling interface for the NOx reduction agent AUS 32 in conformance with ISO 22241-1, which is needed to operate converters with a selective catalytic reduction (SCR) exhaust treatment system.
    This document specifies the minimum functional and geometric requirements of an open refilling system, in order to ensure compatibility between the on-board refilling system and the off-board refilling system. Compatibility conditions for a sealed refilling system are provided in Annex A.
    This document applies to commercial vehicles and buses as defined in ISO 3833 and having a gross vehicle mass of more than 3,5 t, designed to use stationary off-board refilling systems. This document also applies to the nozzle of stationary off-board refilling systems.
    NOTE            Throughout this document, the term “NOx reduction agent AUS 32” is abbreviated to “AUS 32”.
