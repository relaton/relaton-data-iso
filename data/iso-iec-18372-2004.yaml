  content: The RapidIO architecture was developed to address the need for a high-performance
    low pin count packet-switched system level interconnect to be used in a variety
    of applications as an open standard. The architecture is targeted toward networking,
    telecom, and high performance embedded applications. It is intended primarily
    as an intra-system interface, allowing chip-to-chip and board-toboard communications
    at Gigabyte per second performance levels. It provides a rich variety of features
    including high data bandwidth, low-latency capability and support for high-performance
    I/O devices, as well as providing globally shared memory, message passing, and
    software managed programming models.
