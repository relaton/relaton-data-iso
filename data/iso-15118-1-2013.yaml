abstract:
- content: "ISO 15118 specifies the communication between Electric Vehicles (EV),
    including Battery Electric Vehicles and Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicles, and
    the Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE). As the communication parts of this
    generic equipment are the Electric Vehicle Communication Controller (EVCC) and
    the Supply Equipment Communication Controller (SECC), ISO 15118 describes the
    communication between these components. Although ISO 15118 is oriented to the
    charging of electric road vehicles, it is open for other vehicles as well. \nISO
    15118-1:2013 specifies terms and definitions, general requirements and use cases
    as the basis for the other parts of ISO 15118. It provides a general overview
    and a common understanding of aspects influencing the charge process, payment
    and load levelling.\nISO 15118 does not specify the vehicle internal communication
    between battery and charging equipment and the communication of the SECC to other
    actors and equipment (beside some dedicated message elements related to the charging).
    All connections beyond the SECC, and the method of message exchanging are considered
    to be out of the scope as specific use cases."
