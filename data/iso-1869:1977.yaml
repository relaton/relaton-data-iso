  content: Specifies the sampling, the determination of residue on evaporation, the
    determination of distillation characteristics, the determination of density at
    20 °C, the determination of acidity, the determination of water and the measurement
    of colour. The determination of distillation characteristics indicates either
    the temperatures corresponding to the collection of each of two volumes of distillate,
    V0 and V1, or the difference between these two volumes. These two volumes will
    be indicated in the specification for dichloromethan agreed between the interested
    parties. Replaces ISO Recommendation R 1869-1970.
