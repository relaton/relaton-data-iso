abstract:
- content: |-
    This document describes a basic role model of smart city intelligent transport systems (ITS) service applications as a common platform for smart city instantiation, directly communicating via secure ITS interfaces. It provides a paradigm describing:
    a) a framework for the provision of a cooperative ITS service application;
    b) a description of the concept of operations, regulatory aspects and options, and the role models;
    c) a conceptual architecture between actors involved in the provision/receipt of ITS service applications;
    d) references for the key documents on which the architecture is based;
    e) a taxonomy of the organization of generic procedures.
