abstract:
- content: Applies to fibre building boards as defined in ISO 818. The specified method
    is based on the principle that a specimen supported in two points is loaded in
    its centre until rupture. The bending strength is calculated from this load, the
    distance between the supports, and the width and thickness of the specimen.
