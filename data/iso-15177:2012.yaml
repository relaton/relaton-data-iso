    This International Standard specifies the characteristics of hot-rolled twin-roll cast carbon steel sheet of commercial quality produced by the twin-roll cast process. Hot-rolled twin-roll cast steel sheet is suitable for many applications where the presence of oxide or scale or normal surface imperfections disclosed after removal of oxide or scale, are not objectionable. It is not suitable for applications where the surface is of prime importance.
    NOTE A steel sheet that is subjected to subsequent re-rolling is not covered by this International Standard.
    Commercial quality twin-roll cast steel sheet is intended for general fabrication purposes where sheet is used in the flat condition or for bending, moderate forming and welding operations
