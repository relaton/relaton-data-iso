    ISO/IEC 30170:2012 specifies the syntax and semantics of the computer programming language Ruby, and the requirements for conforming Ruby processors, strictly conforming Ruby programs, and conforming Ruby programs.
    It does not specify
    - the limit of size or complexity of a program text which a conforming processor evaluates,
    - the minimal requirements of a data processing system that is capable of supporting a conforming processor,
    - the method for activating the execution of programs on a data processing system, and
    - the method for reporting syntactic and runtime errors.
