abstract:
- content: |-
    ISO/IEC TR 13066:2012 provides an overview to the structure and terminology of the IAccessible2 accessibility API.
    It provides:
    - a description of the overall architecture and terminology of the API;
    - further introductory explanations regarding the content and use of the API beyond those found in Annex A of ISO/IEC 13066-1;
    - an overview of the main properties, including:

    of user interface elements,
    of how to get and set focus,
    of communication mechanisms in the API;


    - a discussion of design considerations for the API (e.g. pointers to external sources of information on accessibility guidance related to using the API);
    - information on extending the API (and where this is appropriate);
    - an introduction to the programming interface of the API (including pointers to external sources of information).
    It provides this information as an introduction to the IAccessible2 API to assist:
    - IT system level developers who create custom controls and/or interface to them;
    - AT developers involved in programming "hardware to software" and "software to software" interactions.
