abstract:
- content: This document describes the main magnetospheric large-scale current systems
    and the magnetic field in the Earth's magnetosphere and provides the main requirements
    to the model of the magnetospheric magnetic field. Ionospheric currents are not
    considered in this document. The document also provides a working example of the
    model and establishes the parameters of magnetospheric large-scale current systems
    which are changing in accordance with conditions in the space environment. The
    document can be used to develop the new models of magnetospheric magnetic field.
    Such models are useful in investigating physical processes in the Earth's magnetosphere
    as well as in calculations, developing, testing and estimating the results of
    exploitation of spacecrafts and other equipment operating in the space environment.
