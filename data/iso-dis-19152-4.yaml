  content: "This part of ISO 19152 provides the concepts and detailed structure for
    standardization in the land administration domain. In order to achieve public
    policy objectives, some regulations use geographical spaces for mandating or enabling
    particular behaviours or outcomes. \n\nThis part of ISO 19152 defines a general
    schema for valuation information systems in the context of the land administration.\n\nIt
    is designed to represent all stages of administrative property valuation, namely
    representation of parties involved in valuations, identification of properties,
    assessment of properties through single or mass appraisal procedures, recording
    transaction prices, generation and representation of sales statistics, and dealing
    with appeals. The proposed model in this standard may provide public bodies a
    common basis for the development of local and/or national information models and
    databases, enabling the integration of valuation databases with land administration
    databases, and can act as a guide for the private sector\n\nThe first edition
    of LADM standard, ISO 19152:2012 concentrated on Land Administration and value
    component of land administration was considered in out of scope. This information
    is now included in Part 4 with a more general perspective. This part of the standard
    provides an abstract, conceptual model related to\n•\tvalue (valuation, mass valuation);\n•\ttransaction
    prices;\n•\tsales statistics;\n•\tvaluation units (parcel, building, condominium
    unit, valuation unit group)"
