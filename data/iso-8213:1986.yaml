abstract:
- content: From the lot to be sampled a certain number of increments is taken. The
    increments are mixed to form either a bulk sample or several primary samples,
    depending on the purposes of the sampling. By means of replicate reductions a
    reduced sample is prepared from the bulk sample or from each primary sample, then
    several laboratory samples, each stage of the division being preceded in each
    case by blending and, if necessary, by grinding and sieving the product. This
    International Standard is applicable to products with a maximum particle size
    of 100 mm.
