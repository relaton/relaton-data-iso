abstract:
- content: "ISO 15156-3:2003 gives requirements and recommendations for the selection
    and qualification of CRAs (corrosion-resistant alloys) and other alloys for service
    in equipment, used in oil and natural gas production and natural gas treatment
    plants in H2S-containing environments, whose failure could pose a risk to the
    health and safety of the public and personnel or to the environment. It can be
    applied to help to avoid costly corrosion damage to the equipment itself. It supplements,
    but does not replace, the materials' requirements of the appropriate design codes,
    standards or regulations.\nISO 15156-3:2003 addresses the resistance of these
    materials to damage that may be caused by sulfide stress-cracking, stress-corrosion
    cracking and galvanically-induced hydrogen stress-cracking. \nISO 15156-3:2003
    is only concerned with cracking. Loss of material by general (mass loss) or localized
    corrosion is not addressed.\nTable 1 provides a non-exhaustive list of equipment
    to which ISO 15156-3:2003 is applicable, including permitted exclusions.\nISO
    15156-3:2003 applies to the qualification and selection of materials for equipment
    designed and constructed using conventional elastic design criteria. For designs
    utilizing plastic criteria (e.g. strain-based and limit-state designs) see ISO
    15156-1:2001, Clause 5. \nISO 15156-3:2003 is not necessarily suitable for application
    to equipment used in refining or downstream processes and equipment."
