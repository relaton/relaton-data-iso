    will form the basis for standards development work of business analysts,\nbusiness
    users and information technology specialists supplying the content of and\nimplementing
    applications that will employ the UN/CEFACT Core Component Library\n(CCL). The
    Core Component Library will be stored in a UN/CEFACT repository and\nidentified
    in an ebXML compliant registry.\nDue to the evolving nature of the UN/CEFACT Core
    Component Library, ISO/TS 15000-5:2005\nincludes material that focuses on the
    business community doing further discovery and\nanalysis work. Some of the contents
    of ISO/TS 15000-5:2005 are not typical of this type of\ntechnical document. However,
    they are critical for successful adoption and standardization in\nthis area to
    move forward."
