abstract:
- content: "This document specifies a test method for the determination of the air-purification
    performance, with regards to the removal of formaldehyde, of materials that contain
    a photocatalyst or have photocatalytic films on the surface, usually made from
    semiconducting metal oxides such as titanium dioxide or other ceramic materials,
    by continuous exposure of a test piece to the model air pollutant under illumination
    from indoor light. \nThis document is intended for use with different kinds of
    materials, such as construction materials in flat sheet, board or plate shape,
    which are the basic forms of materials for various applications. This document
    also applies to materials in honeycomb form, and to plastic or paper materials
    containing ceramic microcrystals and composites. This document does not apply
    to powder or granular photocatalytic materials.\nThis test method is usually applicable
    to photocatalytic materials produced for air purification. This method is not
    suitable for the determination of other performance attributes of photocatalytic
    materials, i.e. decomposition of water contaminants, self-cleaning, antifogging
    and antibacterial actions. "
