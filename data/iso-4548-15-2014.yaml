    ISO 4548-15:2014 specifies a method of testing the structural integrity of full-flow lubricating oil filters to withstand engine vibrations. This test is intended for application to spin-on type filters and detachable filters with disposable elements with a maximum flow rate of 100 L/min. Upon agreement between manufacturer and purchaser, this test method can be applied to filters with higher flow rates.
    This test method is intended for test parts made from composite materials that experience mechanical property changes within the temperature range experienced in service. The test can be applied to filters with other temperature sensitive materials if thought applicable by agreement between the filter manufacturer and the purchaser.
