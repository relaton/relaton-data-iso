    This document provides a method for assessing the very early oxidative degradation state of polymers during outdoor weathering and indoor accelerated weathering tests and the influence of various additives can also be evaluated.
    This method is based on an analytical method in which the degree of progress of the oxidative degradation reaction of a polymer is sensitively detected by measurement of chemically induced ultra-weak photon emission (UPE).
