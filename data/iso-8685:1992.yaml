  content: Sets out requirements for the sampling from moving streams and stationary
    situations, including stopped-belt sampling, to provide gross samples for sample
    preparation. The procedures recommended may not be applicable in cases of extreme
    segregation, e.g. very wet ore due to its sticky nature, or very dry ore due to
    generation of dust.
