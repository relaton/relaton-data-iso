    This document specifies the construction, operational requirements and test methods for water-driven chemical injector pumps (hereinafter, water-driven injector pumps). These water-driven injector pumps are used to inject chemicals into irrigation systems. The chemicals include liquid fertilizers and solutions of fertilizers and other soluble agricultural chemicals such as acids and pesticides.
    This document is applicable to water-driven injector pumps intended to operate at water temperatures of up to 50 °C and with the types and concentrations of chemicals routinely applied in irrigation.
    It does not cover the function of backflow prevention devices, nor is it applicable to water-driven devices for injecting chemicals into an irrigation system operating on the basis of the Venturi principle.
