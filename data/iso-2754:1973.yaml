  content: Applicable to the determination in the presence of ammoniacal salts less
    than 15 mg in the aliquot amount taken for the determination. In the presence
    of quantities exceeding 15 mg the ammoniacal nitrogen shall be removed by a cation
    exchange resin because these salts interfere with the determination. The principle
    of the reaction consists in formation of a violet-red complex between allophanic
    acid amide (H2 N.CO.NH.CO.NH2 ) and copper sulphate in the presence of an alkaline
    solution of potassium sodium tartrate. Photometric measurement at a wavelength
    of about 550 nm. Has also been approved by the IUPAC.
