abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: Describes the classes 0 to 3 of the OSI transport protocol, defined in
    ISO 8073 using the formal description technique LOTOS, which is defined in ISO
    8807. Transport protocol class 4 and NMCS are not covered. In view of complexity
    and widespread use of OSI standards it is imperative to have precise and unambiguous
    definitions of these standards. Formal Description Techniques form an effective
    approach to providing such definitions. Annexes A and B give definitions relating
    to the Transport and Network Services, Annex C gives an interpretation of ISO
    8073, Annexes E and F include indices of process and type definitions.
