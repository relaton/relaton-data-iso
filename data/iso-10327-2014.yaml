    ISO 10327:2014 covers the minimum design and operational testing requirements for general purpose, base-restrained containers exclusively intended for the main or upper deck cargo compartments of main line civil transport aircraft, capable of being used by either airlines or shippers and requiring an airworthiness authority approval (certification).
    ISO 10327:2014 does not cover the performance requirements and ultimate load testing parameters for airworthiness authorities approval (certification), which are covered in ISO 21100 or, for units approved prior to 2012, ISO 8097:2001. The design and operational testing requirements of ISO 10327:2014 are additional to the performance and certification testing requirements of these International Standards.
    ISO 10327:2014 does not cover containers with an overall height of 1 625 mm (64 in) or less, that can be loaded on the lower deck compartments of main line civil transport aircraft, which are specified in ISO 6517, nor air-surface main deck containers, which are specified in ISO 4128 and ISO 8323.
