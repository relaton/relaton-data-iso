    This document specifies:
    —     requirements on the physical layer at system level,
    —     requirements on the interoperability test set-ups,
    —     interoperability test plan that checks the requirements for the physical layer at system level,
    —     requirements on the device-level physical layer conformance test set-ups, and
    —     device-level physical layer conformance test plan that checks a set of requirements for the OSI physical layer that are relevant for device vendors.
    The interoperability test plan checks the physical layer system requirements specified in this document and in ISO/IEC/IEEE 8802-3:2017/Amd 9.
    This test plan is structured in four different test groups, attending to the kind of system requirements that covers:
    —     link status, that includes the tests that check the status of the link by using the content of the available registers and its accuracy with the real status of the link,
    —     link-up, that includes the tests that check the time that the IUT reaches a reliable link status from certain state,
    —     channel quality, that includes the tests that check the quality of the optical channel by using the content of the available registers and its accuracy with the real quality of the optical channel, and
    —     wake-up and sleep, that include tests that check that the transmission and reception of the wake-up and sleep events.
    The device-level conformance test plan checks the device-level requirements specified in the ISO 21111 series and in ISO/IEC/IEEE 8802-3:2017/Amd 9.
    This test plan is structured in four different test groups, attending to the test set-up required:
    —     high-attenuation channel,
    —     low-attenuation channel,
    —     optical IUT transmitter measurements, and
    —     wake-up and synchronised link sleep.
