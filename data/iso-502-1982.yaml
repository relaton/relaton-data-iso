  content: The sample is heated under standard conditions to a final temperature of
    600 C. The coke residue obtained is classified by reference to a series of standard
    residues. If the coke residue produced is so swollen that it fills the crosssection
    of the retort tube, the determination is repeated with the coal admixed with a
    suitable quantity of electrode carbon or equivalent material.
