    This document specifies the requirements for steel sheet, zinc-coated and zinc-iron alloy-coated by the continuous hot-dip process, of structural quality.
    The product is intended for applications where resistance to corrosion is of prime importance.
    The steel sheet is produced in a number of grades, coating masses, ordering conditions, and surface treatments.
    This document does not cover steel sheet designated as commercial quality, or drawing quality, which are covered in ISO 3575.
