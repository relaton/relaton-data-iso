    This document defines a set of metadata to support the audit trail of the transformation of a geometry definition, while it is distributed and shared in supply-chains, to ensure the traceability of geometric model data. It also defines a set of web services based on the utilisation of these metadata.
    The following are within the scope of this document:
    —     metadata definitions for geometry transformation audit trail:
    —     syntax for storing these metadata in geometry data sets in various formats;
    —     conformance level for implementers and business processes;
    —     definitions of web services to query the geometric model data set and its associated metadata.
    The following are outside the scope of this document:
    —     service specifications for CAD operations;
    —     specifications of a cybersecurity infrastructure to enable web services;
    —     the technical implementation of a STEP geometry services client or server;
    —     any geometric model definition;
    —     any product and manufacturing information (PMI) definition;
    —     archiving.
