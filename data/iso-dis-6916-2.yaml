    This part of ISO 6916 classifies flexible cellular rubber products known as sponge and expanded rubber. The base
    material used in their manufacture may be natural rubber, reclaimed rubber, synthetic rubber or rubber-like
    material, either alone or in combination. Thermoplastic rubbers are not included. This part of ISO 6916 does not
    apply to latex foam rubbers or shoe soling.
    Sheeting materials are covered by ISO 6916-1. This part (part 2) covers vulcanized cellular rubber products that
    are manufactured by a moulding or continuous vulcanization process, i.e. hot air, microwave, infra-red, liquid curing
    medium (LCM), shearing-head vulcanization or a combination of two or more of these methods.
    In the case of conflict between the provisions of this part of ISO 6916 and those of the detailed specification or test
    method for a particular product, the latter shall take precedence. Reference to the methods shall specifically state
    the desired test or tests.
