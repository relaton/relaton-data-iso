    This document specifies the methodology of using multielectrode arrays for the measurement of the corrosion, especially localized corrosion, of metals and alloys. It can be used as a powerful tool for studying the initiation and propagation processes of localized corrosion. It is also a useful tool for long-term corrosion monitoring in the field, especially for localized corrosion, and for obtaining high throughput results for the evaluation of metals with different compositions and/or physical properties in different environments and the screening of a large number of inhibitors. Additionally, the galvanic coupling current and potential distribution of dissimilar metal parings can be assessed by multielectrode arrays. Multielectrode arrays can be implemented in full-immersion, thin-film, spray and alternating wet?dry cycle exposures.
    This document is not intended to be used for measurements of corrosion caused by a non-electrochemical mechanism.
