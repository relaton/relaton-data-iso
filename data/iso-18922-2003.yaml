    ISO 18922:2002 is applicable to evaluating the scratch resistance of dry, processed photographic film. It specifies two test methods for evaluating the scratch resistance on either the emulsion or the base side. The two test methods usually give comparable results. It provides empirical laboratory tests made under controlled conditions, but does not necessarily predict the actual scratch resistance of a film in any particular commercial machine.
    Method A gives a measure of the minimum load requirement to produce a scratch, requires less elaborate evaluation equipment and is less stringent in its requirements of the optical condition of the specimens. Method B provides a measurement of haze produced by various stylus loads, is a more complete measure of scratch characteristics of a material and is the preferred method.
