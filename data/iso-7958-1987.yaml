abstract:
- content: Specifies the nomenclature appropriate to each part of the machine (in
    English, French and Russian, and the equvalent terms in German, Spanish, Italian
    and Swedish) and the geometrical and practical tests for these sawing machines,
    and gives the corresponding permissible deviations which apply to machines of
    general purpose use and normal accuracy. It deals only with the verification of
    the accuracy of the machine. It does not apply to the testing of the running of
    the machine nor to its characteristics which should be checked before the accuracy
    is tested.
