    ISO 19018:2004 contains terms, abbreviations and graphical symbols, which are to be used in maritime navigation on board ships. The application of abbreviations is useful, but they should not be used in mathematical formulae. Symbols for use in mathematical formulae are mentioned, if necessary.
    Navigation is the process of position finding as well as planning, recording and controlling the movement of a craft or vehicle from one place to another.
