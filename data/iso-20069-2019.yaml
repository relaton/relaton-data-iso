abstract:
- content: "This document provides guidance for assessment and evaluation of planned
    changes to drug delivery systems that are integral with, packaged with, or cross-labelled
    for use with a specified medicinal product. This document is applicable to the
    drug delivery system's lifecycle from registration clinical studies to end-of-life.
    This document is applicable to the assessment of changes within the following
    drug delivery systems: \n—     needle-based injection systems for medical use;\n—
    \    aerosol drug delivery devices;\n—     needle-free injectors for medical use.\nNOTE
    \      These are covered by the ISO 11608 series, ISO 20072 and ISO 21649, respectively.\nThis
    document might also be useful for assessing and evaluate changes to other drug
    delivery devices or systems.\nExamples of changes that are within the scope of
    this document include but are not limited to the following:\na)    the same route
    of administration (e.g. change resulting in including a marketed prefilled syringe
    to an autoinjector);\nb)    changes to the drug delivery system design (e.g. change
    in configuration or layout of electrical and mechanical components);\nc)    changes
    to the medicinal product that affect the drug delivery system; including the primary
    container closure (e.g. viscosity, particle size);\nd)    changes in production
    or handling of the drug delivery system (e.g. process scale, manual to automated
    assembly, glue bond to sonic weld, mould cavitation, sterilization, storage, transportation,
    work instructions or methods);\ne)    changes in component materials or source
    of supply;\nf)     changes in software, including changes related to cybersecurity,
    encryption and connectivity;\ng)    changes in the user interface, including packaging;\nh)
    \   changes to labelling and/or instructions for use.\nRevisions or additions
    of software are within the scope of this document. The software can either be
    integrated into the physical drug delivery system, separate, or both.\nThe applicability
    of this document to non-integrated software is relevant to the extent that those
    software changes can impact the drug delivery system and/or impact how users interact
    with it.\nDepending on the nature of the change, there can be additional assessments
    and resulting activities, which can be outside the scope of this document.\nThis
    document does not provide guidance for defining the objective of the change, nor
    the various potential opportunities/options for fulfilling this objective."
