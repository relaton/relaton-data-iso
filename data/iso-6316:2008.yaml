abstract:
- content: "ISO 6316:2008 specifies requirements for hot-rolled steel strip of structural
    quality in the grades and classes listed in a table, usually without the use of
    microalloying elements. This product is intended for structural purposes where
    particular mechanical properties are required. It is generally used in the delivered
    condition and is intended for bolted, riveted or welded structures. It is commonly
    rolled on a narrow strip mill. \nISO 6316:2008 does not cover steels designated
    as commercial quality or drawing quality (covered in ISO 6317, Hot-rolled carbon
    steel strip of commercial and drawing qualities) or steels intended for boilers
    or pressure vessels, or steels to be rerolled to cold-reduced products, or steels
    designated as weathering steels, having increased atmospheric corrosion resistance."
