    This document defines the requirements and verification methods from design to on-orbit operation for Satellite Based Passive Microwave Sensors.
    This document covers the requirements for, design, analysis, manufacturing, ground tests and on-orbit self-sensor calibration and validation. In addition, this document includes the conditions considered for on-orbit inter-comparison among sensors as preparation for cross-calibration. This document includes some examples on how to apply the development of passive microwave sensors as shown in Annex A through D.
