  content: ISO 15765-4:2005 specifies requirements for the emissions-related systems
    of legislated OBD-compliant controller area networks (CAN), such communications
    networks consisting of a road vehicle equipped with a single or multiple emissions-related
    ECUs and external test equipment. It is based on the specifications of ISO 15765-2,
    ISO 11898-1 and ISO 11898-2, while placing restrictions on those standards for
    legislated-OBD purposes. It does not specify in-vehicle CAN bus architecture.
    Legislated OBD-compliant vehicles are to comply with external test equipment requirements.
