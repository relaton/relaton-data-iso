  content: This document is applicable to new projects and programs and to redesigned
    and upgraded launch pad and integration sites. This document describes the testing
    phases, goals, and general aspects for launch space complexes and complexes for
    assembly and tests of a vehicle and spacecraft and the associated equipment that,
    after successful testing, will be ready for launch vehicle processing and launch.
    This document can be applied to the creation of international launch pad and integration
    sites. At creation of new launching space complexes and complexes for assembly
    and tests of a vehicle and spacecraft (or at their modernization) within the framework
    of one country, the rules established by that country can be applied.
