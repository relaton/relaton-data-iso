  content: |-
    ISO/IEC 33020:2015 defines a process measurement framework that supports the assessment of process capability, in accordance with the requirements of ISO/IEC 33003. The process measurement framework provides a schema that can be used to construct a process assessment model conformant with ISO/IEC 33004 which can be used in the performance of assessment of process capability according to the requirements of ISO/IEC 33002. In the context of this and related standards, process capability is a process quality characteristic related to the ability of a process to consistently meet current or projected business goals.
    The process measurement frameworks defined in ISO/IEC 33020:2015 form a structure which
    a)    facilitates self-assessment,
    b)    provides a basis for use in process improvement and process quality determination,
    c)    is applicable across all application domains and sizes of organization,
    d)    produces a set of process (capability) attribute ratings (process profile), and
    e)    derives a process capability level.
