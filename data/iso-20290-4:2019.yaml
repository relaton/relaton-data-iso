    This document gives the test method for determination of ten percent fines value (TFV) of aggregates. This method gives a relative measure of the resistance of the aggregate crushing under the gradually applied compressive load.
    It covers two sets of procedures:
    —     the first procedure is applicable for aggregates tested in dry condition; and
    —     the second procedure is applicable for aggregates tested in a soaked condition.
    NOTE 1    Generally, the test can be done under dry conditions. However, the engineer in charge can choose to test them in soaked condition, if necessary.
    The method is applicable to aggregates of different strengths covering both weak and strong aggregates. It is applicable to standards aggregates, i.e. passing a 14,0 mm test sieve and retained on 10,0 mm test sieve.
    National standards can also exist for the aggregate size fraction to be taken for this test. In case this definite size fraction is not available, the test can be made on other sizes, given in Annex A. The comparison of results of non-standard sizes with standard size aggregates is not possible due to lack of available data.
    NOTE 2    Minor variations in grading divisions can be allowed in respective national standards.
