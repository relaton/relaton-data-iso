    ISO 21307:2017 establishes general principles regarding the procedure used in the construction and quality assessment of butt fusion jointing of polyethylene (PE) piping system components specified in accordance with relevant ISO standards. These components are installed in accordance with the relevant codes of practice, national regulations or industry guidance. Specifically, this document specifies three butt fusion jointing procedures for PE pipes and fittings. These are:
    -      single low-pressure fusion jointing procedure;
    -      dual low-pressure fusion jointing procedure;
    -      single high-pressure fusion jointing procedure.
    ISO 21307:2017 takes into consideration the materials and components used, the fusion jointing procedure and equipment and the quality assessment of the completed joint. It can be applied in conjunction with appropriate national regulations and standards.
