    1.1    ISO 12222:2017 specifies the position and dimensions of machine-readable identification numbers on 16 mm, 35 mm and 65 mm motion-picture film. These numbers are intended to be a machine-readable version of the latent image key number. ISO 12222:2017 also specifies the encoding format to be used for these machine-readable numbers, as well as the area scanned and the spectral characteristics of the scanner.
    1.2    ISO 12222:2017 also specifies the position, dimensions and content of human-readable identification (key) numbers for use on 16 mm, 35 mm and 65 mm motion-picture films intended for original photography or intermediate printing which also include the machine-readable key number described in 1.1.
    NOTE       These numbers normally are exposed onto the film at the time of manufacture.
    1.3    ISO 12222:2017 further specifies an area that may be used for optional manufacturer-specific film-type identification information.
    1.4    ISO 12222:2017 also specifies an area on the film which is not to be exposed by the film manufacturer, thus leaving it available for customer data recording.
    1.5    Finally, ISO 12222:2017 specifies an optional frame line index mark for 35 mm and 65 mm film.
