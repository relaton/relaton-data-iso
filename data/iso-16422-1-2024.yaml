    This document specifies the general characteristics of solid-wall pipes made of oriented unplasticized poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC-O) for piping systems intended to be used underground or above-ground (where protected from direct sunlight), for water supply, buried drainage, sewerage, treated waste water and irrigation under pressure.
    In conjunction with ISO 16422-2, ISO/TS 16422-3, ISO 16422-5 and ISO 1452-4, this document is applicable to PVC-O pipes and PVC-O fittings, as well as to valves, their joints and to joints with components of other plastics and non-plastics materials intended to be used for the following:
    a)       water mains and services lines;
    b)       conveyance of water for both outside and inside buildings;
    c)        drainage, sewerage and treated wastewater under pressure;
    d)       irrigation under pressure.
    This document is applicable to piping systems intended for the supply of water under pressure up to and including 25 °C (cold water), intended for human consumption and for general purposes as well as for wastewater under pressure.
    This document is also applicable to components for the conveyance of water and wastewater up to and including 45 °C. For temperatures between 25 °C and 45 °C, see ISO 16422-2:2023, Figure C.1.
    The piping system according to this document is intended for the conveyance of cold water up to pressures of 25 bar[1] and especially in those applications where special performance requirements are needed, such as impact loads and pressure fluctuations, up to pressure of 25 bar.
