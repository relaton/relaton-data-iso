abstract:
- content: The method is applicable to solid, but not powder fertilizers, dry only.
    It is not suitable for fertilizers which contain a large proportion of particles
    exceeding 5 mm in diameter. Its principle is pouring the fertilizer from a specified
    funnel into a specified measuring cylinder of known volume and weighing the contents
    of the cylinder. If the fertilizer has absorbed moisture during transport or storage,
    it is necessary to dry it in an environmental chamber.
