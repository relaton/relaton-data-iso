abstract:
- content: Reviews the progress of bioanalytical methodology, including the application
    of mathematical models which are available and may be used in the toxicological
    assessment of fire effluent atmospheres. Attention is also given to the application
    of such models as a means to minimize the use of laboratory animals in the testing
    of materials for fire effluent toxicity.
