    ISO/IEC 7811-1:2014 is one of a series of International Standards describing the parameters for identification cards as defined in the definitions clause and the use of such cards for international interchange.
    It specifies requirements for embossed characters on identification cards. The embossed characters are intended for transfer of data either by use of imprinters or by visual or machine reading. It takes into consideration both human and machine aspects and states minimum requirements.
    It is the purpose of ISO/IEC 7811-1:2014 to provide criteria to which cards shall perform. No consideration is given to the amount of use, if any, experienced by the card prior to test. Failure to conform to specified criteria should be negotiated between the involved parties.
    ISO/IEC 10373 1 specifies the test procedures used to check cards against the parameters specified in ISO/IEC 7811-1:2014.
