    The ISO 15638 series of standards (Parts 1 to 21) define the framework for online fleet management of regulated commercial freight vehicles utilizing data communication between in-vehicle systems and an application service provider via on-board communication unit interfacing with road monitoring infrastructure and roadside sensors. In this document, an unregulated service architecture frame work for freight vehicle stability monitoring architecture is defined. This statement does not preclude the regulated service where jurisdiction needs such a function.
    The objective of this document is to provide a freight vehicle stability monitoring service function/application for non-enforcement applications [and sometimes for regulated application service (RAS)]. This is for road transport safety management purposes of regulated commercial freight vehicle movements. The scope of this document is to
    a)    Reinforce vehicle stability monitoring for non-enforcement and other purposes by providing safety advisory information provisions to the freight vehicle drivers/operators transporting heavy goods on the freight vehicles.
    This document defines the framework for remote vehicle stability monitoring for non-enforcement and other management purpose applications conceptual operation.
    This document is complementary to, and does not replace, any ISO 15638 series standards. This document is beneficial to vehicle monitoring management purpose entities and it provides additional use cases for TARV service applications.
    This document is specialized towards the realization of safer road transport of freight vehicles by providing safety advisory information to the vehicle from the service provider and it utilizes ISO 15638 series of standards basic architecture framework defined in ISO 15638-21. The vehicle on-board sensor detected freight vehicle and/or freight container stability data and/or road side sensor data (vehicle stability status detection at roadside) are sent out to the service provider through ITS communication media. The service provider provides users with safety information such as recommended safe speed limit for that particular vehicle and gives speed limit advice messages as necessary. The various V2I communication paths can be used according to the various use cases.
