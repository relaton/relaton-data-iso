    This document applies to the design, testing, and operation of pre-engineered fire extinguishing systems that protect galley hoods, ducts, fryers and other grease-laden cooking equipment.
    This document provides requirements for the construction and performance of components within pre-engineered fire-extinguishing system units. This document also provides minimum requirements for the testing and evaluation of components.
    A product that contains features, characteristics, components, materials or systems that are new or different from those covered by the requirements in this document and that involve a risk of fire, electric shock, or injury to persons, can be evaluated using the appropriate additional component and end product testing.
