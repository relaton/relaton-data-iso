abstract:
- content: ISO 23041:2007 establishes standards, current guidelines and uniform procedures
    to minimize duplication of effort between the customer, the agency, participating
    nations and the emerging commercial space community. ISO 23041:2007 provides recommended
    practices for the development of space operations and support documentation, which
    should facilitate the sharing and exchange of beneficial information between organizations
    involved with space operations. ISO 23041:2007 establishes a common interface
    to simplify space operations planning and reduce the effort needed to learn and
    work with new space programmes and support organizations.
