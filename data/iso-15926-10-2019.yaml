abstract:
- content: |-
    This document defines the principles and methods for conformance testing of software implementations of ISO 15926.
    It provides guidance for developing test cases and testing procedures that cover the requirements specified in the ISO 15926 series and in different industry usage contexts, e.g. data exchange, use of reference data libraries and interface services.
    This document provides guidance in addition to the conformance in the parts.
    NOTE 1  Guidance on conformance ISO 15926 testing of complex scenarios which represent integrated interoperability is outside the scope of this document.
    NOTE 2  Guidance on the development of software that supports the way of file exchange in the simple scenario which represents unified interoperability is outside the scope of this document.
