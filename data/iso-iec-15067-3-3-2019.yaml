  script: Latn
  content: ISO/IEC 15067-3-3:2019(E) specifies a high-level architecture and a set
    of models for a demand-response energy management system with multiple interacting
    EMAs in a home or community housing (such as one or more apartment buildings or
    a campus of houses). These models specify the structure among multiple EMAs, which
    can be arranged in a mesh or hierarchical structure. This document builds upon
    ISO/IEC 15067-3.
