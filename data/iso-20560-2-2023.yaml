    This document specifies a safety information system for tanks made by combining several elements onto a single marking to communicate health and hazard safety information and information in case of an emergency for the purpose of accident prevention.
    The organization's risk assessment will determine when and where this safety information system for tanks will be used. Possible applications include, but are not limited to:
    —     markings installed on or near fixed above-ground tanks;
    —     markings installed on portable tanks;
    —     markings installed on or near tanks used in production facilities, marine structures and ships;
    —     markings posted on or near interchangeable containers with fixed connection;
    —     markings installed on or near overground elements of underground tanks.
    This document establishes additional principles to ISO 3864-1 for the purpose of establishing design principles for the display of safety information on tanks typically found in workplaces, industry and other facilities with tanks and containers. It covers safety information for tanks only. It is not intended for use on products.
    This document does not cover tanks that are moved or transported. It does not apply to the labelling according to the United Nations' Globally harmonized system of classification and labelling of chemicals (GHS).
    Safety signing of the hazards in an area is not part of this document.
