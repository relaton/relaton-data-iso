- content: "Scope of the proposed deliverable\n\nThis part of ISO 19152 provides the
    concepts and detailed structure for standardization in the land administration
    domain. In order to achieve public policy objectives, some regulations use geographical
    spaces for mandating or enabling particular behaviours or outcomes. International
    law, constitutional law, public law and private law define different geographical
    spaces that juxtapose or overlap each other to produce a complex legal reality.
    Harmonizing and integrating the activities related to management of these legal
    spaces is the overarching idea of the land administration paradigm. Even if they
    differ in their objectives and normative sources, objects created by geo-regulation
    share basic components. This part of ISO 19152 defines a general schema that permits
    regulatory information to be described in information systems. Essentially, legal
    actors – individuals, organizations, States – (party) create among themselves
    sets of obligations (rights, restrictions, responsibilities) with the specificity
    of having a geographical component (spatial unit). The way the legal spaces related
    to reality is defined by the survey system (survey and representation). All these
    elements are recognized through legal instruments and official documents (source).\n\nThe
    first edition of this standard, ISO 19152:2012 concentrated on Land Administration,
    Land Registration and Cadastre. This information is about the relationship between
    people and land. This is now included in Part 2 with a more refined survey model.
    This part of the standard provides an abstract, conceptual model with three packages
    and one sub-package related to\n•\tparties (people and organizations);\n•\tbasic
    administrative units, rights, responsibilities, and restrictions (ownership rights)
    -2];\n•\tspatial units (parcels, and the legal space of buildings and utility
    networks and other geometry) with a sub-package on surveying and spatial representation
    (geometry and topology)."
