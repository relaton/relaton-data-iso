  content: "This standard specifies lighting requirements for humans in indoor work
    places, which meet the needs for visual comfort, performance and safety of people
    having normal, or corrected to normal ophthalmic (visual) capacity and response
    to light. \n\nThis standard specifies requirements for lighting solutions for
    most indoor work places and their associated areas in terms of quantity and quality
    of illumination. The illumination can be provided by daylight, electric light
    or a combination of both.\n\nRecommendations are given for good lighting to fulfil
    the needs of integrative lighting.\n\nThis standard neither provides specific
    solutions nor recommendations for atmosphere or aesthetics created by lighting.
    It does not restrict the designers' freedom from exploring new techniques nor
    restrict the use of innovative equipment."
