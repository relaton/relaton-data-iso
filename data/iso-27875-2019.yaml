- content: |-
    This document provides a framework with which to assess, reduce, and control the potential risks that spacecraft and launch vehicle orbital stages (referred to hereinafter as "space vehicles") pose to people and the environment when those space vehicles re-enter the Earth's atmosphere and impact the Earth's surface. It is intended to be applied to the planning, design, and review of space vehicle missions for which controlled or uncontrolled re-entry is inevitable.
    This document is applicable to following objects in assessing their risk to the ground:
    a)    objects re-entering from orbit in conformance with ISO 24113;
    b)    launch vehicles (including payloads, other objects separated during the ascent phase, etc.) that are mentioned in flight safety activities under ISO 14620‑2[1]; and
    c)    interplanetary spacecraft returning to Earth.
    This document complements ISO 14620‑1 and ISO 17666.
    This document is not applicable to spacecraft containing nuclear power sources[2].
    NOTE 1    This document does not apply to Space Transportation Systems with wings and control functions intended for targeted landing.
    NOTE 2    Useful background information for this document is available in ISO 24113.
