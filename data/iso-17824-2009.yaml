    ISO 17824:2009 provides the requirements and guidelines for sand control screens for use in the petroleum and natural gas industries. Included are the requirements for design, design validation, functional evaluation, manufacturing, storage and transport. The requirements of ISO 17824:2009 are applicable to wire-wrap screens, pre-pack screens and metal-mesh screens as defined herein.
    The following items are outside the scope of ISO 17824:2009: expandable sand screens, slotted liners or tubing and accessory items such as centralizers or bull plugs; shunt screen technology, inflow control devices, downhole sensors and selective isolation devices, even though they can be an integral part of the sand control screen; screen filtration performance criteria, including test methods or analysis for sand retention efficiency; and end connections of the basepipe.
