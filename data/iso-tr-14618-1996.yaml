  content: Establishes a global model monthly mean of temperature, pressure, density
    and wind. These data can be used as a function of geopotential/geometric height.
    The zone has a latitudinal coverage from 80° S to 80° N, extending from altitudes
    between 30 km and 120 km. Serves as basis for the design and operation of aircraft
    and space vehicles.
