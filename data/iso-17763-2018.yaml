    This document (first level standard) is the main document among the others regarding human-life activity support systems and equipment integration in space flight.
    This document, along with second and third level standards, forms a complex three-level international standard entitled: Space systems — Human-life activity support systems and equipment integration in space flight.
    It is applicable to all human space flight programmes in all manned space objects, including space systems, space stations, lunar and planetary bases, as well as extravehicular activity. It covers all phases of development of a manned space object, such as design, production, tests, operation, and maintenance.
