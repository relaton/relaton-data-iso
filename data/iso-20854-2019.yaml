abstract:
- content: "This document describes the design of the mechanical refrigeration unit
    (MRU) and operation of container refrigerating systems in all anticipated operational
    modes and locations.\nIt describes the industry's best practices for the safe
    operation of flammable refrigerants in refrigerating systems used in thermal freight
    containers operated on board ships, in terminals, on road, on rail and on land.\nThis
    document addresses the use of flammable refrigerants with classifications defined
    in ISO 817, defined as 2L, 2 and 3, except R717 (Ammonia). \nThis document describes
    an operational mode risk assessment (OMRA) which uses methods such as HAZOP (Hazard
    and operability analysis), FMEA (Failure mode and effects analysis), or FTA (Fault
    tree analysis) or combination of methods.\nThis document specifies requirements
    for the validation and consideration of possible safety concepts and protective
    devices within the OMRA process, including charge release tests, simulation, and
    function tests of the associated protective equipment. It defines test requirements
    for shock, impact, and vibration. A validation procedure is given to demonstrate
    that risks from hazardous events are investigated and their severity and frequency
    are meaningfully reduced, with the aim of achieving tolerable risk values.\nThe
    obligations of the manufacturer, the container owner as well as the responsible
    operator are described, as well as how stakeholders can investigate and mitigate
    risks associated with the use of flammable refrigerants.\nFinally, this document
    describes the requirements of service and maintenance when working with flammable
    refrigerants.\nThis document is restricted to refrigerating systems integrated
    with or mounted on ISO thermal containers according to ISO 1496-2. It provides
    minimum requirements for reducing the risk associated with the use of flammable
    refrigerants.\nThe scope is limited to container refrigerating systems operated
    in conjunction with the carriage of refrigerated cargo as operating reefer (OR)
    or when used as a non-operating reefer (NOR) or when empty for positioning — while
    in intermodal transit. Static land-based continuous operations are excluded."
