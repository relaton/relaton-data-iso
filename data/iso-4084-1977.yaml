  content: Applies to contactors for use in nominal 28 V d. c. or 115/200 V three-phase,
    400 Hz a. c. systems having the characteristics specified in ISO 1540. Applies
    to contactors carrying loads greater than 1 kVA a. c. or 0,5 kW d. c. Three temperature
    classes and two types of sealing, environmentally sealed and enclosed, are specified.
    Is applicable to single-pole and multi-pole contactors, electromagnetically operated
    and magnetically held, or electromagnetically operated and mechanically or magnetically
    latched, controlled by a voltage of 28 V d. c. or 115 V, 400 Hz a. c.
