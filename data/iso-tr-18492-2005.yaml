abstract:
- content: |-
    ISO/TR 18492:2005 provides practical methodological guidance for the long-term preservation and retrieval of authentic electronic document-based information, when the retention period exceeds the expected life of the technology (hardware and software) used to create and maintain the information.
    It takes into account the role of technology-neutral information technology standards in supporting long-term access.
    This guidance also acknowledges that ensuring the long-term preservation and retrieval of authentic electronic document-based information should involve IT specialists, document managers, records managers and archivists.
    ISO/TR 18492:2005 does not cover processes for the creation, capture and classification of authentic electronic document-based information.
    This Technical Report applies to all forms of information generated by information systems and saved as evidence of business transactions and activities.
