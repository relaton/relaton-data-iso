- content: |-
    ISO/TR 17427-3:2015 provides the high-level generic requirements for the "Concept of operations" for a ?Core System' (CorSys) (3.10) to support C-ITS service delivery. It is intended as an input to the planning and development elaboration of core functions that will support the deployment of cooperative intelligent transport systems (C-ITS) in a connected vehicle-highway paradigm
    The objective of ISO/TR 17427-3:2015 is to raise awareness of and consideration of such issues and to give pointers, where appropriate, to standards existing that provide specifications for all or some of these aspects. This Technical Report does not provide specifications for solutions of these issues.
    ISO/TR 17427-3:2015 is agnostic in respect of technology and operates with whatever (and probably multiple) communications technologies and hardware technologies that can support its functionalities.
