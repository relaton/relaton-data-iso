  script: Latn
  content: "ISO/IEC TR 14652:2004 specifies a description format for the specification
    of cultural conventions, a description format for character sets, and a description
    format for binding character names to ISO/IEC 10646, plus a set of default values
    for some of these items. \nThe specification is upward compatible with POSIX locale
    specifications - a locale conformant to POSIX specifications will also be conformant
    to the specifications in ISO/IEC TR 14652:2004, while the reverse condition will
    not hold. The descriptions are intended to be coded in text files to be used via
    Application Programming Interfaces, that are expected to be developed for a number
    of systems which comply with ISO/IEC 9945. An alignment effort has been undertaken
    for this specification to be aligned with the revision of the ISO/IEC 9945 standard
    published in 2003."
