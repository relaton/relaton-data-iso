- content: |-
    This document gives guidelines for the corrosion testing of metals and alloys exposed in deep-sea water, including the selection of the test site, components and assembly of the test system, specimen preparation, testing procedure, evaluation after the retrieval from exposure sites and test report.
    This document is applicable to the general corrosion exposure testing of metals and alloys as well as localized corrosion tests such as stress corrosion cracking (SCC) testing, galvanic corrosion testing and crevice corrosion testing of specimens exposed in deep-sea water.
    Testing with exposure in deep sea of other materials such as composites and elastomers can also be carried out with reference to these guidelines, but the evaluation of these materials after the retrieval is different from that of metals and alloys.
    This document does not include the performance testing of sacrificial anodes for cathodic protection in the field of deep sea, which can be conducted using specified testing cells and equipment in the deep-sea exposure. However, this guidance can also provide useful information as reference for conducting performance testing of sacrificial anodes in deep-sea water.
