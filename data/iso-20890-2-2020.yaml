    This document gives guidelines for pre-service inspections (PSI) and in-service inspections (ISI) of the surfaces using the magnetic particle testing and penetrant testing on components of the reactor coolant circuit of light water reactors. This document is also applicable to other components of nuclear installations.
    Test systems for the localisation of surface inhomogeneities and requirements for test personnel, test devices, test media, accessories as well as optical auxiliaries, the preparation and implementation of the test as well as the recording are defined.
    NOTE 1  Data concerning the test section, test extent, inspection period, inspection interval and evaluation of indications are defined in the applicable national nuclear safety standards.
    NOTE 2  In general, this document is in accordance with ISO 3452 and ISO 9934 series. This document provides details to be considered in the standard test procedure (see Annex A).
