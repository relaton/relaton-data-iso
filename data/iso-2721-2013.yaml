abstract:
- content: "ISO 2721:2013 specifies the exposure at the focal plane of film-based
    cameras for values of two exposure parameters, i.e. field luminance and film speed,
    and also describes methods of evaluating other photometric characteristics, such
    as the acceptance angles of the photoelectric system.\nISO 2721:2013 applies to
    automatic exposure control systems which are built into film-based cameras or
    coupled with them to regulate the exposure in the focal plane as a function of
    the several exposure parameters. "
