  content: "ISO 12643-1:2009 provides safety specifications for the design and construction
    of new equipment used in prepress systems, printing press systems, binding and
    finishing systems, converting systems and stand‑alone platen presses. It is applicable
    to equipment used in a stand-alone mode, or in combination with other machines,
    including ancillary equipment, in which all the machine actuators (e.g. drives)
    of the equipment are controlled by the same control system.\nThe requirements
    given in ISO 12643-1:2009 are applicable to the equipment covered by all parts
    of ISO 12643, unless otherwise noted. ISO 12643-1:2009 is intended to be used
    in conjunction with the applicable part of ISO 12643 that contains additional
    requirements specific to a particular type of equipment. \nISO 12643-1:2009 addresses
    recognized significant hazards specific to equipment and systems in the following
    areas:\n- mechanical;\n- electrical;\n- slipping, tripping, falling;\n- ergonomics;\n-
    noise;\n- UV and laser radiation;\n- fire and explosion;\n- thermal;\n- other
    types of emissions [e.g. ozone, ink mist, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), etc.].\nThe
    safety principles established in ISO 12643-1:2009 can also be applicable to the
    design of equipment within areas of technology that are not specified in ISO 12643."
