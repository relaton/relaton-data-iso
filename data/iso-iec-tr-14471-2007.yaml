    Since CASE (computer aided software engineering) adoption is a subject of the broader technology transition problem, ISO/IEC TR 14471:2007 addresses the adoption practices appropriate for a wide range of computing organizations. ISO/IEC TR 14471:2007 neither dictates nor advocates particular development standards, software processes, design methods, methodologies, techniques, programming languages, or life-cycle paradigms.
    ISO/IEC TR 14471:2007 will:
    - identify critical success factors (CSF);
    - propose a set of adoption processes;
    - guide successful adoption in consideration of organizational and cultural environment.
    The following groups are targeted as potential audiences:
    - CASE users;
    - information systems managers;
    - chief information officers (CIO);
    - CASE suppliers;
    - software engineering consultants;
    - those involved in the acquisition of CASE tools and technology.
    Therefore ISO/IEC TR 14471:2007 addresses aspects of CASE tools adoption. It is best used in conjunction with ISO/IEC 14102 for CASE tool evaluation and selection. It is complementary to related ISO/IEC documents which deal with the general aspects of these topics.
    The purpose of ISO/IEC TR 14471:2007 is to provide a recommended practice for CASE adoption. It provides guidance in establishing processes and activities that are to be applied for the successful adoption of CASE technology. The use of ISO/IEC TR 14471:2007 will help to maximize the return and minimize the risk of investing in CASE technology. However, ISO/IEC TR 14471:2007 does not establish compliance criteria.
