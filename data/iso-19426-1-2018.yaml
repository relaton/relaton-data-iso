    This document specifies the terms and definitions related to the structures for mine shafts, used throughout ISO 19426.
    Terms used in mining can vary from conventional engineering usage, and they vary quite considerably between different countries. For this reason, alternative terms are provided in many of the entries. The preferred terms, given in bold type, are those used throughout ISO 19426.
    It is assumed that users of this document are familiar with mining, so common terms with normal dictionary usage are not defined. Also, no definitions are provided for terms that can be widely used in mining but are not explicitly used in ISO 19426.
