abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 15459-8:2009 specifies a unique, non-significant, string of characters
    for the unique identifier for grouping of transport units. The character string
    might be represented in a bar code label or other AIDC media associated with the
    items that make up the grouping to meet supply chain needs and regulatory needs
    (e.g. customs clearance). An individual instance of an entity is aptly identified
    by a unique identifier defined in other parts of ISO/IEC 15459. This relationship
    has to be communicated to the business partners according to the business need
    and the unique identifier for the grouping might be used as a reference number
    only or marked in addition to the existing identifier. To address management needs,
    different classes of items are recognized in the various parts of ISO/IEC 15459,
    which allows different requirements to be met by the unique identifiers associated
    with each class. ISO/IEC 15459-8:2009 defines the rules for the grouping of transport
    units to identify the multiple physical units that make up a single shipment from
    a consignor and are treated as a single logical grouping for customs and other
    shipping requirements.
