    ISO/TS 16688:2017 establishes a system to select coating types for architectural applications depending on environment. It gives guidelines for the selection of tests and methods of measuring performance in terms that are of direct interest to the building designer.
    ISO/TS 16688:2017 is applicable to organic and anodic oxidation (AAO) coatings on aluminium, including those produced from liquid and powder paints, and combined coatings of organic and anodic oxidation coatings. It is designed to be applicable to novel coatings developed in the future.
