    This document gives guidance based on ISO 50001:2018 to measure the status of energy management in an organization. The measurement results are described by using three scores: structure management score (SMS), operation management score (OMS) and target achievement score (TAS). This document presents methodologies on how the basic and advanced scores can be calculated.
    This document is applicable to organizations that are considering implementation, are implementing or have implemented an ISO 50001:2018 energy management system (EnMS) or any other system for energy management. It can be used to identify areas for improvement or to identify areas in which improvement has taken place.
    This document is applicable to any organization or association (e.g. national energy authorities, energy intensive industries implementing advanced energy management to small and medium enterprises) regardless of its type, size or complexity, etc. This document does not apply to countries, regions or cities.
    This document does not provide an interpretation of or modify the requirements of ISO 50001:2018.
