    ISO 3573:2008 applies to hot-rolled carbon steel sheet of commercial and drawing qualities.
    Hot-rolled steel sheet is suitable for many applications where the presence of oxide or scale, or normal surface imperfections disclosed after removal of oxide or scale, are not objectionable. It is not suitable for applications where surface is of prime importance.
    Steel sheet that is to be subjected to subsequent rerolling is not covered by this International Standard.
