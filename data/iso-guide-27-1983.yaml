abstract:
- content: The purpose of this Guide is to identify a series of procedures which a
    national certification body (non-governmental) should consider in deciding how
    to respond to a reported misuse of its registered mark of conformity (i.e. violation
    of a contract, inadequate quality control, or error in assessment of conformity)
    or a situation in which a certified product is subsequently found to be hazardous
    (i.e. due to inadequate standard, unanticipated end-use of a product or a manufacturing
    defect).
