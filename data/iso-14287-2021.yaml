  content: This document specifies requirements for some commonly used pad lining
    materials utilized on tilting pad bearings. The requirements in this document
    are expressed by specifying the chemical composition of the lining materials.
    Other lining materials can be used if they have been proven to be equally suitable
    at the required operating conditions. Descriptive characteristics of the lining
    materials are given along with the appropriate selection of pad backing and pivot
    materials.
