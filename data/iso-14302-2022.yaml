abstract:
- content: This document contains a process to establish performance requirements
    for the purpose of ensuring space systems electromagnetic compatibility (EMC).
    The engineering issues to be addressed in order to achieve system-level EMC are
    identified herein, with guidance and rationale towards achieving specification
    conformance. The method for the derivation of typical equipment-level requirements
    from a space-system-level requirement is illustrated. This document also aids
    in the selection of tailored requirements for a specific mission (see Annex A).
