  content: ISO 12345 specifies cleanliness assessment procedures for evaluating the
    amount of debris found within the constituent parts of a diesel fuel injection
    system that could lead to a reduction in the system's operational effectiveness.
    It is mainly concerned with new equipment not yet fitted to an engine, and is
    therefore aimed primarily at engine and fuel injection equipment manufacturers.
