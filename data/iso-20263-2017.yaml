  script: Latn
  content: ISO 20263:2017 specifies a procedure for the determination of averaged
    interface position between two different layered materials recorded in the cross-sectional
    image of the multi-layered materials. It is not intended to determine the simulated
    interface of the multi-layered materials expected through the multi-slice simulation
    (MSS) method. This document is applicable to the cross-sectional images of the
    multi-layered materials recorded by using a transmission electron microscope (TEM)
    or a scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) and the cross-sectional
    elemental mapping images by using an energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS)
    or an electron energy loss spectrometer (EELS). This document is also applicable
    to the digitized image recorded on an image sensor built into a digital camera,
    a digital memory set in the PC or an imaging plate and the digitalized image converted
    from an analogue image recorded on the photographic film by an image scanner.
