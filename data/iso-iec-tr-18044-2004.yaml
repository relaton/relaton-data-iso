  content: "ISO/IEC TR 18044:2004 provides advice and guidance on information security
    incident management for information security managers and for information system
    managers. \nISO/IEC TR 18044:2004 provides \n- information on the benefits to
    be obtained from and the key issues associated with a good information security
    incident management approach (to convince senior corporate management and those
    personnel who will report to and receive feedback from a scheme that the scheme
    should be introduced and used); \n- information on examples of information security
    incidents, and an insight into their possible causes;\n- a description of the
    planning and documentation required to introduce a good structured information
    security incident management approach; \n- a description of the information security
    incident management process*. \n* Quick, co-ordinated and effective responses
    to an information security incident require extensive technical and procedural
    preparations. Information security incident responses may consist of immediate,
    short- and long-term actions. Any actions undertaken as the response to an incident
    should be based on previously developed, documented and accepted security incident
    response procedures and processes, including those for post-response analysis."
