    This document specifies a method for the determination of total bound nitrogen (ST-TNb) in water of various origins: groundwater, surface water and wastewater, in a measuring range of concentration generally between 0,5 mg/l and 150 mg/l of ST-TNb using the small-scale sealed tube method. Different measuring ranges of small-scale sealed tube methods can be required.
    The measuring ranges can vary depending on the type of small-scale sealed tube method of different manufacturers.
    It is up to the user to choose the small-scale sealed tube test with the appropriate application range or to adapt samples with concentrations exceeding the measuring range of a test by preliminary dilution.
    NOTE      The results of a small-scale sealed tube test are most precise in the middle of the application range of the test.
    All small-scale sealed tube methods are based on a heated alkaline potassium persulfate oxidation in a heating block at 100 °C and different digestion times are applicable. Chromotropic colour reaction is applied, depending on the typical operating procedure of the small-scale sealed tube used, see Clause 9.
