- content: |-
    This document establishes guidelines for the design format and data content of an ISO-compliant driving licence (IDL) in regard to both visual human-readable features and ISO machine-readable technologies. It creates a common basis for international use and mutual recognition of the IDL without impeding individual national/community/regional motor vehicle authorities in taking care of their specific needs.
    The design approach of the IDL ISO ID-1 size card is to establish a secure domestic driving permit (DDP) for both human verification and machine readability and accompanying booklet with sleeve insert pocket for international use instead of the international driving permit (IDP) paper document (see Annex G).
    The basic document design premises include:
    —          A minimum common mandatory data element set.
    —          A common layout for ease of recognition.
    —          Minimum security requirements for both human and machine verification.
    —          Interoperability of the machine-readable content.
    At the discretion of national/community/regional motor vehicle authorities it allows for:
    —          Inclusion of supplementary optional data elements to meet the needs of specific national/community/regional requirements apart from the minimum common mandatory data element set.
    —          Additional document physical security elements at the option of national/community/regional authorities, and facilitates international procurements.
    —          Incorporation of ISO/IEC JTC1/SC17 machine-readable technologies including integrated circuit with contacts and contactless integrated circuit technology, and ISO/IEC JTC1/SC31 1-dimensional / 2-dimensional bar codes, at the option of national/community/regional authorities.
    —          Incorporation of current and future technologies (including biometrics, cryptography, data compression) at the option of national/community/regional authorities.
    A major benefit of these design premises is that a single card may serve a dual purpose of both a national/community/regional licence as well as an internationally recognized licence. Therefore, one card, in most cases, can replace the need for two documents. Alternatively, those countries that choose to maintain their individual domestic design or not to use Latin characters on their domestic driving licence for example can issue a second card with or without ISO machine-readable technologies. This second card can serve as DDP to be used with the accompanying booklet with sleeve insert pocket for international use instead of the current IDP paper document.
    This new IDL design yields a document that:
    —          Is more secure from counterfeiting and alteration than the previous DDP and IDP documents.
    —          Allows authorities to verify the authenticity of the document.
    —          Integrates the personal data into a secure ID-1 size medium.
    —          Allows a more reliable identification of the licence holder.
    —          Allows for machine-readable technologies.
    —          Facilitates information exchange and mutual recognition among motor vehicle authorities.
    —          Allows the IDL to serve simultaneously as a DDP and IDP when accompanied by the booklet.
    Issuing authorities may introduce other functions to an IDL provided that it does not interfere with the driving licence function and the requirements in this document are not compromised.
