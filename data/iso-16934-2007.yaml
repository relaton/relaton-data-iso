    ISO 16934:2007 specifies a shock tube test method and classification requirements for explosion-pressure-resistant glazing, including glazing fabricated from glass, plastic, glass-clad plastics, laminated glass, glass/plastic glazing materials, and film-backed glass. ISO 16934:2007 provides a structured procedure to determine the blast resistance and the hazard rating of glazing and glazing systems. ISO 16934:2007 sets out procedures to classify such security glazing sheet materials by means of tests on specimens of a standard size in a standard frame for the purpose of comparing their relative explosion resistance and hazard rating.
    The procedures and test method can also be used to test, but not classify, glazing systems where the sheet in-fill is incorporated into frames purposely designed as complete products of appropriate size for installation into buildings. ISO 16934:2007 applies a method of test and classifications against blast waves generated in a shock tube facility to simulate high-explosive detonations of approximately 30 kg to 2 500 kg TNT at distances from about 35 m to 50 m. The classifications approximately represent the reflected pressures and impulses that are experienced by these equivalent threat levels on the face of a large building facade positioned perpendicular to the path of the blast waves.
    Classification is defined in terms of both blast shock-wave characteristics, expressed in terms of peak reflected pressure, impulse, positive phase duration and wave-form parameter (decay coefficient), and rating criteria, expressed in terms of degrees of glazing damage and fragment impact hazard. Classifications and ratings are assigned based upon the performance of the glazing and are specific to the blast characteristics under which the test has taken place. Glazing that has received an air-blast classification and rating is suitable for use in blast-resistant applications only for blasts of comparable characteristics and only if installed in a properly designed frame. Design based on knowledge of the air blast resistance reduces the risk of personal injury.
