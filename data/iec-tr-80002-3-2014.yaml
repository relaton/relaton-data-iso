abstract:
- content: "IEC TR 80002-3:2014 which is a technical report (TR), provides the description
    of software life cycle processes for medical devices. The medical device software
    life cycle processes are derived from IEC 62304:2006, with corresponding safety
    classes. They have been aligned with the software development life cycle processes
    of ISO/IEC 12207:2008 and are presented herein in full compliance with ISO/IEC
    24774:2010. The content of these three standards provides the foundation of this
    TR. This TR does not:           - address areas already covered by existing related
    standards, e.g. the international standards that relate to the four standards
    used to build this TR (see Bibliography);                    \n- FDA guidance
    documents; or                            \n- software development tools. This
    TR describes the process reference model for medical device software development
    and is limited in scope to the life cycle processes described in IEC 62304:2006.
    The process names correspond to those of IEC 62304:2006. The mappings provided
    in Annex B are essential for the alignment between IEC 62304:2006 (which is based
    on ISO/IEC 12207:1995) and ISO/IEC 12207:2008, developed to address the detailed
    normative relationship between the two standards. This technical report is not
    intended to be used as the basis of regulatory inspection or certification assessment
    activities."
