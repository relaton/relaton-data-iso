    This document is applicable to Very Small Entities (VSEs). A VSE is an enterprise, an organization, a department or a project having up to 25 people.
    The purpose of this document is to provide a set of auditable requirements based on multiple standards (i.e., ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288, ISO/IEC/IEEE 15289, ISO 9000, ISO 9001, ISO 31000, ISO/IEC 38500, ISO 10004, ISO 10007, ISO/IEC 20000, ISO/IEC 27035) that supports the delivery of services by a VSE. Services can be delivered to internal or external customers. This document is not a Management System Standard (MSS), nor does it provide guidance on fulfilling the requirements of an MSS. ISO/IEC 20000-1:2011 is the MSS for service management (see Annex D for information).
    This document does not promote uniformity in the approach across all organizations, as specific objectives and initiatives are tailored to suit an individual organization's needs.
