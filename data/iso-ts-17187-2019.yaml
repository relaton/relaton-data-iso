  content: This document provides governance rules to be used for executing an organized
    process for business entities to connect to one another electronically for the
    conduct of electronic trade in a secure and open environment through a standardized
    framework for information exchange. This standardized framework includes processes
    and process tools to ease connections between trading partners, to provide full
    visibility, and to reduce the time goods spend in transit. The application of
    these rules and attendant standards and technology applications are expected to
    allow business entities to engage their legacy systems without the cost of upgrades.
