- content: |-
    ISO 19697:2016 specifies the performance requirements, methods of testing and test results of electronic inclinometers required by the performance standard, IMO resolution MSC.363 (92), in addition to the general requirements contained in resolution A.694 (17) and is associated with IEC 60945.
    The electronic inclinometers provide information about actual heel angle, roll amplitude, roll period to support decision-making process on board in order to avoid dangerous situations, in stability (see Annex A for information), as well as to assist in maritime casualty investigation. The electronic inclinometers are mainly composed of a set of sensors, a signal processor, a display, an input device and an interface to other systems.
    It does not apply to the electronic inclinometers installed for purposes which are outside the scope of this document, e.g. monitoring of cargo status.
    Where a requirement in this document is different from IEC 60945, the requirement in this document takes precedence.
