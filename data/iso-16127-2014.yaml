abstract:
- content: "ISO 16127:2014 defines the requirements to reduce the risk of in-orbit
    break-up of unmanned spacecraft, both during and after their operational lives.
    The aim would be met by reducing the possibility of a break-up caused by an unplanned
    internally caused event and by depleting to a safe level all the sources of stored
    energy at the end of a spacecraft's life. ISO 16127:2014 is designed for use in
    planning, verifying and implementing the prevention of break-up of a spacecraft.\nISO
    16127:2014 applies only to unmanned spacecraft operating in Earth orbit. "
