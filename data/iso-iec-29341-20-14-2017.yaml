  content: "ISO/IEC 29341-20-14:2017 is compliant with the UPnP Device Architecture
    version 1.0 [14]. It defines a service type referred to herein as ScheduledRecording
    service. \nThe ScheduledRecording service is a UPnP service that allows control
    points to schedule the recording of content. Generally, this content is broadcast
    content, but this specification does not limit itself to broadcast content. This
    service type enables the following functions:\n-           Create a recordSchedule
    so that it is added to the list of recordSchedule instances. Each recordSchedule
    describes user-level recording instructions for the ScheduledRecording service.\n-
    \          Browse a list of recordSchedule instances stored by the ScheduledRecording
    service.\n-           Delete a recordSchedule so that it is removed from the list
    of recordSchedule instances.\n-           Browse a list of recordTask instances,
    stored by the ScheduledRecording service. The ScheduledRecording service may create
    zero or more recordTask instances for each recordSchedule. A recordTask represents
    a discrete recording operation of a recordSchedule.\n-           Enable or disable
    individual recordTask instances.\n-           Enable or disable a recordSchedule.\n-
    \          Receive notifications i ndicating change of recordSchedule or recordTask
    list.\nThe ScheduledRecording service does not require a dependency on any UPnP
    services other than a co-located ContentDirectory service, which provides the
    following functions:\n-           A ContentDirectory service provides channel
    line-up to allow users to find recordable channels. A control point may use this
    metadata when creating a recordSchedule on a ScheduledRecording service.\n-           A
    ContentDirectory service may provide Electronic Program Guide (EPG) features to
    allow users to find recordable content. A control point may use this metadata
    when creating a recordSchedule on a ScheduledRecording service.\n-           Contents
    recorded by the ScheduledRecording service may be exposed by a ContentDirectory
    service.\nThe architectural relationship among the different concepts, defined
    by the ScheduledRecording service can be summarized as follows: A ScheduledRecording
    service owns a flat (that is: non-nested) list of recordSchedule instances, meaning
    that the ScheduledRecording service may create, destroy, or change recordSchedule
    instances. A recordSchedule represents user-level instructions to perform recording
    operations. Generally, a user constructs his instructions to a ScheduledRecording
    service via a control point that invokes UPnP actions that affect the list of
    recordSchedule instances. In all cases, the ScheduledRecording service shall be
    able to describe discrete recording operations for a recordSchedule through a
    list of associated recordTask instances. A recordTask can only exist with a recordSchedule
    (that is: never orphaned). Thus when a recordTask is created by the ScheduledRecording
    service, its lifetime depends on its parent recordSchedule. An individual recordTask
    can be selectively enabled or disabled. \nThis service template does not address:\nImplementations
    where the ScheduledRecording service and its associated ContentDirectory service
    are not co-located in the same device."
