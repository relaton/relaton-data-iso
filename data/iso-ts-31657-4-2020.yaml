    This document establishes the permissible operational parameters in terms of guide values for the calculation of selected multi-lobed and tilting-pad journal bearings.
    In order to attain a sufficient operational safety of multi-lobed and tilting-pad journal bearings by the calculation according to ISO/TS 31657-1, it is necessary for the operational characteristic value hmin to be significantly above the permissible operating parameter hlim,tr and for the permissible operating parameters Tlim and plim not to be exceeded by the calculated operational characteristic values Tmax and pmax.
    The guide values represent geometrically and technologically founded operational limiting values in the tribological system of plain bearings.
    They are empirical values that enable sufficient operational safety even in the event of smaller disturbing influences (see ISO/TS 31657-1). The empirical values indicated can be modified for special application areas.
    NOTE    The explanations for the symbols and calculation examples are contained in ISO/TS 31657-1.
