    This document specifies requirements for the maximum amount and, in some cases, the maximum concentration of certain substances and mixtures used in experimental sets for chemistry and related activities.
    These substances and mixtures are:
    —          those classified as dangerous by the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals (GHS)[1];
    —          substances and mixtures which in excessive amounts could harm the health of the children using them and which are not classified as dangerous by the GHS; and
    —          any other chemical substance(s) and mixture(s) delivered with the experimental set.
    This document applies to experimental sets for chemistry and related activities, including crystal-growing sets, carbon-dioxide-generating experimental sets and supplementary sets. It also covers sets for chemical experiments within the fields of mineralogy, biology, physics, microscopy and environmental science, whenever they contain one or more chemical substances and/or mixtures which are classified as hazardous according to the GHS[1].
    This document also specifies requirements for marking, a contents list, instructions for use, eye protection and the equipment intended for carrying out the experiments.
    Requirements for certain other chemical toys are given in ISO 8124-11.
