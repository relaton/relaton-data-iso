    ISO/TS 17938:2014 defines the structure of the semantic network by describing the semantic types and semantic relations of TCM language system.
    ISO/TS 17938:2014 is intended to:
    a)    support establishment of Unified Semantic Modelling TCM Language System;
    b)    support develop of standardized TCM concepts and relationships of concepts;
    c)    provide a conceptual framework for the concept representation of TCM Language;
    d)    provide the minimal coding for the semantic network structure;
    e)    support improvement in the processing of natural language by computer systems.
    ISO/TS 17938:2014 has been developed for the first time. The initial content described within it is intended to be used as a starting point for the application of the content in the information system.
