abstract:
- content: Applies to cold-reduced steel sheet of higher strength which is made from
    killed steel, and may contain phosphorus up to 0,12 % (m/m) maximum. Intended
    for applications where parts are to be fabricated requiring better formability
    than is provided by normal high yield strength steel sheet. Suitable for applications
    where the surface of the sheet is of prime importance.
