    This document specifies the requirements of the fitness for the purpose of pipes and/or fittings assemblies made from polyethylene with glass fibre (PE-sGF) piping system manufactured by spiral cross winding method for below ground for the conveyance of fluids for industrial and agricultural use:
    ¾      chemical plant;
    ¾      industrial sewerage engineering;
    ¾      power engineering (cooling and general-purpose water supply);
    ¾      agricultural production plants;
    ¾      water treatment;
    ¾      small hydraulic power plant (general-purpose water supply);
     This document also specifies the test parameters for the test methods referred to in this International Standard.
    In conjunction with other parts of the ISO PAS 22101-1, ISO PAS 22101-2 and ISO/DPAS 22101-3, this document applies to PE pipes, fittings, their joints and to joints with components of PE and other materials, intended to be used under it applies to PE-sGF pipes, fittings, their joints and joints with components of PE-sGF and other materials intended to be used under the following conditions:
    a)     allowable operating pressure (PFA) up to and including 25 bar;
    b)     operating temperature of 20 °C as the reference temperature.
    NOTE  1   For other operating temperatures, guidance is given in ISO PAS 22101-1, Annex A.
