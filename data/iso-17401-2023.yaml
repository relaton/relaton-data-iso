- content: |-
    This document provides spacecraft (SC) organizations with the general format for presenting the interface requirement document (IRD) for launch vehicle services. The IRD provides a list of the major technical requirements spacecraft agencies provide to launch vehicle (LV) agencies when submitting an application for launch services.
    The IRD addresses the definition of the SC mission, the mechanical and electrical interfaces, the overall environment requirements (mechanical, thermal, cleanliness, radio-electrical), the SC development and test programme and, finally, launch range facilities and support requirements.
    This document is applicable to all existing commercial LV and related launch facilities so as to permit SC contractors to prepare a single interface requirement document for a given SC mission, independently of the LV contractor to be selected.
    The IRD, as defined in this document, includes the basic SC input data needed by LV agencies to prepare the interface control document defined in ISO 15863.
