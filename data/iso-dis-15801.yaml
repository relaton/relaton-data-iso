    This document specifies the implementation and operation of information management systems that stores and make available for use electronically stored information (ESI) in a trustworthy and reliable manner. Such ESI can be of any type, including “page based” information, information in databases and audio/video information.
    This document is for use by any organization that uses information management systems to store trustworthy ESI over time.  Such systems incorporate policies, procedures, technology and audit requirements that ensure that trustworthiness of the ESI is maintained.
    This document does not cover processes used to evaluate whether ESI can be considered to be trustworthy prior to it being stored or imported into the system. However, it can be used to demonstrate that, once the electronic information is stored, output from the system will be a true and accurate reproduction of the ESI created and/or imported.
