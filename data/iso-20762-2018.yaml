    This document specifies measurement methods for the maximum system propulsion power of hybrid-electric vehicles (HEV).
    The results can be compared with the data of internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEV) power measured with the relevant current method.
    NOTE       ISO 1585 and UN Regulation No. 85, for example.
    This document applies only to the vehicles with the following characteristics:
    —          HEVs with an internal combustion engine (ICE) and one or more electric motors powered by one or more rechargeable energy storage systems (RESS) for propulsion;
    —          vehicles classified as passenger cars or light duty trucks.
