    ISO 14347:2008 gives recommendations for the design and analysis of unstiffened, welded, nodal joints in braced structures composed of hollow sections of circular or square shape (with or without rectangular chord) under fatigue loading.
    ISO 14347:2008 applies to structures: fulfilling quality requirements for hollow sections; complying with recommended weld details; employing permitted steel grades; having hollow section joints; having either square or rectangular hollow sections with a thickness between 4 mm and 16 mm, or circular hollow sections with a thickness between 4 mm and 50 mm; having as stress range the range of “hot-spot” stress; having identical brace (branch) members.
    ISO 14347:2008 applies to both hot-finished and cold-formed steel structural hollow sections, complying with the applicable national manufacturing specification, that fulfil specified quality requirements.
    ISO 14347:2008 applies to joints consisting of circular hollow sections (CHS) or rectangular hollow sections (RHS) as used in uniplanar or multiplanar trusses or girders, such as T-, Y-, X-, K-, XX-, and KK-joints.
