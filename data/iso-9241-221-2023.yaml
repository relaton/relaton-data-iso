    This document specifies the process references model (PRM) for human-centred design (HCD) according to ISO 9241-220, as well as the process assessment model (PAM) for assessing these processes, based on ISO/IEC 33020 and in accordance with the requirements of ISO/IEC 33004.
    This HCD PAM contains a set of indicators to be considered while interpreting the intent of the HCD PRM defined in ISO 9241-220. These indicators can also be applied when implementing a process improvement programme post an assessment.
    NOTE 1        The PRM in this document focuses on assessing HCD processes rather than system life cycle, for example as in ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288, or software life cycle, as in ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207.
    NOTE 2        If processes beyond the scope of ISO 9241-220 are required, appropriate processes from other PRMs, such as ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207, ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 or ISO/TS 18152, can be added based on the business needs of the organization.
    The intended application of this document is computer-based interactive systems. While the processes apply to interactive systems that deliver services, they do not cover the design of those services. The relevant aspects of the processes can also be applied to simple or non-computer-based interactive systems.
    NOTE 3        HCD concentrates on the human-centred aspects of design and not on other aspects of design, such as mechanical construction, programming or the basic design of services.
    The process descriptions in this document provide the basis for a rigorous assessment of an enterprise’s capability to carry out human-centred processes in conformity with the ISO/IEC 33004 and ISO/IEC 33020.
    This document is intended for use by organizations that want to address and improve their treatment of human-centred design of either their internal systems or the products and services they provide, and the procurement of systems and parts of systems. The processes can be applied by small- and medium-sized enterprises as well as by large organizations.
    NOTE 4        The scope of application of the PAM is the same as that of the PRM, which is described in ISO 9241-220:2019, Clause 1.
