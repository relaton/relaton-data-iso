abstract:
- content: Applicable to products having a S compounds content, expressed as sulphate,
    of equal to or more than 5 mg/kg. Bases of progressive neutralization, with evolution
    of carbon dioxide, by adding slowly a mixture of hydriodic acid and hypophosphoruos
    acid. Reduction of the compounds to hydrogen sulphide by heating. Distilation
    of the hydrogen sulfide, entrainment in a flow of oxygen-free nitrogen and absorption
    in a mixture of acetone and sodium hydroxide solution. Titration of the sulphide
    with standard volumetric mercury(II) nitrate solution in the presence of dithizone
    as indicator. Has also been approved by the IUPAC.
