abstract:
- content: "This document defines system engineering and management requirements for
    the life cycle of websites, including strategy, design, engineering, testing and
    validation, and management and sustainment for intranet and extranet environments.
    This document applies to those using web technology to present information and
    communications technology (ICT) information, such as information for users of
    systems and services, plans and reports for systems and software engineering projects,
    and documentation of policies, plans, and procedures for IT service management.
    This document provides requirements for website owners and website providers,
    managers responsible for establishing guidelines for website development and operations,
    website engineers, designers, developers, and operations and maintenance staff,
    who can be external or internal to the website owner's organization. It applies
    to websites for public access and for limited access, such as for users, customers,
    and subscribers seeking information on IT systems, products and services.\nThe
    requirements and recommendations in this document address the following aspects
    of usability of informational websites and ease of maintenance of managed website
    operations:\na)       locating relevant and timely information;\nb)       applying
    information security management;\nc)        facilitating accessibility and ease
    of use;\nd)       providing for consistent and efficient development and maintenance
    practices.\nThis document is not particularly applicable to websites used primarily
    for marketing or sales, to deliver instructional material (tutorials), or to provide
    graphical user interfaces (GUI) for business or consumer transactional application
    processing. However, this document can provide useful insights for managing such
    sites.\nThis document does not address vendor and product considerations for website
    engineering and management. This document does not include specifications for
    application development tools, programming and scripting languages used for websites,
    metadata tags, or protocols for network communications. It does not address tools
    or systems used for management or storage of information content (data, documents)
    that can be presented on websites. \nThis document does not address the design
    and architecture of software and systems supporting the Internet."
