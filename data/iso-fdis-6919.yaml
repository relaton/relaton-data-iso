abstract:
- content: The proposed document defines procedures and requirements for transporting
    liquefied natural gas(LNG) from trucks to ships (TTS) using the combination of
    Coriolis mass flowmeter (MFM) and gaschromatograph (GC). It also gives guidance
    for portable packaging of the combination system in mobileform which minimizes
    facility storage space and streamline the use of development systems. Outputfrom
    the system in calorie units is applicable to commercial transactions between suppliers
    and usersof liquefied natural gas (LNG) as marine fuel.The proposed document consists
    of definitions of related terms, abbreviations, general requirements,metrological
    requirements, system flawless requirements, requirements and test methods, procedures,and
    appendices for measurement methods.
