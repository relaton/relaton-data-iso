    This document specifies the basic specifications and testing requirements for series 1 freight containers of the dry bulk container non-pressurized type which are suitable for international exchange and for conveyance by road, rail and sea, including interchange between these forms of transport.
    As the density and flow characteristics of dry bulk cargoes vary widely, containers conforming to this document are not expected to be suitable for the carriage of all such cargoes. Therefore, except where otherwise stated, the requirements of this document are minimum requirements.
    The container types covered by this document are given in Table 1.
    This document does not apply to BK3 flexible bulk containers.
