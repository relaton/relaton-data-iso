    ISO 22514-3:2008 prescribes the steps to be taken in conducting short-term performance studies that are typically performed on machines where parts produced consecutively under repeatability conditions are considered. The number of observations to be analysed will vary according to the patterns the data produce, or if the runs (the rate at which items are produced) on the machine are low in quantity. The methods are not recommended where the sample size produced is less than 30 observations. Methods to be used for handling the data and carrying out the calculations are described. In addition, machine performance indices and the actions required at the conclusion of a machine performance study are described.
    ISO 22514-3:2008 is not applicable when tool wear patterns are expected to be present during the duration of the study, nor if autocorrelation between observations is present. The situation where a machine has captured the data, sometimes thousands of data points collected in a minute, is not considered suitable for the application of ISO 22514-3:2008.
