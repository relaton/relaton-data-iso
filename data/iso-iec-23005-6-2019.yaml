    This document provides definitions of data types and tools, which are used in other parts of the ISO/IEC 23005 series, but are not specific to a single part.
    This document specifies syntax and semantics of the data types and tools common to the tools defined in the other parts of the ISO/IEC 23005 series, such as basic data types which are used as basic building blocks in more than one of the tools in the ISO/IEC 23005 series, colour-related basic types which are used in light and colour‑related tools to help in specifying colour-related characteristics of the devices or commands, and time stamp types which can be used in device commands, and sensed information to specify timing related information.
    Classification schemes, which provide semantics of words or terms and normative way of referencing them, are also defined in Annex A, if they are used in more than one part of the ISO/IEC 23005 series.
    The tools defined in this document are not intended to be used alone, but to be used as a part or as a supporting tool of other tools defined in other parts of the ISO/IEC 23005 series, except for the profile and level definitions.
    This document also contains standard profiles and levels to be used in specific application domains. The profile and level definitions include collection of tools from ISO/IEC 23005-2 and ISO/IEC 23005-5 with necessary constraints.
