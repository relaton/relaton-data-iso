abstract:
- content: "ISO 20077-1:2017 defines the concepts and the terms related to extended
    vehicles.\nISO 20077-1:2017 presents general information regarding these vehicles,
    specifies the dedicated terminology and describes the interrelation with other
    standards related to extended vehicles.\nISO 20077-1:2017 concerns:\n-      road
    vehicles with four or more wheels designed and constructed primarily for the carriage
    of persons that are defined as Category 1 vehicles in the United Nations Special
    Resolution No.1 in TRANS/WP.29/1045, as last amended on 19 June 2012; \n-      road
    vehicles with four or more wheels designed and constructed primarily for the carriage
    of goods that are defined as Category 2 vehicles in the United Nations Special
    Resolution No.1 in TRANS/WP.29/1045, as last amended on 19 June 2012,\nwhere these
    road vehicles are still in accordance with the specifications of the vehicle manufacturer.\nWhile
    this document mentions already standardized interfaces and devices (e.g. external
    test equipment) connected to these interfaces, the specification of these interfaces
    and devices is not within the scope of this document."
