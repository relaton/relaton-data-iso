abstract:
- content: |-
    ISO 30021:2013 specifies a method of determining the fire resistance of non-load-bearing separating elements made of fibre reinforced plastics (FRP) when exposed to heating on one face.
    It is applicable to FRP products for which the end-use application is smaller than the full-scale fire test specimen specified in ISO 834‑1. Fire barriers in transportation applications are a common example, since the end-use dimensions of the barrier products are often smaller than those specified in ISO 834‑1.
    This test is, in general, applicable to FRP products which have an essentially flat surface and can have stiffening members. This includes sandwich-panel-type structures in which the skins consist of FRP.
