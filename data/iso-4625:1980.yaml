  content: Specifies a method of test for resins (including rosin) and similar materials
    by means of the ring-and-ball apparatus. In general, with materials of this type,
    softening does not take place at a definite temperature. As the temperature rises,
    these materials gradually and imperceptibly change from brittle or exceedingly
    thick and slow-flowing materials to softer and less viscous liquids. For this
    reason, the determination must be made by a fixed, arbirary, and closely defined
    method.
