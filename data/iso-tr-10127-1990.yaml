abstract:
- content: The major differences between the manual drawing practice and the CAD technique
    are identified, and an attempt is made to rationalize the use of the CAD technique
    in the construction industry. The layout of a drawing system using this technique
    is outlined in figure 1. Limitations of the manual and automated computer-aided
    systems are indicated as well as their similarities, differences and correlation.
    A glossary of terms is included.
