    This document (all parts) specifies methods to determine chemical emission rates of analytes from ICT & CE equipment during intended operation in an Emission Test Chamber (ETC).
    This document (all parts) includes specific methods for equipment using consumables, such as printers, and equipment not using consumables, such as monitors and PC’s.
    Part 1 specifies the methods to determine the emission rates of VOC and carbonyl compounds, ozone, particulate matter, fine particles (FP) and ultra-fine particles (UFP) from electronic equipment using consumables.
    The methods comprise preparation, sampling (or monitoring) in a controlled ETC, storage and analysis, calculation and reporting of emission rates.
    Part 1 has two different methods for the determination of emission rates of VOC and carbonyl compounds. The two methods use two different emission models, the quasi-equilibrium model (QEM) and the constant emission model (CEM) respectively, to determine the emission rates of VOC and carbonyl compounds during the pre-operating phase.
    The quasi-equilibrium model method has been developed with hard copy devices for office or home use in mind whose energy-saving modes automatically activate during most intervals between operations. The calculation of emission rates during the pre-operating phase is based on the quasi-equilibrium assumption as shown in Annex C.
    The emission rates determined with this method can be used to compare equipment in the same class since test procedures are specified more narrowly than the other method (CEM).
    The constant emission model (CEM) has been developed for hard copy devices whose energy-saving modes have such a negligible effect on the determination of emission rates of VOC and carbonyl compounds that the generalised constant emission model shown in Annex D can be used for the determination of their emission rates during the pre-operating phase. This method presents more flexible test procedures than the QEM. Due to such features of this method, it may be used for hard copy devices whose idling mode usually lasts throughout intervals between operations, such as large hard copy devices used professionally. It may also be used for various equipment having different functions and structure for its intended use and the determination of carbonyl compounds requiring longer sampling duration due to a lack of sensitivity.
    Annex A specifies monochrome and colour print patterns for use in the operating phase of EUT using consumables.
    The operational readiness of AMS is confirmed according to Annex B.
    Predictions of “real indoor” concentrations from the determined emission rates are outside the scope of this document.
