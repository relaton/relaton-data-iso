  content: Procedure given applies to gases, such as propane, butane or mixtures thereof.
    It is suitable for sampling into containers to provide samples for laboratory
    testing of products covered by ISO 9162. Although this procedures can be used
    to provide samples for compositional analysis, it is strongly recommended that
    alternative apparatus, such as a variable-volume container, be used to minimize
    compositional changes that may occur.
