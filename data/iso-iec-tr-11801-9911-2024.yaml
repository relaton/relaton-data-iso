    This document, which is a Technical Report,
    a) describes the rules of implementation of balanced single pair as described by ISO/IEC 11801-6:2017/AMD1:202x within a balanced 4- pair cabling system with a current carrying capacity of 0,75 A per conductor;
    b) describes the use of components and cabling to implement and configure according to ISO/IEC 11801-6:2017/AMD1:202x
    c) describes links and components for generic single pair channels according to ISO/IEC 11801-1:2017/AMD1:202x. Particular areas of interest are:
    • remote powering according to IEEE Std 802.3, Clause 104
    • loop resistance, max. current • insertion loss
    • return loss • noise considerations • frequency range requirements (low and high)
    • length calculation of the SCP-Link-4-pair-cable
    • number of channels
    d) describes the use of application specific single pair channels in addition to ISO/IEC 11801:2017/AMD1:202x, 6.6.4
    e) describes guidance on single pair remote powering applications when using 4-pair cabling with current carrying capacity specified
    f) describes guidelines for planning, administration and installation
