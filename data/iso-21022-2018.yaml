    This document specifies a test method for evaluating flexural performance of fibre-reinforced cementitious composites (FRCCs) using derived parameters. These parameters are derived from the load-deflection curve obtained by testing a circular specimen supported on a concentric ring and loaded by another ring with a smaller diameter. The performance of FRCCs tested by this method is characterized for biaxial properties.
    This test method provides for the determination of first-cracking load and the corresponding stress. It also provides for the determination of specimen toughness based on the area under the load-deflection curve up to the deflections at the first-cracking and peak loads. For determining the toughness value, this test method is intended primarily for use with FRCCs that exhibit deflection hardening behaviour. This test method is not intended for materials that exhibit deflection-softening behaviour.
