abstract:
- content: This document provides a mapping from ISO/IEC 11179-34 registrations of
    computable data into IEEE 2791 Standard for Bioinformatics Analyses Generated
    by High-Throughput Sequencing (HTS) to facilitate producing an instance of the
    metadata in JSON format. This document is applicable to those who are submitting
    data that comply with IEEE 2791 specification.
