    This document specifies a mapping of EXPRESS (ISO 10303–11) constructs to SysML constructs for the purpose of representing EXPRESS schemas in SysML models. The specified mapping is a one-way transformation from an EXPRESS schema to a SysML information model.
    The following are within the scope of this document:
    —    the specification of the transformation of EXPRESS constructs to SysML constructs represented in CXMI;
    —    the specification of the transformation of EXPRESS UNIQUE rules to SysML constructs represented in CXMI;
    —    the specification of the transformation of derived attributes to implement renaming to SysML constructs represented in CXMI.
    The following are outside the scope of this document:
    —    the transformation of EXPRESS elements into SysML metamodel constructs that are not used in the STEP Extended Architecture;
    —    transformation of EXPRESS FUNCTIONS;
    —    transformation of EXPRESS-G to SysML diagrams;
    —    tools, codes, and scripts to transform an EXPRESS schema to SysML CXMI;
    —    transformation of EXPRESS interface specification;
    —    SysML constraints transformation from EXPRESS DERIVE attributes, except the ones used for renaming;
    —    SysML constraints transformation from EXPRESS SUPERTYPE expressions;
    —    SysML constraints transformation from EXPRESS GLOBAL rules;
    —    SysML constraints transformation from EXPRESS WHERE rules.
    NOTE      EXPRESS DERIVE attributes, EXPRESS SUPERTYPE expressions, EXPRESS GLOBAL rules and EXPRESS WHERE rules are transformed into OCL specifications. OCL specifications are integrated in the SysML model based on a separate process.
