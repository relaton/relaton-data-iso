    This document specifies the minimum requirements for steel sheet, in coils and cut lengths, metallic-coated by the continuous hot-dip process, with zinc-aluminium-magnesium alloy coating.
    The product is intended for applications requiring high corrosion resistance, formability and paintability.
    The steel sheet is produced in a number of quality designations and grades, coating type, coating mass, surface treatments and coating finish conditions designed to be compatible with differing application requirements.
