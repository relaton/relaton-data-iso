    ISO 11142:2005 applies the exposure technique to the preparation of line originals and test charts, to their exposure on film including the necessary test originals and to the evaluation of test exposures on colour microfilm.
    In addition, ISO 11142:2005 applies to the exposure technique and the evaluation of available continuous-tone originals, ready to be microfilmed.
    ISO 11142:2005 is intended to contribute to a reproducible colour rendition with respect to the original. As far as process control is concerned, the film manufacturer's recommendation should be observed.
    ISO 11142:2005 does not take into account the influences of projection characteristics of microfilm readers on the subjective impression of projected colour microfilms.
