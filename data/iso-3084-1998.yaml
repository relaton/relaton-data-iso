  content: "This International Standard specifies experimental methods for the evaluation
    of quality variation of iron ores for each type of iron ore being traded and for
    each handling plant.\nTwo distinct approaches are specified. The first is to analyse
    interleaved samples composed of a number of paired increments taken and combined
    alternately following stratified sampling or systematic sampling as specified
    in ISO 3082. The second is to collect and analyse individual increments and then
    to analyse the data using variographic methods.\nUsing interleaved samples involves
    less work, but use of variograms provides a better estimate of quality variation
    and hence a better estimate of the sampling variance. The variogram method is
    usually used to fine tune a sampling operation. \nNOTE The experimental methods
    may be applied approximately to time basis sampling when the flowrate is almost
    uniform."
