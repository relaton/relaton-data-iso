  content: The principle of the method specified is exposing and processing samples
    as specified, obtaining density measurements from the resultant images to produce
    a sensitometric curve from which values are taken and used to determine ISO speed
    and ISO range. The method applies to vesicular microfilms which have their principal
    spectral sensitivity in the region of 350 nm to 450 nm and are used to produce
    negative-appearing images from positive originals and positive-appearing images
    from negative originals.
