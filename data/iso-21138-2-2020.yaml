    This document, together with ISO 21138-1, specifies the definitions and requirements for pipes with smooth external and internal surfaces (Type A), fittings and systems based on unplasticized poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC-U), polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene (PE) structured-wall piping systems intended to be used in non-pressure underground drainage and sewerage applications.
    NOTE 1    Pipes, fittings and the system complying with this document can also be used for highway drainage and surface water.
    This document specifies test methods and test parameters.
    This document covers a range of pipe and fitting sizes, materials, pipe constructions and nominal ring stiffnesses, and gives recommendations concerning colours.
    NOTE 2    It is the responsibility of the purchaser or specifier to make the appropriate selections from these aspects, taking into account their particular requirements and installation practices or codes.
    In conjunction with ISO 21138-1, this document is applicable to structured-wall pipes and fittings, to their joints and to joints with components of other plastics and non-plastics materials.
    It is applicable to pipes and fittings with or without an integral socket with elastomeric ring seal joints as well as welded and fused joints.
    NOTE 3    For dimensions larger than DN/OD 1200, or DN/ID 1200, this document can serve as general guidance regarding appearance, colour, physical and mechanical characteristics as well as performance requirements.
    Test methods are not included in this document.
