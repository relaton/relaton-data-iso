  content: Specification of minimum requirements for the installation, construction,
    function, documentation and testing of these systems to ensure patient safety.
    The requirements are included which relate to the source of supply, distribution
    system, terminal units, warning systems and non- interchangeability between key
    components and service outlets. The standard applies only for the medical gases
    oxygen, nitrous oxide, medical air, nitrogen, helium, carbon dioxide, specified
    mixtures of gases and medical vacuum. The annexes A to H contain recommendations
    for technological characteristics and system-related function.
