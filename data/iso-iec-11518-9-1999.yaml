  content: "This part of ISO/IEC 11518 specifies a physical level interface for transmitting
    digital data at 800 Mbit/s or 1 600 Mbit/s serially over fibre-optic cables across
    distances of up to 10 km. The signalling sequences and protocol used are compatible
    with HIPPI-PH, ISO/IEC 11518-1, which is limited to 25 m distances. HIPPI-Serial
    may be integrated as a host's native interface, or used as an external extender
    for HIPPI-PH ports\nSpecifications are included for:\n? the encoding and serialisation
    of the parallel data; \n? the sequence of signals required for link reset; \n?
    the timing and optical requirements of the serial signals; \n? 32-bit (800 Mbit/s,
    100 MByte/s) and 64-bit (1 600 Mbit/s, 200 MByte/s) operation;\n ? simplex and
    dual simplex operation."
