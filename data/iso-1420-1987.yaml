  content: For determining the degree of penetration by water test pieces cut from
    coated fabrics are subjet to known hydrostatic pressures. Tests may be conducted
    on the coated fabric as received or on test pieces which have been subjected to
    ageing or other tests. Time intervals between manufacturing and testing are given.
    Constitutes technical revision of the first edition (ISO 1420:1978)
