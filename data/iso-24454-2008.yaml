  content: ISO 24454:2008 identifies specific test procedures for the acquisition
    and presentation of comparable multi-point data for selected properties of rubber
    compounds. The data for each property are generated, using a single test method,
    as a function of important variables such as time, temperature and environmental
    effects. An important application consists in helping different suppliers produce
    material specification sheets in which the same set of properties is measured
    using the same conditions. Guidance on the interpretation of results is provided.
