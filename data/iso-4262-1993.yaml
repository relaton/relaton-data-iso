  content: The principle of the method specified is weighing a test portion into a
    glass coking bulb having a capillary opening and placing it in a metal furnace
    maintained at a temperature of approximately 550 °C, thus quickly heating the
    test portion to the point at which all volatile matter is evaporated out of the
    bulb, while the heavier residue remaining in the bulb undergoes cracking and coking
    reactions during a specified heating period, removing the bulb, cooling it in
    a desiccator and weighing again. The method may be used to determine amounts of
    carbon residues in the range of 0,01 % (m/m) to 30,0 % (m/m), left after evaporation
    and pyrolysis.
