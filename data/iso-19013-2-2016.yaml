abstract:
- content: ISO 19013-2:2016 specifies the requirements for rubber tubing and hoses
    used in gasoline fuel circuits for internal combustion engines. The gasoline fuels
    covered include those containing oxygenates such as methanol and fuels that have
    become oxidized ("sour gas"). In addition, this part of ISO 19013 can also be
    applied as a classification system to enable original equipment manufacturers
    (OEMs) to detail a "line call-out" of tests for specific applications where these
    are not covered by the main types specified (see example in Annex G). In this
    case, the hose or tubing would not carry any marking showing the number of ISO
    19013‑2:2016, but may detail the OEM's own identification markings as shown on
    their part drawings.
