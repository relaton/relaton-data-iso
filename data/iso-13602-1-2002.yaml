  content: "ISO 13602-1 provides methods to analyse, characterize and compare technical
    energy systems (TESs) with all their inputs, outputs and risk factors. It contains
    rules and guidelines for the methodology for such analyses. \nISO 13602-1 is intended
    to establish relations between inputs and outputs and thus to facilitate certification,
    marking and labelling."
