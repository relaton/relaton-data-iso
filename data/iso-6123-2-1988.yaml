abstract:
- content: Defines covered rollers as cylindrical cores, generally of metal, with
    a cover of rubber or plastics for particular use. Establishes a classification
    according to surface quality or imperfections and surface finish. A test method
    for the determination of surface roughness is also described. - Part 1 of this
    standard deals with the requirements for hardness, part 3 with dimensional tolerances.
    - Replaces the first edition by expanding to include an additional section (sub-clause
    4.3) and an annex giving the relationship betwen surface treatment and surface
    roughness.
