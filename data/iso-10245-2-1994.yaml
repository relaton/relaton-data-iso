- content: Specifies the requirements for devices which limit and/or indicate the
    loads, motions, performance and environment of mobile cranes. The general requirements
    for limiting and indicating devices for cranes are given in ISO 10245-1. Applies
    to all mobile cranes as defined in 4306-2. Some basic machine types within this
    scope are convertible for use in excavating work and other applications not considered
    to be lifting service. The requirements given here are applicable only to such
    machines when used as lifting cranes.
