    This document provides the test requirements of three typical separation test methods, which are the combined separation test, the horizontal separation test, the individual falling separation test, for the separation between the launch vehicle (LV) and the spacecraft (or between stages of a prototype LV model). It also provides the requirements for the separation test unit, test data, test timing and sequence, pre-test simulation, test environment, exception handling, test results assessment, test documentation, test facilities, test installation, preliminary adjustment of the test setup, measurement and data acquisition.
    This document is applicable to test providers and interested parties to implement the separation test between the launch vehicle and the spacecraft.
