    ISO 18437-2:2005 defines a resonance method for determining from laboratory measurements the dynamic mechanical properties of the resilient materials used in vibration isolators. It is applicable to shock and vibration systems operating from a fraction of a hertz to about 20 kHz.
    ISO 18437-2:2005 is applicable to resilient materials that are used in vibration isolators in order to reduce
    -- transmissions of unwanted vibrations from machines, structures or vehicles that radiate sound (fluid-borne, airborne, structure-borne, or other), and
    -- the transmission of low-frequency vibrations that act upon humans or cause damage to structures or sensitive equipment when the vibration is too severe.
    The data obtained with the measurement methods that are outlined in ISO 18437-2:2005 are used for
    -- the design of efficient vibration isolators,
    -- the selection of an optimum material for a given design,
    -- the theoretical computation of the transfer of vibrations through isolators,
    -- information during product development,
    -- product information provided by manufacturers and suppliers, and
    -- quality control.
