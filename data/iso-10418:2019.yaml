abstract:
- content: |-
    This document provides objectives, functional requirements and guidelines for techniques for the analysis and design of surface process safety systems for offshore installations used for the recovery of hydrocarbon resources.
    It also provides recommendations and requirements on support systems which complement the process safety systems in reducing risk.
    NOTE       These are not intended to be exhaustive.
    The scope of this document is limited to specifying the methods by which the asset is protected against loss of containment of hydrocarbon or other hazardous materials.
    This document is applicable to
    a)    fixed offshore structures, and
    b)    floating offshore production installations
    for the petroleum and natural gas industries.
    This document is not applicable to mobile offshore units and subsea installations.
    NOTE        Nevertheless, many of the principles contained in this document can be used as guidance.
