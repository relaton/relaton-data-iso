abstract:
- content: ISO 24453:2008 identifies specific test procedures for the acquisition
    and presentation of comparable single-point data for properties of rubber compounds.
    In general, each property is specified by a single test method and a single experimental
    value although, in certain cases, properties may be represented by more than one
    value obtained under different test conditions. The properties presented are those
    used to characterize processing properties, those most often quoted by manufacturers
    and in material specifications, and those relevant to more specific applications.
    An important application consists in helping different suppliers produce material
    specification sheets in which the same set of properties is measured using the
    same conditions.
