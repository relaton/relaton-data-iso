abstract:
- content: "ISO 16742:2014 sets out the basic methods for sampling fine iron ore of
    nominal top size <1 mm that is mixed with water to form a slurry. At very high
    ratios of fine solids to water when the material assumes a soft plastic form (about
    80 % solids depending on the particle size distribution of the solids), the mixture
    is correctly termed a paste. \nThe procedures described in ISO 16742:2014 apply
    to sampling of iron ore that is transported in moving streams as a slurry. These
    streams can fall freely or be confined in pipes, launders, chutes, spirals, or
    similar channels. "
