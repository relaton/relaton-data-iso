    This document gives guidelines for establishing interoperability among independently functioning product identification and related authentication systems, as described in ISO 16678. The permanent transfer of data from one system to another is out of the scope of this document.
    It also gives guidance on how to specify an environment open to existing or new methods of identification and authentication of objects, and which is accessible for legacy systems that may need to remain active.
    It is applicable to any industry, stakeholder or user group requiring object identification and authentication systems. It can be used on a global scale, or in limited environments. This document supports those involved in planning and establishing interoperation.
