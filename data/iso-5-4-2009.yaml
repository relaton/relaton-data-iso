abstract:
- content: "ISO 5-4:2009 specifies the geometric conditions for the definition of
    ISO 5 standard reflection density. It also recommends tolerances on geometric
    conditions that can be used in the design of instruments. The spectral conditions
    are specified in ISO 5-3.\nISO 5-4:2009 also specifies the requirements for polarization
    (if that feature is included) and for backing material, and makes recommendations
    regarding accuracy and linearity. \nAlthough intended primarily for use in the
    measurement of the reflection characteristics of photographic and graphic arts
    materials, ISO 5-4:2009 is also applicable to the measurement of these characteristics
    for other materials."
