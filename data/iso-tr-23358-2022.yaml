- content: |-
    This document reposts a case study on how to establish and maintain standardized cardiac examination export measurement data (CE-EMD), especially for enabling its secondary use for medical research. The document includes information for CE-EMD on:
    —    Building a representative coalition of stakeholders to identify and establish specifications;
    —    Standardizing both the content and format in reports;
    —    Maintaining and extending the specifications over time.
    Out-of-scope for this document are any requirements for specific CE-EMD content or formatting. Also, this document is limited to cardiac examination reporting, and does not encompass other clinical care areas or reporting that have been standardized.
