    This document is applicable to the minimum requirements for steel sheet used in the manufacture of corrugated steel pipe, in coils, flat cut lengths and corrugated cut lengths metallic-coated by the continuous hot-dip process.
    This product is intended for storm sewers, culverts, drains and similar uses.
    Several metallic-coated materials are covered, which relies on users to determine which product best serves their needs. Four different metallic coatings are included:
    —          zinc coated;
    —          zinc-5 % aluminium-mischmetal alloy coated;
    —          55 % aluminium-zinc alloy coated;
    —          aluminium-silicon alloy coated.
