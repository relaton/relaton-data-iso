    This document describes the experimental framework, results, and conclusions from a round robin test that was performed in order to establish correlations between accelerated weathering according to the ISO 18930 test method and outdoor weathering at nine outdoor sites.
    The types of digital printing technology that were used in this round robin test are aqueous inkjet, solvent inkjet, UV curable inkjet, digitally-exposed silver halide, and thermal mass transfer. The image print stability data and correlations of this document are to be considered illustrative of the performance of these classes of materials. Extension of these correlations to other classes of materials, such as dye sublimation, is verified by appropriate experimentation.
