  content: Gives two methods for the determination of boron in photographic processing
    wastes. The first method is the estimation of borates by titration of the boric
    acid-mannitol complex. Suitable for boron concentrations of 0,1 mg/l and higher.
    The second alternative method is a spectrophotometric technique using methylene
    blue which can be used in the concentration range of 0,1 mg/l to 1,0 mg/l.
