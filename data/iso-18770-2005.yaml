  content: "ISO 18770:2005 specifies the measures to be taken to reduce fires originating
    from machinery-space flammable oil systems and to prevent leakage of flammable
    oil. It is intended for designers, shipyard personnel, engine-room personnel,
    owners, operators and maintenance personnel. Requirements contained herein address
    the design, construction, testing, installation, maintenance and inspection of
    systems containing flammable oil. \nISO 18770:2005 is applicable to new and existing
    vessels, and is intended to be used as a supplement to the regulations for fuel
    oil, lubricating oil and other flammable oils contained in the International Convention
    for the Safety of Life At Sea (SOLAS 74), as amended, issued by the International
    Maritime Organization (IMO)."
