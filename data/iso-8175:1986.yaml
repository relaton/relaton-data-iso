  content: A liquid sample obtained at low temperature is vaporized and then passed
    through a chromatographic column which permits the separation of the oligomers.
    The detection is performed by flame ionization an the peaks obtained are compared
    with those derived from an external standard. The method is applicable to propylene
    having propene dimers (hexenes) contents greater than 20mg/kg and propene trimers
    (nonenes) contents greater than 30 mg/kg.
