abstract:
- content: "This document specifies the safety requirements and measures for \n— surface
    planing machines, also called jointers,\n— thickness planing machines, also called
    planers or single surface planers,\n— combined surface/thickness planing machines\nwith
    fixed cutter block position, with an integrated feed in thickness planing mode,
    with or without demountable power feed device in planing mode, with manual loading
    and/or unloading of the workpiece and capable of continuous production use, hereinafter
    referred to also as “machines”. \nThe machines are designed to cut solid wood
    and material with similar physical characteristics to wood.\nIt deals with all
    significant hazards, hazardous situations and events as listed in Annex A relevant
    to the machines when operated, adjusted and maintained as intended and under the
    conditions foreseen by the manufacturer; reasonably foreseeable misuse has been
    considered too. Transport, assembly, dismantling, disabling and scrapping phases
    have also been taken into account.\nIt is also applicable to surface planing machines
    and combined surface/thickness planing machines fitted with an optional mortising
    device, whose hazards have been dealt with.\nThis document does not apply to:\na)
    machines with more than one cutter block;\nb) machines with a mortising unit driven
    by a separate motor;\nc) machines where the cutter block is adjustable for depth
    of cut setting in thickness planing mode;\nd) machines where the conversion from
    planing to thickness planing mode or vice versa is achieved by mounting or demounting
    parts/units;\ne) machines where surface planing and thickness planing can be performed
    on the same section of the cutter block at the same time;\nf) machines intended
    for use in potentially explosive atmosphere;\ng) machines manufactured prior to
    the date of its publication as an international standard."
