abstract:
- content: "This document describes the method of determining the etch pit density,
    which is used to detect the dislocations and processing-introduced defects that
    occur on single-crystal GaN substrates or single-crystal GaN films. \nIt is applicable
    to the defects specified in AWI 5618-1 from among the defects cropped out on the
    surface of the following types of GaN substrates or films: single-crystal GaN
    substrate; single-crystal GaN film formed by homoepitaxial growth on a single-crystal
    GaN substrate; or single-crystal GaN film formed by heteroepitaxial growth on
    a single-crystal Al2O3, SiC, or Si substrate.\n\nIt is applicable to defects with
    an etch pit density of 7 × 107 cm-2 or lower."
