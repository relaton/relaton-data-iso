    ISO/IEC TR 20004:2015 refines the AVA_VAN assurance family activities defined in ISO/IEC 18045 and provides more specific guidance on the identification, selection and assessment of relevant potential vulnerabilities in order to conduct an ISO/IEC 15408 evaluation of a software target of evaluation. This Technical Report leverages publicly available information security resources to support the method of scoping and implementing ISO/IEC 18045 vulnerability analysis activities. The Technical Report currently uses the common weakness enumeration (CWE) and the common attack pattern enumeration and classification (CAPEC), but does not preclude the use of any other appropriate resources. Furthermore, this Technical Report is not meant to address all possible vulnerability analysis methods, including those that fall outside the scope of the activities outlined in ISO/IEC 18045.
    ISO/IEC TR 20004:2015 does not define evaluator actions for certain high assurance ISO/IEC 15408 components, where there is as yet no generally agreed guidance.
