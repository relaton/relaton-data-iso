    ISO 7599:2010 lays down a method for specifying decorative and protective anodic oxidation coatings on aluminium (including aluminium-based alloys). It defines the characteristic properties of anodic oxidation coatings, lists methods of test for checking the characteristic properties, provides minimum performance requirements, and gives information on the grades of aluminium suitable for anodizing and the importance of pretreatment to ensure the required appearance or texture of the finished work.
    It is not applicable to non-porous oxidation coatings of the barrier layer type, oxidation coatings produced by chromic acid or phosphoric acid anodizing, oxidation coatings intended merely to prepare the substrate for subsequent application of organic coatings or electrodeposition of metals, or hard anodic oxidation coatings used mainly for engineering purposes, for which abrasion and wear resistance are the primary characteristics (see ISO 10074).
