    The models defined in ISO/IEC 9594-2:2008 provide a conceptual and terminological framework for the other parts of ISO/IEC 9594, which define various aspects of the Directory.
    The functional and administrative authority models define ways in which the Directory can be distributed, both functionally and administratively. Generic DSA and DSA information models and an Operational Framework are also provided to support Directory distribution.
    The generic Directory Information Models describe the logical structure of the DIB from the perspective of Directory and Administrative Users. In these models, the fact that the Directory is distributed, rather than centralized, is not visible.
    ISO/IEC 9594-2:2008 provides a specialization of the generic Directory Information Models to support Directory Schema administration.
    Other parts of ISO/IEC 9594 make use of the concepts defined in ISO/IEC 9594-2:2008 to define specializations of the generic information and DSA models to provide specific information, DSA and operational models supporting particular directory capabilities (e.g. Replication):
    The security model establishes a framework for the specification of access control mechanisms. It provides a mechanism for identifying the access control scheme in effect in a particular portion of the DIT, and it defines three flexible, specific access control schemes which are suitable for a wide variety of applications and styles of use. The security model also provides a framework for protecting the confidentiality and integrity of directory operations using mechanisms such as encryption and digital signatures. This makes use of the framework for authentication defined in ISO/IEC 9594-8 as well as generic upper layers security tools defined in ISO/IEC 11586-1.
    DSA models establish a framework for the specification of the operation of the components of the Directory.
