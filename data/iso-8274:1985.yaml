    leaves in the normal operating condition for which they are designed and installed.
    The test may be carried out on doorsets installed in a finished building or in
    a laboratory test rig. The horizontal force required for closing is used as a
    parameter for quanifying the operating performance. For terms and definitions
    see 1804. The test procedure is illustrated in a figure.
