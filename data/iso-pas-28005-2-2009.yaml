abstract:
- content: "ISO/PAS 28005-2:2009 contains technical specifications that facilitate
    efficient exchange of electronic information between ships and shore for coastal
    transit or port calls. It is intended to cover safety and security information
    requirements related mainly to the relationships between the ship and the port
    and coastal state authorities as defined below.\nISO/PAS 28005-2:2009 contains
    the definition of core data elements for use in electronic port clearance (EPC)
    messages. It contains definitions of core data elements for electronic messaging
    between ships and shore in the areas of safety, security and marine operations.
    It does not define any structuring of messages or provide any guidance on what
    information is required for a particular purpose; it is rather a general data
    dictionary for safety, security or operation-related maritime information.\nIt
    is intended for use in XML messages and will for that reason differ somewhat from
    the similar trade data elements directory (TDED) International Standard (ISO 7372).
    \nThe core data elements defined in ISO/PAS 28005-2:2009 are specified so that
    their meaning and interpretation in general shall be independent of the context
    they are used in.\nISO/PAS 28005-2:2009 does not define the message formats required
    to exchange information.\nISO/PAS 28005-2:2009 contains definitions of core data
    elements for electronic port clearance. These elements cover all requirements
    for ship-to-shore and shore-to-ship reporting as defined in the following.\nISO/PAS
    28005-2:2009 can also be used for information exchanges between the ship and the
    ship agent, the port as well as ship operator or manager. It will not necessarily
    cover issues such as customs clearance of imported or exported goods or transport
    service provisions to goods owners."
