abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 29341-1-1:2011(E) The UPnP Device Architecture (formerly known
    as the DCP Framework). It defines the protocols for communication between controllers,
    or control points, and devices. For discovery, description, control, eventing,
    and presentation, the UPnP Device Architecture uses the following protocol stack:
    \  \n- UPnP vendor-specific information;                         \n- information
    defined by UPnP;                              \n- UPnPspecific protocols such
    as the Simple Service Discovery Protocol (SSDP) the General Event Notification
    Architecture (GENA) and the multicast event protocol defined in this document,
    and others that are referenced. SSDP is delivered via either multicast or unicast
    UDP. Multicast events are delivered via multicast UDP. GENA is delivered via HTTP.
    Ultimately, all messages above are delivered over IP. The remaining clauses of
    this document describe the content and format for each of these protocol layers
    in detail."
