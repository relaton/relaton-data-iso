    This document describes a basic role and functional model of digital infrastructure service for urban intelligent transport system (ITS) service applications. It provides an extension of the information given in ISO/TR 4445. It lays out a paradigm describing:
    a) a framework for the provision of digital infrastructure for cooperative ITS service application;
    b) a description of the concept of roles and functional models for such services;
    c) a conceptual architecture between actors involved in the provision/receipt of digital infrastructure services;
    d) references for the key documents on which the architecture is based; and
    e) a taxonomy of the organization of generic procedures.
