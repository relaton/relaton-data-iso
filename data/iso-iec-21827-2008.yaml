  content: "ISO/IEC 21827:2008 specifies the Systems Security Engineering - Capability
    Maturity Model® (SSE-CMM®), which describes the essential characteristics of an
    organization's security engineering process that must exist to ensure good security
    engineering. ISO/IEC 21827:2008 does not prescribe a particular process or sequence,
    but captures practices generally observed in industry. The model is a standard
    metric for security engineering practices covering the following: \n- the entire
    life cycle, including development, operation, maintenance and decommissioning
    activities;\n- the whole organization, including management, organizational and
    engineering activities;\n- concurrent interactions with other disciplines, such
    as system, software, hardware, human factors and test engineering; system management,
    operation and maintenance;\n- interactions with other organizations, including
    acquisition, system management, certification, accreditation and evaluation.\nThe
    objective is to facilitate an increase of maturity of the security engineering
    processes within the organization. The SSE-CMM® is related to other CMMs which
    focus on different engineering disciplines and topic areas and can be used in
    combination or conjunction with them."
