abstract:
- content: "This document provides guidance for ancillary material (AM) users. It
    is applicable to cellular therapeutic products, including those gene therapy products
    whereby cells form part of the final product. It does not apply to products without
    cells.\nThis document focuses primarily on ancillary materials (AMs) of biological
    (human and animal) origin and their potential impurities and contaminants. \nNOTE
    1    The decision chart in Figure 1 illustrates the rationale underlying the scope
    of this document.\nHowever, diverse biological sources, including plants, insects
    and marine organisms, can also be used in the development of a cellular therapeutic
    product. Therefore the fundamental principles of risk management also apply for
    these sources of AMs.\nThis document does not cover the selection, assessment
    or control of starting materials and excipients. However, it is anticipated that
    these are still covered by general risk management procedures.\nThis document
    is applicable for users at all stages of clinical development and supply; however
    maximum benefits can be gained by the implementation of the recommendations in
    the early stages of development.\nNOTE 2    International, regional or national
    regulations or requirements can also apply to specific topics covered in this
    document."
