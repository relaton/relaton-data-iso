abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 13250:2003 (2nd edition) specifies two syntaxes for the interchange
    of Topic Maps. One of these syntaxes is based on the ISO/IEC 10744:1997 (HyTime)
    meta-DTD (meta Document Type Definition), and it is itself specified as a meta-DTD.
    The other, called XTM (XML Topic Maps), is specified as an eXtensible Markup Language
    (XML) DTD.\nBoth syntaxes allow the expression of: \n-  associations between subjects
    of discourse and zero or more of their names, to be used in various contexts,\n-
    \ associations between subjects and occurrences (pieces of relevant addressable
    information),\n-  user-defined associations among any arbitrary subjects of discourse,\n-
    \ user-defined subjects which are classes of subjects, including classes of associations
    and the distinct roles that are played in instances of associations, and\n-  scopes,
    expressed as sets of subjects, within the context of which specific associations
    are meant to be understood as valid and/or relevant."
