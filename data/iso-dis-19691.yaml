abstract:
- content: "This international standard specifies a method for measuring the corrosion
    loss of each part of \nstructures using unpainted steel such as weathering steel
    by using the attached coupons\nAlso this standard provides a prediction method
    for corrosion loss over a long period from the \nmeasurement results and a method
    for determining the applicability of existing and new \nconstructing weathering
    steel structures.\nAlso this standard provides a method for evaluating the type
    of corrosion by visual inspection of \nthe appearance of rust on an existing weathering
    steel structure."
