    ISO/TS 13399-60:2007 specifies a reference dictionary for connection systems for cutting tools, together with their descriptive properties and domains of values. The reference dictionary contains definitions and identifications of the classes of connection systems for cutting tools, with an associated classification scheme, definitions and identifications of the data element types that represent the properties of connection systems for cutting tools, and definitions and identifications of domains of values for describing the above data element types.
    The following is within the scope of ISO/TS 13399-60:2007: standard data that represent the various classes of connection systems for cutting tools; standard data that represent the various properties connection systems for cutting tools; standard data that represent domains of values used for properties of connection systems for cutting tools; a single implementation method by which the standard data defined in ISO/TS 13399-60:2007 can be exchanged (see ISO 10303-21).
    The following is not within its scope: specialized or expert knowledge on the design and use of cutting tools; rules used to determine the information that should be communicated; applications where these standard data may be stored or referenced; implementation methods other that the one defined in ISO/TS 13399-60:2007 by which the standard data can be exchanged and referenced; information models for cutting tools; definitions of classes and properties for cutting items, tool items, assembly items, adaptive items, or for reference systems and common concepts, these being covered by other parts of ISO 13399.
