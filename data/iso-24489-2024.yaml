abstract:
- content: |-
    This document describes the testing methodology based on acoustic emission (AE) for atmospheric and low-pressure (less than or equal to 50 kPa on top of the tank) metallic storage tank floors and the classification system to be used for test results.
    This document applies to acoustic emission testing (AT) for corrosion severity of atmospheric metal storage tank floors.
    The technique is limited to tank floors made of construction steel and relies on an active corrosion process. It applies only in cases where corrosion of the floor is the governing damage mechanism. Good results will be obtained providing corrosion conditions have not changed.
