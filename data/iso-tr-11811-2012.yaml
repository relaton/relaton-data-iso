abstract:
- content: ISO/TR 11811:2012 establishes techniques for the evaluation of tribological
    performance of sliding contacts with a lateral size of between a few nanometres
    and 10 µm, and where the applied load is between 50 µN and 100 mN. It describes
    procedures for undertaking these measurements, and provides guidance on the effect
    of parameters on test results. It does not cover existing SPM techniques, such
    as frictional force microscopy and atomic force microscopy (AFM).
