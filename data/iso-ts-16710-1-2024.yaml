    This document describes the “Feedback Method”, a method designed specifically to collect the contribution of machinery end-users by reconstructing and understanding how work is actually performed (i.e. the real work). This method can help to improve technical standards, as well as the design, manufacturing, and use of machinery.
    By collecting the experiences of skilled users, this method can be used to reconstruct their actual work activities under different operating conditions and with any kind of machine. This helps to identify all the critical aspects having an impact on health and safety, or associated with ergonomic principles. Moreover, it makes it possible to identify some basic elements for defining the standards for machines and for their revision and improvement. It can also improve production efficiency and identify any need for additional study and research.
    The method is designed to minimize the influence of the subjectivity of the facilitators and researchers in reconstructing and describing the reality of work, and to maximize the “objective” contribution of the skilled users of the machine.
    The method combines a high level of reproducibility, sensitivity, and user-friendliness with low demands in term of resources, which makes it attractive to micro, small and medium-sized enterprises.
    This document is addressed to standards writers, designers and manufacturers, employers-buyers, end users, craftsmen and workers, market surveillance and authorities.
