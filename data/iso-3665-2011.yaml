    ISO 3665:2011 establishes a system for the classification of intra-oral radiographic film by the speed of the film/process system and by the size of the film. It specifies the sensitometric characteristics of the film/process systems, the physical characteristics of the film and packets, and it describes packaging and labelling requirements.
    ISO 3665:2011 is applicable to intra-oral dental radiographic film for manual or automatic processing. It does not apply to films intended to be exposed with fluorescent intensifying screens, or films intended to be viewed primarily by reflected light.
