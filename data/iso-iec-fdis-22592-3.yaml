    This document specifies test methods as well as test charts to measure the physical durability attributes in duplex colour prints typically used in office environment. This document is applicable t This document specifies test methods as well as test charts to measure the physical durability attributes in duplex colour prints typically used in office environment. This document is applicable to duplex prints comprising several sheets which are printed colour images on both surfaces of a substrate. Included are digital prints formed by using a multifunction or single function printer.
    This document is applicable to evaluate durability of colour prints under the environment and stress assuming general office use case including transportation from the place printed to practically used, so permanence and durability in archival and storage environments are out of scope of this document.
    The physical durability attributes included are thermal and humidity blocking, water resistance, abrasion resistance, and scratch resistance.
    Arranging measurement settings appropriately, all the attributes are also applicable for a simplex print set comprising several sheets which are printed colour images on one surface of a substrate and no image on the other surface. o duplex prints comprising several sheets which are printed colour images on both surfaces of a substrate.
