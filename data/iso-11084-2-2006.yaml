    ISO 11084-2:2006 specifies the shapes, dimensions and positions for the pins and holes of a register system used to achieve accurate image positioning on a printing forme during the plate-making operations undertaken during the printing forme preparation process. It is also applicable to plate-bending equipment and transfer systems required to convert between register pin systems.
    ISO 11084-2:2006 is applicable to prepress pin registering system for plate making using printing formes equal to or larger than 420 mm by 594 mm (A2). It is applicable by analogy to the pin register systems of printing presses.
