    This document gives guidelines on assistive technologies and functionalities that need to be included in accessible virtual keyboards. This document underlines which kind of interaction modes can be embedded, which kinds of Assistive Technologies can be easily bound to virtual keyboards, and which kinds of functionalities have to be taken into account within virtual keyboards.
    This international standard does not apply to physical keyboards that use real material keys or adaptable keys, which can be customized to user needs, for example with LCD display.
