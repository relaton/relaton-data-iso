    ISO/TS 14907-2:2011 describes tests that verify on-board unit (OBU) conformance of implementations of functions and data structures, as defined in the implementation conformance statement based on ISO 14906:2011, for electronic fee collection (EFC) applications. After the tests of isolated data items and functions, an example is given for testing of a complete EFC transaction.
    ISO/TS 14907-2:2011 comprises definitions of OBU conformance assessment tests of
    - basic dedicated short-range communication (DSRC) L7 functionality,
    - EFC application functions,
    - EFC attributes (i.e. EFC application information),
    - the addressing procedures of EFC attributes and (hardware) components [e.g. integrated circuit cards (ICC) and man-machine interfaces (MMI)],
    - the EFC transaction model, which defines the common elements and steps of any EFC transaction, and
    - the behaviour of the interface so as to support interoperability on an EFC-DSRC application interface level.
    It also defines tests that
    - assess OBU capabilities,
    - assess OBU behaviour,
    - serve as a guide for OBU conformance evaluation and type approval,
    - achieve comparability between the results of the corresponding tests applied in different places at different times, and
    - facilitate communications between parties.
    It is outside the scope of ISO/TS 14907-2:2011 to define tests that assess
    - performance,
    - robustness, and
    - reliability of an implementation.
