- content: |-
    ISO/TR 20545:2017 provides the results of consideration on potential areas and items of standardization for automated driving systems. In this document, automated driving systems are defined as systems that control longitudinal and lateral motions of the vehicle at the same time.
    Potential standardization areas and items are widely extracted and marshalled in a systematic manner to distinguish potential standardization for various automated vehicle systems. When, what, and by whom the standardization activities are actually done are discussed separately.
