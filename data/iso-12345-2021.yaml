    This document specifies cleanliness assessment procedures for evaluating the amount of debris found within the clean side of diesel fuel injection assemblies, which could lead to a reduction in the system’s operational effectiveness.
    While other International Standards, e.g. ISO 16232, relate to cleanliness of components used in road vehicle fluid circuits, this document is focused on diesel fuel injection assemblies as supplied to diesel engine manufacturers or the service market.
