    This document provides guidance on reducing the energy consumed by transportation for passengers, delivery items, freight and postal item services in cities and city zones.
    This document does not designate specific procedures to save energy but suggests energy-saving options to be adopted in transportation systems normally organized in different locations, on different scales and for different purposes.
    NOTE   Some typical energy-saving options are listed in 6.2.2.
