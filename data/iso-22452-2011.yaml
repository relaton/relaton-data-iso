    ISO 22452:2011 specifies test methods for determining the structural properties of double-sided, wood-based, load-bearing structural insulated panels (SIPs) for use in walls.
    It is applicable to SIPs having two face layers, at least one of which is a wood-based structural panel, and a core made of a thermally insulating material with sufficient shear strength to cause the face layers to act together structurally.
