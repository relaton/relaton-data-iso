abstract:
- content: "ISO/TS 17090-1 defines the basic concepts of a healthcare public key infrastructure
    (PKI) and provides a scheme of interoperability requirements to establish a PKI
    enabled secure communication of health information. It also identifies the major
    stakeholders who are communicating in health, as well as the main security services
    required for health communication where PKI may be required. \nISO/TS 17090-1
    gives a brief introduction to public key cryptography and the basic components
    of a healthcare PKI. It further introduces different types of certificates, public
    key identity certificates and associated attribute certificates, for relying parties,
    self-signed certification authority (CA) certificates, and CA hierarchies and
    bridging structures."
