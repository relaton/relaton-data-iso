abstract:
- content: |-
    ISO 15012-1:2004 deals with the significant hazards caused by the emission of welding fume particles from welding fume separation equipment operated according to its intended use and under the conditions foreseen by the manufacturer.
    ISO 15012-1:2004 specifies safety requirements concerning the separation of welding fumes and describes a method for determining the particle separation efficiency of welding fume separation equipment.
    ISO 15012-1:2004 does not deal with:
    hazards caused by gases emitted by welding, cutting and allied processes or by the welding fume separation equipment itself; hazards caused by the noise and vibrations of the welding fume separation equipment; other fundamental aspects of safety technology, such as electrical, mechanical and pneumatical safety, maintenance, etc.
