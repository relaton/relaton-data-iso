abstract:
- content: 'ISO 4999:2014 is applicable to cold-reduced carbon steel sheet of commercial,
    drawing, and structural qualities coated by a continuous hot-dip terne (lead alloy)
    coating process. It includes the group of products commonly known as terne plate
    or terne sheets (or, in the USA, as terne coated). Terne sheets are used where
    ease of solderability, a degree of corrosion resistance, or amenability to stamping,
    pressing, or deep drawing would be advantageous. Terne (lead alloy) coated steel
    sheet can be ordered in one of two ordering conditions: condition A, steel ordered
    to satisfy mechanical property requirements, and condition B, steel ordered to
    make an identified part.'
