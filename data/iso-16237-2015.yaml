    ISO 16237:2015 specifies the geometry of the test specimens and the method for the cross-tension testing of single mechanical joints on single-lap test specimens up to a single sheet thickness of 4,5 mm.
    The term "sheet", as used in this International Standard, includes extrusions and cast materials.
    The purpose of the cross-tension test is to determine the mechanical characteristics and the failure types of the joints made with different joining methods.
    ISO 16237:2015 does not apply to civil engineering applications such as metal building and steel construction which are covered by other applicable standards.
