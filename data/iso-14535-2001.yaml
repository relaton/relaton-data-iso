    This International Standard applies to room-light loading packages either containing photographic film or paper rolls
    for electronic scanners or image-setting devices. It specifies the dimensions of the package and its contents, critical
    equipment interfacing features, and package marking. The prime aim of this International Standard is to ensure
    compatibility between room-light loading packages and the equipment in which it is used.
    Two types of package are recognized. One type uses a rigid flange into which mandrils on the exposing device are
    inserted. The other type uses a flexible flange and relies on the exposing equipment design to hold the roll correctly
    in the machine.
