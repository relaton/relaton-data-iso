  content: Gives management guidelines for implementing continuous quality improvement
    within an organization. The ways of adopting and implementing these guidelines
    depend upon factors such as the culture, size, nature of the organization, the
    types of products or services offered, and the markets and customer needs served.
    Therefore, an organization should develop an improvement process suited to its
    own needs and resources.
