abstract:
- content: ISO/TR 12748:2015 describes production flow measurement of wet natural
    gas streams with WGFMs in surface and subsea facilities. Wet natural gas streams
    are gas-dominated flows with liquids like water and/or hydrocarbon liquids. ISO/TR
    12748:2015 defines terms/symbols, explains the various concepts, and describes
    best practices of wet gas flow meter design and operation. It addresses metering
    techniques, testing, installation, commissioning, and operation practices such
    as maintenance, calibration, and verification. It also provides a theoretical
    background of this comprehensive, challenging and still evolving measurement technology.
