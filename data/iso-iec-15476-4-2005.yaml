    ISO/IEC 15476-4:2005 explains the Data models subject area. The CDIF semantic metamodel is used to ensure that the information held by tools communicating using CDIF is transferred with an agreed meaning. It covers the information required to express Entity-Relationship-Attribute Modelling and Logical Database Design concepts.
    ISO/IEC 15476-4:2005 is intended to be used by anyone wishing to understand and/or use CDIF. It provides a definition of a single subject area of the CDIF semantic metamodel. It is suitable for:
    - Those evaluating CDIF,
    - Those who wish to understand the principles and concepts of a CDIF transfer, and
    - Those developing importers and exporters.
