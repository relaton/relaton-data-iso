abstract:
- content: ISO 18580:2015 specifies the verification method of total running resistance
    force when the exhaust gas emissions and/or fuel consumption of motorcycles are
    measured during mode running on a chassis dynamometer. The performance of chassis
    dynamometer is verified by comparing the measured total running resistance force
    (measured by a chassis dynamometer absorption force) and the target total running
    resistance force (calculated from velocity, acceleration and/or deceleration).
    This International Standard is applicable when the running resistance force of
    a chassis dynamometer is set in accordance with ISO 11486.
