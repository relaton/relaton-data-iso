  content: "This standard defines requirements and guidelines to help organisations
    understanding and mainstreaming biodiversity’s protection, conservation, the sustainable
    use of its components and the fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising
    out of the utilization of genetic resources, within their activities. \n\nThis
    standard is suitable for all kind of organisations (e.g. economic operators, national
    or local governments, inter-governmental organizations, public or private organizations,
    financial institutions, development organizations, civil society organizations
    and specialists) and can be used at different scales if needed (e.g. local scales
    such as a production site or municipalities, as well as a larger scales such as
    a corporate / entire group level or by a regional public organisations). This
    standard is applicable to all activities of any organisations (including projects
    and operations), from site direct operations (including land-holding) to entire
    value chains or their sphere of influence (including relationship inside or outside
    the value chain, e.g: formal or information associations in which the organisation
    is involved, peer organisations, competitors …).\n\nWhile this standard is aligned
    with current regulations and standards, it can be used as a standalone by organisations
    and without prior knowledge, actions or strategies of biodiversity. \n\nThis standard
    ensures robustness of organisations’ strategic approaches to biodiversity in terms
    of the method used to define it, its content, and its implementation. It is built
    on latest available data and knowledge and sets best practices for organisations.
    \n\nThis standard provides guidance on identifying organisation-specific dependencies
    and impacts on biodiversity, prioritizing them, setting ambitions and goals, and
    defining coherent actions to mitigate impacts on biodiversity. It also sets requirements
    regarding governance of the strategic approach for biodiversity, engagement of
    stakeholders, and communication."
