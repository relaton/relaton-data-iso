  content: "ISO 18322:2017 specifies requirements for when a space test centre needs
    to demonstrate its competence to consistently provide space testing that meets
    customer requirements. \nIt specifies requirements for space test centres, applicable
    to the test process, test personnel (both, of the customer and the space test
    centre), test facilities, test environment and any operations related to the test
    item under responsibility of the space test centre as requested by the customer.\nISO
    18322:2017 also defines the requirements for space testing and the development
    of test facilities.\nISO 18322:2017 was originally prepared with a focus on environmental
    testing (i.e. thermal vacuum, vibrations, acoustic, Electromagnetic Compatibility
    (EMC), Radio Frequency (RF), physical properties measurements, etc.).\nISO 18322:2017
    applies to space test centres as self-standing organizations, or those belonging
    to a parent organization. ISO 18322:2017 has been prepared for organizations providing
    test services for space and launch segment elements and subsystems."
