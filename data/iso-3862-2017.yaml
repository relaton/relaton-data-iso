    ISO 3862:2017 specifies requirements for five types of spiral-wire-reinforced hydraulic hose and hose assembly of nominal size from 6,3 to 51.
    They are suitable for use with:
    -      oil-based hydraulic fluids HH, HL, HM, HR and HV as defined in ISO 6743‑4 at temperatures ranging from −40 °C to +100 °C;
    -      water-based fluids HFC, HFAE, HFAS and HFB as defined in ISO 6743‑4 at temperatures ranging from 0 °C to +60 °C;
    -      water at temperatures ranging from 0 °C to +60 °C.
    This document does not include requirements for end fittings. It is limited to requirements for hoses and hose assemblies.
    NOTE          It is the responsibility of the user, in consultation with the hose manufacturer, to establish the compatibility of the hose with the fluid to be used.
