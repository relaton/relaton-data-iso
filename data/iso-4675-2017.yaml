    ISO 4675:2017 specifies a method for determining the ability of fabrics coated with rubber or plastics to resist the effect of low temperature when subjected to bending at specified temperatures after definite periods of exposure. This method is applicable to material with a thickness within the range 0,1 mm to 2,2 mm. For materials of greater thickness than this, modifications to the standard equipment apply (see 9.2, third paragraph).
    Because fabrics coated with rubber or plastics are used in different applications requiring low temperature flexing, no general relationship between this test and service performance can be given or implied.
