  content: "The provisions of this document apply to Single-Stage and economised refrigerant
    compressors of the positive displacement type. Selected test methods are described
    for the determination of the refrigerating capacity, the power, the isentropic
    efficiency and the coefficient of performance. These test methods provide results
    of sufficient accuracy to permit consideration of the suitability of a refrigerant
    compressor to operate satisfactorily under any set of basic test conditions required
    for a given refrigeration installation.\nAttention is drawn in particular to a
    number of special precautions necessary to reduce testing losses to a minimum.
    \nThis document applies only to tests carried out at the manufacturer’s works,
    or wherever the necessary equipment for testing to the accuracy required can be
    made available. The accuracy of measurement are specified in Clause 4.\nNOTE -
    Tests on complete refrigeration installations are dealt with in ISO 916.\nAnnexes
    B and C, which provide additional information, do not form integral parts of this
    document."
