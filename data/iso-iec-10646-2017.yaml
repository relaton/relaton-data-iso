  content: "ISO/IEC 10646:2017 specifies the Universal Coded Character Set (UCS).
    It is applicable to the represen-tation, transmission, interchange, processing,
    storage, input, and presentation of the written form of the lan-guages of the
    world as well as of additional symbols.\n-           specifies the architecture
    of this International Standard,\n-           defines terms used in this International
    Standard,\n-           describes the general structure of the UCS codespace,\n-
    \          specifies the Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP) of the UCS,\n-           specifies
    supplementary planes of the UCS: the Supplementary Multilingual Plane (SMP), the
    Supplemen-tary Ideographic Plane (SIP), the Tertiary Ideographic Plane (TIP),
    and the Supplementary Special-purpose Plane (SSP),\n-           defines a set
    of graphic characters used in scripts and the written form of languages on a world-wide
    scale,\n-           specifies the names for the graphic characters and format
    characters of the BMP, SMP, SIP, TIP, SSP and their coded representations within
    the UCS codespace,\n-           specifies the coded representations for control
    characters and private use characters,\n-           specifies three encoding forms
    of the UCS: UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32,\n-           specifies seven encoding schemes
    of the UCS: UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-16BE, UTF-16LE, UTF-32, UTF-32BE, and UTF-32LE,\n-
    \          specifies the management of future additions to this coded character
    set.\nThe UCS is an encoding system different from that specified in ISO/IEC 2022.
    The method to designate UCS from ISO/IEC 2022 is specified in 12.2. \nA graphic
    character will be assigned only one code point in the standard, located either
    in the BMP or in one of the supplementary planes."
