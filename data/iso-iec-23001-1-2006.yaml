  content: "ISO/IEC 23001-1:2006 provides a standardized set of generic technologies
    for encoding XML documents. It addresses a broad spectrum of applications and
    requirements by providing generic methods for transmitting and compressing XML
    documents. \nISO/IEC 23001-1:2006 provides a specification which gives rules for
    the preparation of XML documents for efficient transport and storage, and enables
    the development of ISO/IEC 23001-1 terminals to receive, decode and assemble possibly
    partitioned and compressed XML documents. \nThe binary MPEG format for XML relies
    on schema knowledge between encoder and decoder in order to reach high compression
    efficiency, while providing fragmentation mechanisms for ensuring transmission
    and processing flexibility. ISO/IEC 23001-1:2006 also defines means to compile
    and transmit schema knowledge information to enable the decoding of compressed
    XML documents without a priori schema knowledge at the receiving terminal. \nThe
    binary MPEG format for XML is described in four main sections:\n- System Architecture
    presents the architecture of an ISO/IEC 23001-1-compliant terminal and general
    characteristics of an ISO/IEC 23001-1 decoder, such as decoder behaviour. \n-
    Binary Format specifies binary syntax and associated semantics of the structural
    elements. In particular, this section describes the structure of a binary access
    unit.\n- Binary Fragment Update Payload specifies binary syntax and associated
    semantics of the payload content. In particular, this section describes the decoding
    process of complex Type content using finite state automaton decoders. \n- Advanced
    Optimized Decoders describes the mechanisms for decoding simple types of an XML
    document using advanced optimised decoders. \nThe binary format for XML described
    in this specification can be used for encoding MPEG-7 and MPEG-21 descriptions,
    as specified in ISO/IEC 15938-1 (MPEG-7 Systems) and 21000-16 (MPEG-21 Binary
    Format), respectively. "
