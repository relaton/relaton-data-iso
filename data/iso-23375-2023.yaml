- content: |-
    This document specifies basic control strategies, minimum functional requirements, basic driver interface elements, and test procedures for verifying the system requirements for collision evasive lateral manoeuvre systems (CELM).
    A CELM is a safety system aimed at supporting the driver’s vehicle operation by avoiding collisions with objects in the forward path of the vehicle. When a collision is predicted, the CELM controls lateral movement of the vehicle by generating yaw moment.
    The lateral control manoeuvres can be performed automatically by CELM or can be initiated by the driver and supported by CELM.
    Specific methods for object detection and other environmental perception technologies are not described in this document.
    This document applies to light vehicles and heavy trucks. Vehicles equipped with trailers are not within the scope of this document.
