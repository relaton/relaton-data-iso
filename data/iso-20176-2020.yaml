    This document provides the specifications and procedures for using the H-point machine (HPM)[1] to audit vehicle seating positions. The HPM is a physical tool used to establish key reference points and measurements in a vehicle. The H-point design tool (HPD) is a simplified computer-aided design (CAD)[2] version of the HPM, which can be used in conjunction with the HPM to take the optional measurements specified in this document, or used independently during product design.
    These H-point devices provide a method for reliable layout and measurement of occupant seating compartments or seats. This document specifies the procedures for installing the H-point machine (HPM) and using the HPM to audit (verify) key reference points and measurements in a vehicle.
    The devices are intended for application at designated seating positions. They are not to be construed as tools that measure or indicate occupant capabilities or comfort. They are not intended for use in defining or assessing temporary seating, such as folding jump seats.
    [1] All references to H-point machine or HPM in this document refer to the SAE J4002 H-point machine (HPM-II), unless otherwise noted.
    [2] CAD has come to encompass any software system or approach to automotive design and development, and is often used to refer to CAE (computer-assisted engineering) and CAM (computer-assisted manufacturing) software systems as well.
