    ISO/IEC 15940:2006 defines the software engineering environment (SEE) services conceptually in a reference model that can be adapted to any SEEs to automate one or more software engineering activities.
    It describes services that support the process definitions as in ISO/IEC 12207 so that the set of SEE Services are compatible with ISO/IEC 12207.
    ISO/IEC 15940:2006 can be used either as a general reference, or to define an automated software process.
