    This document defines the requirements and operation of the on-board vehicle equipment that enables magnetic field wireless power transfer (MF-WPT) between supply device and electric vehicles (EV). It is intended to be used for passenger cars and light commercial vehicles.
    This document addresses the following aspects for an EV device:
    —     safety requirements;
    —     transferred power and power transfer efficiency;
    —     ground clearance of the EV device;
    —     functionality with associated off-board systems under various conditions and independent of manufacturer (interoperability);
    —     test procedures.
    This document does not provide:
    —     requirements for dynamic (vehicle in motion) applications;
    —     requirements for reverse WPT;
    —     requirements for the operation of EV devices specified in this document with supply devices according to IEC 61980-4.
    EV devices that fulfil the requirements of this document are intended to operate with supply devices that fulfil the MF-WPT related requirements of IEC 61980-1, IEC 61980-2 and IEC 61980-3.
    NOTE            IEC 61980-4 specifies requirements for supply devices of power levels above the limits of the reference supply power circuits in this document. Requirements related to dynamic applications of supply devices are specified in IEC 61980-5 and IEC 61980-6.
