abstract:
- content: This document provides requirements and guidance for the effective planning,
    design, and development of instructional video for information technology products
    and services. Videos and animation can present instructions for installation,
    operation, maintenance, and disposal for skilled or unskilled users. This document
    includes the use of video, interactive or hyper-video, animation, virtual or augmented
    reality to explain how to use systems, including software systems. Instructional
    videos can include tutorials with prepared use cases or examples. This document
    covers both short video segments and the use of video and animation in larger
    information products. Instructional videos can include concepts, instructional
    steps, and reference material. This document specifies content elements, structure,
    and use of media, including music, narration, captions, titles, and graphics.
    This document does not include specification of output media formats, content  management
    for videos, or archiving. This document does not cover learning technology systems
    for recording and administering training programs.
