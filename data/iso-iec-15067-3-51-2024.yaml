  script: Latn
  content: This document specifies a Narrow AI Engine Framework including requirements
    for the Energy Management Agent (EMA) specified in ISO/IEC 15067-3. This standard
    includes specifications for an AI infrastructure to be embedded in an EMA serving
    a single structure (home or building) or community housing such as an apartment
    complex. The Narrow AI Engine specified in this standard for EMAs enables demand
    response functionality to be located in each EMA instead of an external energy
    management system. Thus, energy management can be adapted to local and customer
    needs. The Narrow AI Engine includes operational principles such as prediction,
    decision–making, and control. This standard builds upon the EMA functions of ISO/IEC
    15067-3 and ISO/IEC 15067-3-3. The AI functions specified in this standard support
    complex decisions about energy management for devices attached to home and buildings
    networks. These AI specifications enable the EMA to allocate power from public
    sources (including conventional and nonconventional sources) and local sources
    (wind, solar, and storage) according to price, availability, appliance and electric
    vehicle demands, customer preferences, and the customer’s budget.
