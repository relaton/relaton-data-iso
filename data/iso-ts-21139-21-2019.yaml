    This document describes the test method for light stability and ozone stability for commercial prints, which are displayed in indoor bright places in or near to windows, especially in display windows with air conditioning.
    This document also provides guidelines for data analysis.
    This document is applicable to the various product classes of "commercial prints" that, following the terminology of ISO/TR 19300, include commercial production prints (flyers, brochures), transactional and stationary prints, signage, newspapers and periodical prints, book printing as well as packaging printing. These commercial prints often contain combinations of text, pictorial images and/or artwork. Prints for non-commercial use, including prints used and displayed in consumer home environments and prints exhibited or stored in museum context, are outside the scope of this document.
    This document is applicable to both analogue and digitally printed matter. Methods and principles apply to both, colour and monochrome prints.
