    ISO 22762 applies to elastomeric seismic isolators used to provide buildings or bridges with protection from earthquake damage. The isolators covered consist of alternate elastomer layers and reinforcing steel plates. They are placed between a superstructure and its substructure to provide both flexibility for decoupling structural systems from ground motion, and damping capability to reduce displacement at the isolation interface and the transmission of energy from the ground into the structure at the isolation frequency.
    ISO 22762-3:2005 specifies the requirements for elastomeric seismic isolators used for buildings and the requirements for the rubber material used in the manufacture of such isolators. The specification covers requirements, design rules, manufacturing tolerances, marking and labelling and test methods for elastomeric isolators.
