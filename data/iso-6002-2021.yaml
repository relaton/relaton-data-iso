    This document specifies the requirements for bolted bonnet steel gate vales having the following features:
    —     bolted bonnet;
    —     outside screw and yoke;
    —     inside screw (alternative for PN 10, PN 16, Class 150, PN 25 and PN 40 only);
    —     single or double obturator;
    —     wedge or parallel seating;
    —     with or without non-metallic obturator or seat seals;
    —     flanged or butt-welding ends.
    It covers valves of the nominal sizes DN:
    —     10; 15; 20; 25; 32; 40; 50; 65; 80; 100; 125; 150; 200; 250; 300; 350; 400; 450; 500; 600; 700; 800; 900; 1 000;
    corresponding to nominal pipe sizes NPS:
    —     ⅜; ½; ; 1; 1 ¼; 1 ½; 2; 2 ½; 3; 4; 5; 6; 8; 10; 12; 14; 16; 18; 20; 24; 28; 32; 36; 40;
    and applies to valves of the following pressure designations:
    —     PN 10; 16; 25; 40; 63; 100;
    —     Class 150; 300; 600.
    This document applies to bolted bonnet steel gate valves used for all industrial applications.
    Additional requirements given in the relevant application standards can apply to bolted bonnet steel gate valves used for more specific applications (e.g. for the water industry, the chemical and petrochemical process industry, the oil and gas industry).
