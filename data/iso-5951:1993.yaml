  content: Applies to products produced in thicknesses of 1,6 mm and over and widths
    of 600 mm and over, in coils and cut lengths. Hot-rolled sheet less than 600 mm
    wide may be slit from wide sheet and will be considered as sheet. Specifies conditions
    of manufacture (steelmaking, chemical composition, chemical analysis, weldability,
    application, mechanical properties, surface condition), dimensional tolerances,
    sampling, mechanical property test (tensile test, impact test), retests, resubmission,
    workmanship, inspection and acceptance, coil size, information to be supplied
    by the purchaser. Annex A gives information on fabricability.
