abstract:
- content: "ISO/TS 10303-1618:2006 specifies the application module for AP210 interconnect
    design for microwave. \nISO/TS 10303-1618:2006 deals with the representation of
    interconnect design for microwave. The circuit traces may be considered to be
    microstrip or stripline, with a specified shape element of the cross-section (i.e.
    point, edge, cutting plane) acting as the terminal or port of the line or component.
    Use of formal external definitions is provided to link in models with the product
    definition data. Analytical model terminals may be typed as having distributed
    parameters. This data identifies those elements that do not meet design requirements.
    This data includes both design view and usage view of the interconnect product.
    \nThis data provides functional and physical layout information sufficient to
    allow manufacture and test of an interconnect. Design re-use is explicitly supported
    with traceability. Complete traceability back to requirements is provided. Product
    connection requirements, shape requirements, product specifications, process specifications,
    material specifications including manufacturing view of stackup, geometric dimensioning
    and tolerancing are provided. This data identifies those elements that do not
    meet design requirements. This data includes both design view and usage view of
    the interconnect product. Support for specification of signal prioritization is
    provided. Support for specifying the explicit network topology to be implemented
    is provided. Configuration management information and design change management
    information is provided. This data includes at least one geometric representation.
    \nThe following are within the scope of ISO/TS 10303-1618:2006:\n- two dimensional
    layered interconnect substrate; \n- configuration management data; \n- design
    management data; \n- three dimensional layered interconnect substrate; \n- three
    dimensional molded interconnect substrate; \n- material conductivity classification;
    \n- as-routed connections; \n- embedded components; \n- test points; \n- tolerance
    based cutout design; \n- tolerance based cavity design; \n- as-required connections;
    \n- partially routed connections; \n- pre-defined printed templates for design
    re-use; \n- geometric properties for trace layout; \n- geometric properties for
    pad taper layout; \n- explicit definition of terminals of the interconnect substrate;
    \n- explicit definition of cavities and cutouts of the interconnect substrate
    required for components; \n- mapping between the explicit definition of terminals
    and internal design features; \n- printed template definitions with terminals
    defined with a point on a surface; \n- printed template definitions with terminals
    defined using boundary element method; \n- printed template definitions with terminals
    defined with an edge; \n- printed template definitions with terminals defined
    with a cross-section area."
