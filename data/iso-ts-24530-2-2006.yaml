    ISO/TS 24530-2:2006 establishes the XML encoding of the method of Location Referencing used by TPEG applications.
    TPEG applications contain the information required by a client TPEG decoder (i.e. both Location Referencing and event information), to present all the information intended for the end-user when it was originated by the service provider.
    Location Referencing requires a service provider to give an impression or image, to the human end-user, of where an event has taken place. This cannot be done easily because the human end-user may or may not be familiar with the location. tpeg-loc has the added challenge of attempting to be as language independent as possible. This is achieved by the use of tpeg-loc tables (essentially word-oriented data object dictionaries).
