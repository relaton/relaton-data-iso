  content: Specifies a method for the calibration of variable-area flowmeters as used
    in instruments for the determination of air permeance and the roughness/smoothness
    of paper and board. Other meters, such as an electronic mass flowmeter may be
    used, provided their accuracy is at least as good as that of the specified method.
