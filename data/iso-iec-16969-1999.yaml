    This International Standard specifies the mechanical, physical and optical characteristics of 120 mm
    rewritable optical disks with capacities of 3,0 Gbytes and 6,0 Gbytes. It specifies the quality of the recorded and
    unrecorded signals, the format of the data and the recording method, thereby allowing for information interchange
    by means of such disks. The data can be written, read and overwritten many times using the phase change
    method. These disks are identified as +RW.
    This International Standard specifies
    _ two related but different Types of this disk (see clause 7),
    _ the conditions for conformance,
    _ the environments in which the disk is to be tested, operated and stored,
    _ the mechanical, physical and dimensional characteristics of the disk, so as to provide mechanical interchange
    between data processing systems,
    _ the format of the information on the disk, including the physical disposition of the tracks and sectors, the error
    correcting codes and the coding method,
    _ the characteristics of the signals recorded on the disk, thus enabling data processing systems to read the data
    from the disk.
    This International Standard provides for the interchange of disks between optical disk drives. Together with a
    standard for volume and file structure, it provides for full data interchange between data processing systems.
