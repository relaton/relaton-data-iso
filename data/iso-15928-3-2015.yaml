    ISO 15928-3:2015 sets out a method for describing the structural durability performance of houses. It covers objectives, provides performance descriptions, establishes parameter descriptions and outlines evaluation processes.
    ISO 15928-3:2015 is intended for use in the evaluation of the design and construction of houses, in the international trading of houses or their subsystems and in developing quality systems for houses.
    The ISO 15928‑ series does not specify a level of performance and it is not intended to provide a design method and/or criteria.
    NOTE 1       Annex A includes background information on this part of ISO 15928, guidance on its use and suggestions on good practice.
    NOTE 2       Details on references referred to in Notes are provided on Bibliography.
    NOTE 3       Structural safety, serviceability and other attributes are covered in other parts of ISO 15928.
