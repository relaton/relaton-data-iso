  content: "ISO/TR 12470-2:2017 explains a methodology to determine the applicability
    of the results of fire resistance tests to actual applications.\nISO/TR 12470-2:2017
    is applicable to those non-loadbearing elements for which there is an ISO standard
    test procedure based upon the ISO 834 series for determining the fire resistance
    of a representative sample of the construction proposed for use in a specific
    building or just for general use. These elements are:\n-      fire resisting door
    assemblies (excluding lift landing doorsets):\n- -     timber;\n- -     steel;\n-
    \     fire resisting vertical glazing ? metal framed:\nNOTE       The rheology
    of glass is such that gravity has a disproportional influence on fire glass when
    it is heated to high temperatures and as a consequence, it is not possible to
    provide generic guidance on the extended application of horizontal glazed elements.\n-
    -     timber framed;\n-      linear gap sealing;\n-      service penetration sealing.\nFire
    resistance testing furnaces have fairly restricted size limitations and as a consequence,
    there is little confidence that the result obtained on an element of construction
    tested in accordance with the standard methods will behave in a similar manner
    when installed in the final building. \nDirect and extended applications of test
    results are the two possible ways to ensure that an element that is not identical
    to the tested construction will have an acceptable probability of obtaining the
    same fire rating as that of the original tested specimen. In both cases, these
    applications generally refer only to the fire rating that the building element
    can expect to reach if it, or a representative sample of it, were to be tested
    in a furnace according to the standard fire test conditions used in the reference
    test.\nThe criteria and methodology used in evaluating ductwork and dampers is
    significantly different from those used to evaluate conventional separating elements
    and for this reason, these forms of construction are not included in the scope
    of this document. It is planned that a subsequent part of this document may include
    guidance on these elements."
