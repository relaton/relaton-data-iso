  content: "This standard defines a conceptual model of essential indoor features
    to describe indoor spatial environments required commonly in various location-based
    indoor applications. \n\nThe scope includes the following:\n— conceptual structure
    of indoor features and their attributes;\n— spatial associations relationships
    between indoor features.\n\nThe conceptual model in this standard is compatible
    with building model defined in OGC CityGML 3.0, and adds the details of some feature
    types and extends new types. \n\nThis document will provide a common reference
    to guide the collection and organization of indoor spatial information for location-based
    applications in a comprehensive and straightforward way."
