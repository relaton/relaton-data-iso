    ISO 8513:2016 specifies two test methods for determining the longitudinal tensile properties of glass-reinforced thermosetting plastics (GRP) pipes. The properties which can be determined are
    -      the longitudinal tensile strength, and
    -      the percentage ultimate elongation.
    Method A uses, for the test piece(s), a longitudinal strip cut from a pipe.
    Method B uses a specified length of the full cross-section of the pipe.
    Method A is applicable to pipes with a nominal size of DN 50 or greater with circumferentially wound filaments, with or without chopped glass and/or woven rovings and/or fillers, and to centrifugally cast pipes. It is applicable to pipes with helically wound filaments with a nominal size of DN 200 or greater.
    Method B is applicable to all types of GRP pipe. It is usually used for pipes with a nominal size up to and including DN 150.
    Results from one method are not necessarily equal to the results derived from any of the alternative methods. However, all methods have equal validity.
    Annex A describes additional considerations for method B that have been found useful for the testing of thin-walled helically wound pipes and can be used to supplement the basic text.
    NOTE          This International Standard does not address the determination of longitudinal tensile modulus. Due to the multi-layer construction of many GRP pipes, the accurate measurement of strain, necessary for modulus determination, can be very difficult. If it is desired to determine longitudinal modulus, see ISO 527‑4 and/or ISO 527‑5.
