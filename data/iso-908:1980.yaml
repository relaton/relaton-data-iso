abstract:
- content: The method is applicable to products having oxidizing or reducing matter
    contents equal to or greater than 0.001 % (m/m). The principle is based on detection
    of the presence of these matter by a preliminary qualitative test. In the case
    of oxidizing matter adding of potassium iodide solution and titration of the liberated
    iodine with sodium thiosulphate standard volumetric solution until the blue colour
    disappears. In the case of reducing matter transferring of the test portion to
    an exactly measured volume of iodine solution and titration of the excess of iodine
    with the sodium thiosulphate standard volumetric solution. - Cancels and replaces
    ISO Recommendation R 908-1968.
