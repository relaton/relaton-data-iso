    This document provides information on the fire characteristics and performance in fire tests of PVC materials and products for use in building applications.
    It illustrates a number of suitable applications incorporating primarily PVC materials, including unplasticized PVC (PVC-U), plasticized (or flexible) PVC (PVC-P) and chlorinated PVC (PVC-C) based products. Except where otherwise stated, there is no restriction with reference to the content of PVC (in terms of quantity and composition) in the products mentioned in this document.
    This document draws attention to the limits of applicability or the unsuitability of some standard fire test methods for certain applications of PVC based products in buildings.
    This document applies to products during their use phase in the building and does not apply to the manufacturing phase of plastic products. It neither applies to general safety measures applicable to the installation phase nor to the dismantling or the demolition phase of the building.
