abstract:
- content: "ISO/TS 10128:2009 specifies three methods for the adjustment of the digital
    content data that is input to a printing system to achieve consistency in the
    printed results among a number of presses printing to the same general aim conditions.
    These three methods are generally identified as \nThe procedures for establishing
    the aim condition for the necessary transfer curves, the procedures for determining
    the individual transfer curves, and a comparison of the applicability of these
    three methods are included.\nThese adjustment procedures are applicable to printing
    systems that use CMYK colourants but are not restricted to those that use traditional
    ink on paper printing but can involve other marking technologies such as those
    used for proofing and/or digital printing."
