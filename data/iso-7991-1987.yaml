  content: The method deals with the measurement of the change of length of a glass
    fibre under specified conditions. The apparatus including the used dilatometers
    and the possibilities of corretion, the formulae for the final length and the
    expansion coefficient are specified. In the annex, devices for self-adjusting
    alignment of specimen and push-rod axis are described and illustrated.
