  content: 'ISO 15000-3:2004 defines the requirements for the information model for
    the ebXML registry. The ebXML registry describes objects that reside in a repository
    for storage and safekeeping. The information model does not deal with the actual
    content of the repository. All elements of the information model represent metadata
    about the content stored in the repository. Such information is used to facilitate
    ebXML-based Business-to-Business partnerships and transactions. The registry information
    model provides a high-level schema for the ebXML registry. It provides information
    on the type of metadata that are stored in the registry as well as the relationships
    among metadata classes. The registry information model defines what types of objects
    are stored and defines how stored objects are organized. The abstract registry
    is implemented using one or both of the following concrete bindings: a SOAP binding
    using the HTTP protocol, or an ebXML messaging service binding. These specifications
    are compatible with other ebXML specifications.'
