- content: "This document specifies terms and definitions for analytical methods where
    elements are identified and their concentrations determined by measuring X ray
    fluorescence radiation. \nThe aim of this document is to establish terms and definitions
    for TXRF and to match these with terms and definitions relating to X ray fluorescence
    analysis."
