    The scope of ISO/TR 26999:2012 is the use of the so-called process-oriented method (POM) in International Standards, Technical Specifications, Technical Reports and related documents.
    The Technical Report discusses the use of POM in the development of high-level system architectures for intelligent transport systems (ITS). It is based on the results of the work of the FRAME‑S project and the FRAME Forum. Much of the text from Clause 2 through to the end of the document is therefore reproduced by kind permission of the European Commission and the FRAME Forum.
