abstract:
- content: The method specified is based on drawing continuously, at a constant flow
    rate, an air sample through a particle filter before it enters the chemiluminescence
    analyser. It then flows into a reaction chamber where it is mixed with an excess
    flow of ethylene. Ozone and ethylene react instantaneously to produce light in
    the visible region (maximum at about 400 nm). The emitted light intensity is proportional
    to the concentration of ozone in the air sample and is measured by a photomultiplier
    tube. Applies to determination of the mass concentration of ozone between 2 µg/m^3
    and 10 mg/m^3 at the reference conditions.
