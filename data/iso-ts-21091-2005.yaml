abstract:
- content: "ISO/TS 21091:2005 defines minimal specifications for directory services
    for health care using the X.500 framework. This Technical Specification provides
    the common directory information and services needed to support the secure exchange
    of health care information over public networks. ISO/TS 21091:2005 addresses the
    health directory from a community perspective in anticipation of supporting inter-enterprise,
    inter-jurisdiction and international health care communications.\nISO/TS 21091:2005
    also supports directory services aiming to support identification of health professionals
    and organizations and the patients/consumers. The latter services include aspects
    sometimes referred to as master patient indices. \nThe health care directory will
    only support standard LDAP Client searches. Specific implementation guidance,
    search criteria and support are out of scope of this document. "
