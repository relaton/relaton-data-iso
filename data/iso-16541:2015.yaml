- content: |-
    ISO 16541:2015 specifies both a method for sea lice counts on marine finfish farms and a method for sea lice surveillance that can be carried out in any farming area to provide consistent estimates of sea lice infestation.
    It specifies the best practices associated with monitoring sea lice levels on marine finfish farms for various purposes including the assessment of abundance, prevalence, and treatment efficacy. This will include identifying minimum requirements for specific monitoring program elements (e.g. number of fish and cages to be sampled, frequency of sampling, the level of detail recorded, etc.). It will apply to all marine finfish farms which experience infestation with any of the range of "sea lice" (copepodid) parasites.
