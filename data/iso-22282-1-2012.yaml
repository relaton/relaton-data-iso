abstract:
- content: |-
    ISO 22282-1:2012 establishes the general rules and principles for geohydraulic testing in soil and rock as part of the geotechnical investigation services in accordance with EN 1997-1 and EN 1997-2. ISO 22282-1:2012 defines concepts and specifies requirements relating to permeability measurement in soil and rock.
    The different purposes of geohydraulic testing are to obtain information on the permeability of soil or rock in natural or treated states, transmissivity and storage coefficient, and hydrodynamic parameters of aquifers.
    Geohydraulic testing is used for many purposes, such as:
    ISO 22282-1:2012 deals with the execution of tests with groundwater and does not explicitly consider other fluids and suspensions. The flow of other fluids and suspensions can be considered by applying the different viscosities and relations between transmissivity, permeability coefficient and intrinsic permeability.
