abstract:
- content: 'This part specifies the general performance of the test for fibre furnish
    analysis. It is applicable to all kinds of pulps and to most papers and boards,
    including those containing more than one kind of fibre, taking into account different
    pulping processes. This method is less suitable for heavily impregnated or highly
    coloured papers and boards. The standard describes in detail: principle, reagents,
    apparatus, preparation of the test piece, staining and preparation of fibre slides,
    test procedure, quantitative analysis, expression of results, test report.'
