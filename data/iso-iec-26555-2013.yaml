  content: "ISO/IEC 26555:2013 deals with the capabilities of tools and methods of
    Software and Systems Product Line (SSPL) Technical Management. Since product lines
    deal with multiple products that have similarities, product lines have an unprecedented
    level of technical management complexities.\nIn the product line there are inherent
    differences in technical considerations due to the parallel development processes,
    domain and application engineering. The two processes are tightly related with
    each other centered around assets, and the close relationships among domain engineering,
    application engineering, and assets require highly matured managerial capabilities.\nTechnical
    management provides management support for a timely and proper deployment of product
    line in balance with pre-defined product line objectives such as reusability,
    reducing cost, and improving quality, as well as its planned cost, schedule, and
    resources. Technical management addresses actual means used to support, monitor,
    and control the activities of both domain engineering and application engineering
    of a product line. \nThere are needs for defining product line specific technical
    management processes that integrate the involved product line disciplines with
    those for a single product. Furthermore, support of tools and methods are required
    so that a product line organization can perform technical management under the
    systematic control of complexities.\nISO/IEC 26555:2013 addresses the product
    line specific processes in technical management by dividing those into Process
    Management, Variability Management, Asset Management, and Support Management areas
    with the guidance of a set of tools and methods capabilities for supporting tasks
    for product line technical management.\nISO/IEC 26555:2013 is intended to benefit
    people who acquire, supply, develop, operate, and maintain tools and methods for
    product line technical management. ISO/IEC 26555:2013 can be used in one or more
    of the following modes:\n1) By an organization intended to implement product lines,
    to understand, adopt, and enact the processes, tools, and methods for product
    line technical management. This also helps the organization to evaluate and select
    relevant tools and methods based on business and user-related criteria.\n2) By
    a tool vendor who facilitates or leverages product line engineering practices,
    to provide a set of tool capabilities that should be embodied in a tool for supporting
    product line technical management."
