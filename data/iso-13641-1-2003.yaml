  content: "ISO 13641-1:2003 specifies a screening method for assessing the potential
    toxicity of substances, mixtures, surface waters, groundwaters and wastewaters,
    effluents, sludges or other environmental samples by determining the production
    of biogas (carbon dioxide and methane) from the anaerobic digestion of sewage
    sludge over periods of up to 3 days. The growth rate of anaerobic bacteria is
    much lower compared with that of aerobic microorganisms. For this reason, the
    test periods are longer for anaerobic methods than those used for aerobic bacteria.\nThis
    method is applicable to substances, soluble or insoluble in water, including volatile
    chemicals. \nNote that special care is necessary with compounds of low water-solubility,
    and in these cases, other methods might be more suitable.\nThis method can provide
    information that is useful in predicting the likely effect of a test material
    on biogas production in anaerobic digesters. For example, only longer tests, which
    simulate working digesters more closely can indicate whether adaptation of the
    microorganisms to the test material can occur or whether compounds likely to be
    adsorbed onto sludge can build up to a toxic concentration over a longer period
    than allowed in this test.\nInformation obtained by ISO 13641-1:2003 can also
    be helpful in choosing suitable initial mass concentrations for anaerobic biodegradability
    tests (e.g. ISO 11734). However, ISO 13641-1:2003 using undiluted sludge is less
    suitable for testing dilute digesting sludge than the method described in ISO
    13641-2 where the mass concentrations are a hundredfold more dilute."
