    This document specifies the technical delivery conditions for steel pipes (casing, tubing and pup joints), coupling stock, coupling material and accessory material.
    By agreement between the purchaser and manufacturer, this document can also be applied to other plain-end pipe sizes and wall thicknesses.
    This document is applicable to the following connections:
    —     short round thread casing (SC);
    —     long round thread casing (LC);
    —     buttress thread casing (BC);
    —     non-upset tubing (NU);
    —     external upset tubing (EU);
    —     integral-joint tubing (IJ).
    NOTE 1  For further information, see API Spec 5B.
    For such connections, this document specifies the technical delivery conditions for couplings and thread protection.
    NOTE 2  Supplementary requirements that can optionally be agreed for enhanced leak resistance connections (LC) are given in A.9 SR22.
    This document can also be applied to tubulars with connections not covered by ISO or API standards.
    This document is applicable to products including the following grades of pipe: H40, J55, K55, N80, L80, C90, R95, T95, P110, C110 and Q125.
    This document is not applicable to threading requirements.
    NOTE 3  Dimensional requirements on threads and thread gauges, stipulations on gauging practice, gauge specifications, as well as, instruments and methods for inspection of threads are given in API Spec 5B.
