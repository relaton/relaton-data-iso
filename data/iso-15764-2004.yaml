- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: ISO 15764:2004 describes an extension of data link protocols for enhancing
    the security of data transfers between electronic control units (ECUs) connected
    by a communication network used in road vehicles. It is based on cryptographic
    methods that include encryption, digital signatures and message authentication
    codes (MACs). It provides a description of services to establish ECUs as trusted
    parties in respect of one another and to protect against specific threats. It
    is applicable to all data links between pairs of ECUs capable of storing and processing
    secret data so that unauthorised third parties are denied access to it. Parameters
    are provided to enable the level of security in the data link to be selected.
