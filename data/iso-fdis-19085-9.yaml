abstract:
- content: "This document specifies the safety requirements and measures for circular
    saw benches with or without sliding table and/or demountable power feed unit and
    capable of continuous production use, also known as “table saws” (in the USA),
    hereinafter referred to also as “machines”.\nThe machines are designed to cut
    wood and material with similar physical characteristics to wood.\nIt deals with
    all significant hazards, hazardous situations and events as listed in Annex A
    relevant to the machines when operated, adjusted and maintained as intended and
    under the conditions foreseen by the manufacturer; reasonably foreseeable misuse
    has been considered too. Transport, assembly, dismantling, disabling and scrapping
    phases have also been taken into account.\nIt is also applicable to machines fitted
    with one or more of the following devices, or working unit, whose hazards have
    been dealt with:\n— device for the main saw blade and scoring saw blade to be
    raised and lowered through the table;\n— device to tilt the main saw blade and
    scoring saw blade for angled cutting;\n— device for scoring;\n— device for grooving
    with milling tool with a width not exceeding 20 mm in one pass;\n— demountable
    power feed unit;\n— additional manually operated sliding table;\n— powered workpiece
    clamping device.\nThis document does not apply to:\na) machines intended for outdoor
    use on building sites;\nNOTE 1\tBuilding site saws (contractor saws) are covered
    by the requirements of ISO 19085 10:2018.\nb) handheld woodworking machines including
    any adaptation permitting their use in a different mode, i.e., bench mounting;\nc)
    machines intended for use in a potentially explosive atmosphere;\nd) machines
    manufactured prior to the date of its publication as an International Standard."
