abstract:
- content: |-
    This document specifies a methodology for establishing quantitative performance data for oil skimmers for recovery of oil with light and medium viscosity (up to 50 000 cP), so the end user can objectively judge, compare, and evaluate the design and performance of different skimmers. The methodology applies to testing in a basin and requires control of oil properties and oil slick characteristics.
    The method is applicable to all types of skimmers provided that the equipment dimensions are within the physical limitations of the test basin. The test procedure provides the full-scale test results for the unit tested, under controlled conditions, and for one or more classes of oil. Attention is drawn to the care required when applying the test results to predict skimmer performance under field conditions.
    For dedicated/in-built systems, the test procedures outlined in this document can only be used for the skimming device as such, not for the entire skimming system.
