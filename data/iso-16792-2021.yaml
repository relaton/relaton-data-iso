abstract:
- content: |-
    This document specifies requirements for the preparation, revision and presentation of digital product definition data, hereafter referred to as data sets, complementing existing standards. It supports two methods of application: 3D model-only and 3D model with 2D drawing in digital format. The structure of this document presents requirements common to both methods followed by clauses providing for any essential, differing requirements for each method. Additionally, its use in conjunction with computer-aided design (CAD) systems can assist in the progression towards improved modelling and annotation practices for CAD and engineering disciplines, as well as serving as a guideline for CAx software developers.
    The actual definitions for the interpretation, in particular the ISO TPD and ISO GPS rules, are taken from the original definition standards, e.g. ISO 129-1 and ISO 1101.
    When the term model is used in this document it applies to both design models and annotated models.
