    This document provides a summary of general guidance for the design of geosynthetics to fulfil the function of stabilization of granular layers in contact with natural soils, fills, asphalt or other materials.
    The concepts of the summarised guidance are based on installed materials, the installation process and on either the strength or deformation behaviour, or both, of geosynthetics.
    This document provides general considerations to support the design of unbound layers of paved and unpaved roads, working platforms and foundations utilizing the stabilization function of geosynthetics. This is typically for the serviceability limit state (SLS).
