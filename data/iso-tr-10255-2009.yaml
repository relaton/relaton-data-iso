abstract:
- content: "ISO/TR 10255:2009 gives recommendations and provides guidance for maintaining
    archival optical disk collections. It describes the various services that would
    be necessary for the management of an optical media‑based system to ensure a successful
    implementation of this technology. \nISO/TR 10255:2009 also\n- provides guidance
    in the maintenance of data residing on on-line, off-line, and near-line digital
    optical storage devices;\n- establishes a plan to ensure the migration path of
    digital information from early and current technology and optical media to future
    technologies and media;\n- provides guidance for the short- and long-term effect
    of the finite life of digital optical storage devices.\nISO/TR 10255:2009 also
    describes all forms of optical disk media including write-once-read-many (WORM),
    magneto-optical (MO), compact disk (CD), digital versatile disk (DVD) and newer
    technologies."
