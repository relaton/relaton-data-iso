    Field devices are a key component in intelligent transport systems (ITS). Field devices include traffic signals, message signs, weather stations, traffic sensors, roadside equipment for connected ITS (C-ITS) environments, etc.
    Field devices often need to exchange information with other external entities (managers). Field devices can be quite complex necessitating the standardization of many data concepts for exchange. As such, the ISO 20684 series is divided into several individual parts.
    This part of the ISO 20684 series identifies basic user needs for the management of virtually any field device and traces these needs to interoperable designs. This includes the ability to identify the device, its capabilities, and its status.
    NOTE       This document is similar to portions of NTCIP 1103 v03 and NTCIP 1201 v03.
    ISO 20684-1 provides additional details about how the ISO 20684 series relates to the overall ITS architecture.
