    This document specifies general safety requirements for self-loading mobile concrete mixers (here-after referred to as “machines”) as defined in ISO 18650-1:2021, with rigid or articulated wheeled chassis.
    This document applies to machines which are designed for front or rear loading and are provided with a swinging frame where the rotating drum and the self-loading equipment (lift arms and bucket) are mounted on. Machines are also fitted with accessories such as water dosing means and a weighing system.
    This document deals with all significant hazards, hazardous situations and events relevant to the machine when used as intended or under conditions of misuse reasonably foreseeable by the manufacturer.
    This document is not applicable to the following:
    a)       machines designed primarily for earth moving, such as loaders or dumpers (see applicable parts of the ISO 20474 series);
    b)       truck mixers.
    This document does not address hazards that can occur:
    —     during manufacture;
    —     when using machines on public roads, where specific local road regulations can apply;
    —     when operating in potentially explosive atmospheres.
    This document is not applicable to machines manufactured before the date of its publication.
