  content: Specifies geometrical tests for single chain mortising machines for general
    purpose use and normal accuracy, gives the corresponding permissible deviation
    and furthermore the nomenclature appropriate to each part of the machine in English
    and French as well as the equivalent terms in German, Spanish, Italian and Swedish.
    It deals only with the verification of the accuracy of the machine. It does not
    apply to the testing of the running of the machine or to its characteristics which
    should generally be checked before the accuracy is tested. Does not impose any
    practical test.
