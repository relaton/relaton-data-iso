  content: "ISO 18916:2007 specifies the procedure for the photographic activity and
    dye coupler reactivity tests. \nISO 18916:2007 is applicable to general photographic
    enclosure materials such as paper, tissue, cardboard, mat board and plastics.
    It is also applicable to components of photographic enclosure materials such as
    adhesives, inks, paints, labels, and tape.\nISO 18916:2007 evaluates possible
    chemical interactions between enclosures with processed silver-gelatin, colour
    (dye-gelatin), inkjet prints made with dye-based and pigment-based inks, thermal
    dye diffusion transfer (“dye sub”) prints, digitally printed dye-diffusion-transfer
    prints, liquid- and dry-toner xerographic prints, liquid-toner electrostatic prints,
    and diazo images after long-term storage. It does not pertain to harmful physical
    interactions such as blocking (sticking together), dye bleed, adhesive migration,
    or plasticizer exudation. It does not pertain to important criteria of enclosures
    such as their inherent chemical stability, physical integrity, and workmanship.
    Passing the photographic activity test (PAT) does not indicate that a material
    is archival. This term has no clear definition and is not used in this standard.
    Photo-safe, storage enclosures and their components are covered in ISO 18902,
    which includes passing the criteria of the photographic activity test.\nIf a particular
    brand of commercially made enclosure materials is found to be safe for long-term
    storage purposes, there is no assurance that subsequent batches will contain the
    same ingredients of the same purity, chemical inertness, concentrations, or sound
    and sturdy construction. For this reason, materials are tested annually or upon
    each formulation or supplier change. For materials which are manufactured in a
    variety of colours, such as papers and inks, each colour is evaluated and reported
    separately."
