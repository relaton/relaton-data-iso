  content: This document specifies a test method for the determination of heating
    performances of wearable electric heating textile products. Wearable heating textile
    products are made of e-textiles parts including a movable battery for electric
    heating and conventional textiles parts for garments such as jackets, jumpers,
    etc. This document includes the test procedure for the heating temperature and
    power consumption of wearable heating textile products. This document is not applied
    to household electrical heaters and medical devices.
