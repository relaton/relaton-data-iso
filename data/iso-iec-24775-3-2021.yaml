  content: Storage Management Technical Specification, Part 3 Common Profiles, 1.8.0
    Rev 4 defines profiles that are supported by profiles defined in the other parts
    of this standard. The first few clauses provide background material that helps
    explain the purpose and profiles. Common port profiles are grouped together since
    they serve as transport-specific variations of a common model. The port profiles
    are followed by other common profiles.
