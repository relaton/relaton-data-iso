    The technology of bar coding is based on the recognition of patterns encoded in bars and spaces of defined dimensions. There are numerous methods of encoding information in bar code form, known as symbologies. Code 128 is one such symbology. The rules defining the translation of characters into bar and space patterns, and other essential features of each symbology, are known as the symbology specification.
    In the past, symbology specifications were developed and published by a number of organizations, resulting in certain instances in conflicting requirements for certain symbologies.
    Manufacturers of bar code equipment and users of bar code technology require publicly available standard symbology specifications to which they can refer when developing equipment and software.
    ISO/IEC 15417:2007 specifies the requirements for the bar code symbology known as Code 128. It specifies Code 128 symbology characteristics, data character encodation, dimensions, decoding algorithms and the parameters to be defined by applications. It specifies the symbology identifier prefix strings for Code 128 symbols.
