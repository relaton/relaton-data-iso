abstract:
- content: "ISO 15926-2:2003 specifies a conceptual data model for computer representation
    of technical information about process plants. The information required by the
    following activities is within the scope of ISO 15926-2:2003:\n- specification
    of requirements to produce, process, and transport process materials;\n- specification
    of functions required to produce and process the required materials, including
    the following:hydrocarbon process and conditioning systems,injected gas and water
    conditioning and injection systems,oil and gas product transport systems,safety
    and control systems,electricity generation and supply systems,steam generation
    and supply systems,structures,buildings and accommodation;\n- specification and
    selection of materials and equipment to provide the required production and processing
    functions, including information about market available materials and equipment;\n-
    installation and commissioning of plant equipment;\n- production and process operations,
    including process conditions and consumption, yields and quality of process material;\n-
    maintenance and replacement of equipment.\nThe following activities are outside
    the scope of ISO 15926-2:2003: \n- construction of buildings, production facilities
    and equipment. \nISO 15926-2:2003 is a part of ISO 15926, an International Standard
    for the representation of process plant life-cycle information. This representation
    is specified by a generic, conceptual data model designed to be used in conjunction
    with reference data: standard instances that represent information common to a
    number of users, process plants, or both. The use and definition of reference
    data for process plants is the subject of Parts 4, 5 and 6 of ISO 15926."
