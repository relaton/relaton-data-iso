abstract:
- content: Applies to rolling bearings, other than tapered roller bearings. The term
    airframe is defined. Both metric and inch series bearings are included because
    of established usage in the aircraft industry. The bearings included in ISO 1002
    are usually full complement bearings with basically cylindrical bore and outside
    surface and are sealed or shielded.
