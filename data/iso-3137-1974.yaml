  script: Latn
  content: This part contains a method for taking laboratory samples intended for
    the determination of the water content and the preparations of the test samples.
    Contains instructions for handling with the material. Applicable for taking samples
    of this highly corrosive liquid from road and rail tanks, drums and cylinders.
    The principle consists in allowing the liquid of one of these containers to flow
    in a cooled evacuated stainless steel cylinder or cylinders of not less than 1
    kg total capacity. The apparatus for sampling is shown in a figure. Part Two deals
    with the preparation of the test sample by introduction of the liquid into a polyolefin
    cylinder containing two layers of ice. Has also been approved by the IUPAC.
