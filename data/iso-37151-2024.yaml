    This document specifies principles and requirements for the definition, identification, optimization and harmonization of community infrastructure performance metrics. It provides recommendations for the analysis of community infrastructure, including availability, interoperability, synergy, resilience, safety, security and sustainability.
    Community infrastructure includes, but is not limited to, energy, water, transportation, waste and ICT.
    The principles and requirements of this document are applicable to communities of any size sharing geographic areas that are planning, commissioning, managing, and assessing, all or any element of its community infrastructure. However, the selection and the importance of metrics or (key) performance indicators of community infrastructures are a result of the application of this document and depends on the characteristics of each community.
    In this document, the concept of smartness is addressed in terms of performance relevant to technologically implementable solutions, in accordance with the sustainable development and resilience of communities.
    NOTE            This document does not address measurement, reporting or verification. For possible deliverables related to this document, see ISO/TR 37150:2014, Clause 6. This document does not compare different communities, but allows communities to assess community infrastructure more effectively.
