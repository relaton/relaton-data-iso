- content: |-
    This document defines a reference model and base components for representing and controlling a single LAE or multiple LAEs in an MAR scene. It defines concepts, a reference model, system framework, functions and how to integrate a 2D/3D virtual world and LAEs, and their interfaces, in order to provide MAR applications with interfaces of LAEs. It also defines an exchange format necessary for transferring and storing LAE-related data between LAE-based MAR applications.
    This document specifies the following functionalities:
    a)    definitions for an LAE in MAR;
    b)    representation of an LAE;
    c)    representation of properties of an LAE;
    d)    sensing of an LAE in a physical world;
    e)    integration of an LAE into a 2D/3D virtual scene;
    f)     interaction between an LAE and objects in a 2D/3D virtual scene;
    g)    transmission of information related to an LAE in an MAR scene.
    This document defines a reference model for LAE representation-based MAR applications to represent and to exchange data related to LAEs in a 2D/3D virtual scene in an MAR scene. It does not define specific physical interfaces necessary for manipulating LAEs, that is, it does not define how specific applications need to implement a specific LAE in an MAR scene, but rather defines common functional interfaces for representing LAEs that can be used interchangeably between MAR applications.
