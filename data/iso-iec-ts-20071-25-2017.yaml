  content: "ISO/IEC TS 20071-25:2017 provides recommendations on the audio presentation
    of captions/subtitles and other on-screen text for use in all type of videos regardless
    of the language and technology being used to transmit and present the recorded
    or live video.\nISO/IEC TS 20071-25:2017 applies to making captions/subtitles
    and other on-screen text accessible to users with various needs, including but
    not limited to people with learning and reading disabilities, people with cognitive
    disabilities, people who are blind or have low vision, older people, and non-native
    language speakers. It does not apply to captions/subtitles or other on-screen
    text whose content is already provided in the soundtrack in a language and a way
    users can access.\nISO/IEC TS 20071-25:2017 provides guidance on spoken captions/subtitles
    as a stand-alone access service but it also provides guidance on how to integrate
    spoken captions/subtitles, other spoken on-screen text and audio description,
    if needed, in different types of videos.\nNOTE 1       Extensive guidance on audio
    description is provided in ISO/IEC/TS 20071‑21.\nISO/IEC TS 20071-25:2017 does
    not consider the devices or transmission mechanisms used to deliver and play the
    content or the audio presentation of text in videos. These devices include, but
    are not limited to televisions, computers, wireless devices, projection equipment,
    DVD and home cinema equipment, cinema equipment and other forms of user interfaces
    technology. Therefore, this document does not consider transcoding files for the
    various video and audio outputs.\nNOTE 2       Technical matters of transmission
    and distribution are covered by other documents (e.g. MPEG standards and other
    technical standards such as IEC 62731:2013). \nISO/IEC TS 20071-25:2017 acknowledges
    the various needs and preferences of users, as well as the different approaches
    to the audio presentation of text in videos.\nIt applies to audio presentations
    intended to be heard simultaneously along with the original video."
