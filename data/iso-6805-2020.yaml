    This document specifies requirements for wire-reinforced hoses and hose assemblies for underground coal mining applications of nominal sizes 6,3 to 51 for use with:
    —     oil-based hydraulic fluids HH, HL, HM, HR and HV as defined in ISO 6743-4 at temperatures ranging from −40 °C to +120 °C;
    —     water-based fluids HFC, HFAE, HFAS and HFB as defined in ISO 6743-4 at temperatures ranging from −40 °C to +70 °C;
    —     water at temperatures ranging from 0 °C to +70 °C.
    There is a possibility that operation at the extremes of or outside these temperature ranges materially reduce the life of the hose. These hoses are not suitable for use with fluids that have a castor oil or ester base.
