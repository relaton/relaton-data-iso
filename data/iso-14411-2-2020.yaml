abstract:
- content: |-
    This document describes the specifications for spherical polydisperse particulate reference materials with acceptable uncertainty in particle size distribution and describes protocols for their characterization. One potential use of these reference materials is the reliability test of the laser-diffraction instruments and other particle sizing methods.
    This document expresses polydispersity and the related uncertainties in size. Small variations in size can imply large variations in cumulative distribution.
    This document describes the requirements of particulate reference materials, which are intended to be used to test the reliability of various types of particle size measurement apparatus. The requirements for processing, homogeneity and stability assessment as well as for the preparation of certificates, which are not addressed in this document are described in ISO 17034.
