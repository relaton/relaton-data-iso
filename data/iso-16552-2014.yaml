  content: ISO 16552:2014 describes test methods for determining the stopping distance
    during a straight-line braking manoeuvre with the braking system fully operational.
    It applies to heavy vehicles equipped with an anti-lock braking system (ABS),
    including commercial vehicles, commercial vehicle combinations, buses and articulated
    buses as defined in ISO 3833 (trucks and trailers with maximum weight above 3,5
    tonnes and buses and articulated buses with maximum weight above 5 tonnes, according
    to ECE and EC vehicle classification, categories M3, N2, N3, O3, and O4).
