    ISO 11960:2010 specifies the technical delivery conditions for steel pipes (casing, tubing and pup joints), coupling stock, coupling material and accessory material and establishes requirements for three product specification levels (PSL-1, PSL-2, PSL-3). The requirements for PSL-1 are the basis of ISO 11960:2010. The requirements that define different levels of standard technical requirements for PSL-2 and PSL-3, for all grades except H-40, L-80 9Cr and C110, are contained in Annex H.
    For pipes covered by ISO 11960:2010, the sizes, masses and wall thicknesses as well as grades and applicable end-finishes are listed.
    By agreement between the purchaser and manufacturer, ISO 11960:2010 can also be applied to other plain-end pipe sizes and wall thicknesses.
    ISO 11960:2010 is applicable to the following connections in accordance with API Spec 5B: short round thread casing (SC), long round thread casing (LC), buttress thread casing (BC), non-upset tubing (NU), external upset tubing (EU) and integral tubing connections (IJ).
    For such connections, ISO 11960:2010 specifies the technical delivery conditions for couplings and thread protection. Supplementary requirements that can optionally be agreed for enhanced leak resistance connections (LC) are given.
    ISO 11960:2010 can also be applied to tubulars with connections not covered by ISO/API standards.
    The four groups of products to which ISO 11960:2010 is applicable include the following grades of pipe: group 1, including all casing and tubing in grades H, J, K, N and R; group 2, including all casing and tubing in grades C, L, M and T; group 3, including all casing and tubing in grade P; and group 4, including all casing in grade Q.
    Casing sizes larger than label 1: 4-1/2 but smaller than label 1: 10-3/4 can be specified by the purchaser for use in tubing service.
    Supplementary requirements that can optionally be agreed between purchaser and manufacturer for non-destructive examination, fully machined coupling blanks, upset casing, electric-welded casing, tubing and pup joints, impact testing, seal ring couplings, test certificates, tensile testing and sulfide stress cracking testing are given.
    ISO 11960:2010 is not applicable to threading requirements. Dimensional requirements on threads and thread gauges, stipulations on gauging practice, gauge specifications, as well as instruments and methods for inspection of threads are given in API Spec 5B.
