    This document provides technical specifications to facilitate an efficient exchange of electronic information between ships and shore, for coastal transit and port calls, with specific focus on the operational data exchange. It specifies requirements for the safety, security and efficiency enhancement of information.
    This document provides the definition of core data elements for use in electronic port clearance (EPC) messages. It does not define any structuring of messages; it is a general data dictionary for safety, security and operation-related maritime information. Details about message formats and applications are defined in ISO 28005-1.
    The data elements in this document are a superset of the data elements and the data model defined in the IMO Compendium on Facilitation and Electronic Business. The mapping between data elements in this standard and the data elements in the IMO Compendium isdefined in Annex A.
    Part 3 is an update and extension of Part 2. The data elements in Part 3 covers the additional data elements needed to map to the following data sets as defined in the IMO Reference Data Model, as approved by FAL 47 and earlier FAL meetings:
    ·        Maritime Declaration Health
    ·        Just in Time Concept
    ·        Stowaways
    ·        Ship and Company certificates
    ·        Acknowledgment Receipt
    ·        Maritime Service
    ·        Ship registry and Company details
    ·        Inspections
    ·        PSC Inspection History Data
    ·        Ship Reporting Systems
    ·        Ballast Water Arrival Reporting
    ·        Waste Delivery Report
    ·        Advanced Passenger Information
    ·        Verified Gross Mass
