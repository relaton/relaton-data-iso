abstract:
- content: "This document specifies the method and criteria for monitoring corrosion
    states of heat exchange tubes, heat exchange plates, and other components made
    of stainless steel in industrial cooling water by a combination of polarization
    resistance and corrosion potential. \nThis document is applicable to the monitoring
    of the corrosion states of stainless steel in industrial cooling water or similar
    media, as well as the monitoring of the corrosiveness of industrial cooling water.
    The cooling water is generally taken from natural water, tap water, and reclaimed
    water. It is applicable to industrial cooling water with a pH value of 5.0~11.0,
    a temperature of 0℃~60℃, and conductivity greater than 20 S/cm."
