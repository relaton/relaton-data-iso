    ISO 9635-2:2014 specifies construction and performance requirements and test methods for isolating valves, intended for operation in irrigation systems with water at temperatures not exceeding 60 °C, which can contain fertilizers and other chemicals of the types and concentrations used in agriculture.
    It is applicable to isolating irrigation valves of DN 8 in diameter or greater, designed to operate in the fully open and fully closed positions, but which can also operate for extended time periods in any intermediate position.
