  content: "This document establishes requirements for estimating and reporting on
    performance variations observed when cohorts belonging to different demographic
    groups engage with biometric enrolment and recognition systems. In this context,
    performance refers to failure-to-enrol rate, failure-to-acquire rate, shifts in
    comparison score, recognition error rates, and aspects of response and processing
    time (throughput).\nThis document is applicable to the following:\n—    demographic
    group membership;\n—    using phenotypic measures;\n—    reporting on tests;\n—   
    stating statistical uncertainty estimates;\n—    operational thresholds settings;\n—   
    equitability;\n—    procurement agency activities.\nThis document also provides
    terms and definitions to be used when reporting performance variation across demographic
    groups.\nThis document is applicable to:\n—    technology evaluations of algorithms,
    subsystems and systems; \n—    scenario evaluations of systems; \n—    operational
    evaluations of fielded systems. \nApplication of this document does not require
    detailed knowledge of a system’s algorithms but it does require specific knowledge
    of the demographic characteristics for the population of interest."
