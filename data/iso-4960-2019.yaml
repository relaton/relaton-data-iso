    This document specifies the minimum requirements for steel strip of carbon over 0,25 %, in coils and cut lengths.
    The product is applicable to highly stressed parts of many different types and is characterized by close dimensional tolerances and controlled surface finishes.
    The steel strip is produced in a number of types and surface finishes to be compatible with differing applications requirements.
    This document does not apply to alloy steels or stainless steels.
