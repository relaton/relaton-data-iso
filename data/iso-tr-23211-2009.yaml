abstract:
- content: "ISO/TR 23211:2009 provides information about the functional requirements
    of instrumentation for measuring the water level in a well using automated pressure
    transducer methods. \nISO/TR 23211:2009 provides guidance for the proper selection,
    installation and operation of submersible pressure transducers and data loggers
    for the collection of hydrologic data, primarily for the collection of water-level
    data from wells. Basic principles, measurement needs and considerations for operating
    submersible pressure transducers are described and the systematic errors inherent
    in their use are discussed. Standard operational procedures for data collection
    and data processing, as well as applications of transducers for specific types
    of hydrologic investigations are included. Basic concepts regarding the physics
    of pressure and the mechanics of measuring pressure are presented, along with
    information on the electronics used to make and record these measurements. Guidelines
    for transducer calibration, proper use and quality assurance of data also are
    presented. Ground water field applications of pressure transducer systems are
    discussed, as are common problems that may corrupt data, along with suggestions
    for field repairs. \nAn informative annex provides guidance on the types of pressure
    transducers commonly used for water-level measurement and the measurement uncertainty
    associated with them."
