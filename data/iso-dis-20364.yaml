  content: "This document provides guidance and considerations for healthcare organizations
    to deliver diagnostic tests timely and accurately in a pandemic by leveraging
    innovative approaches to overcome the limitations of laboratory capacity as follows:
    \n–\tmitigating threats encountered in providing diagnostic services during a
    pandemic;\n–\tconsideration for quality assurance of diagnostic service provision
    in a pandemic context; and\n–\tpossible response measures to the surge in diagnostic
    demand.\nThis document does not apply to the details for providing pandemic response
    medical tests such as the specimen collection protocols in the specimen collection
    units or screening stations (e.g., Walk-through or Drive-through), experiment
    procedures, and quality management systems of medical laboratories. Also, this
    document omits the pandemic responses related to the medical treatment of infected
    patients in the care units (e.g., emergency unit, in-patient unit) and transferring
    of confirmed patients in the healthcare organization during a pandemic."
