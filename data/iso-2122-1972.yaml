  content: The method is applicable to products corresponding to the general formula
    M2O . xSiO2, where the values of x lie between 1,5 and 3,5 in the case of sodium
    silicates and 1,9 and 3,9 in the case of potassium silicates. Because of the difficulty
    ancountered in dissolving fine particles of these products, the sample is first
    sieved to remove these fines. The procedure consists in dissolution of the test
    portion in carbon dioxide-free water, by treatment in an autoclave. Filtration
    and weighing of the insoluble matter on a tared filter crucible. Dilution of the
    filtrate to a given volume, from which aliquot samples are taken in order to carry
    out the different determinations.
