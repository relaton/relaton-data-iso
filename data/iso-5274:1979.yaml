abstract:
- content: Specifies an acid washing test. Gives some indication of the degree of
    refining but does not give a precise measure of the amount of unsaturated compounds
    present as different unsaturated compounds produce different colourations with
    sulphuric acid. Shaking together of equal volumes of the sample and 95 % (m/m)
    sulphuric acid. Comparison of the colour of the acid layer with that of standard
    matching solutions.
