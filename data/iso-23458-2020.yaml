    This document specifies a test method for determining thermal expansion coefficient up to 2 300 K and the residual stress of chemical vapour deposition (CVD) ceramic coatings (thickness > 0,03 mm) at room temperature. Procedures for test piece preparation, test modes, heat rate, data collection, property calculations and reporting procedures are given.
    This document applies to CVD ceramic coatings on metal or ceramic substrates. This test method can be used for material research, quality control, characterization and design data-generation purposes.
