    ISO/TS 15638-10:2013 addresses the provision of Emergency messaging system/eCall and specifies the form and content of such data required to support such systems, and access methods to that data.
    ISO/TS 15638-10:2013 provides specifications for common communications and data exchange aspects of the application service Emergency Messaging System/eCall that a regulator may elect to require or support as an option, including:
    a)         high level definition of the service that a service provider has to provide [the service definition describes common service elements, but does not define the detail of how such an application service is instantiated, nor the acceptable value ranges of the data concepts defined];
    b)         means to realise the service;
    c)         application data, naming content and quality that an IVS has to deliver.
    The definition of what comprises a regulated service is regarded as an issue for national decision, and may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. This part of ISO 15638 does not impose any requirements on nations in respect of which services for regulated vehicles  jurisdictions will require, or support as an option, but provides standardized sets of requirements descriptions for identified services to enable consistent and cost efficient implementations where instantiated.
