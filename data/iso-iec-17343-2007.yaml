abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 17343:2007 specifies signalling interworking between QSIG and
    the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) in support of basic services within a corporate
    telecommunication network (CN) (also known as enterprise network).\nQSIG is a
    signalling protocol that operates between Private Integrated services Network
    eXchanges (PINX) within a Private Integrated Services Network (PISN). A PISN provides
    circuit-switched basic services and supplementary services to its users. QSIG
    is specified in other Standards.\nNOTE          The name QSIG was derived from
    the fact that it is used for signalling at the Q reference point. The Q reference
    point is a point of demarcation between two PINXs.\nSIP is an application-layer
    protocol for establishing, terminating, and modifying multimedia sessions. It
    is typically carried over IP. Telephone calls are considered a type of multimedia
    session where just audio is exchanged. \nAs the support of telephony within corporate
    networks evolves from circuit-switched technology to Internet technology, the
    two technologies will coexist in many networks for a period, perhaps several years.
    Therefore, there is a need to be able to establish, modify, and terminate sessions
    involving a participant in the SIP network and a participant in the QSIG network.
    Such calls are supported by gateways that perform interworking between SIP and
    QSIG.\nISO/IEC 17343:2007 specifies SIP-QSIG signalling interworking for basic
    services that provide a bi-directional transfer capability for speech, DTMF, facsimile,
    and modem media between a PISN employing QSIG and a corporate IP network employing
    SIP. Other aspects of interworking, e.g., the use of RTP and SDP, will differ
    according to the type of media concerned and are outside the scope of ISO/IEC
    17343:2007.\nCall-related and call-independent signalling in support of supplementary
    services is outside the scope of ISO/IEC 17343:2007, but support for certain supplementary
    services (e.g., call transfer, call diversion) could be the subject of future
    work.\nInterworking between QSIG and SIP permits a call originating at a user
    of a PISN to terminate at a user of a corporate IP network, or a call originating
    at a user of a corporate IP network to terminate at a user of a PISN.\nInterworking
    between a PISN employing QSIG and a public IP network employing SIP is outside
    the scope of ISO/IEC 17343:2007. However, the functionality specified in ISO/IEC
    17343:2007 is in principle applicable to such a scenario when deployed in conjunction
    with other relevant functionality (e.g., number translation, security functions,
    etc.).\nISO/IEC 17343:2007 is applicable to any interworking unit that can act
    as a gateway between a PISN employing QSIG and a corporate IP network employing
    SIP."
