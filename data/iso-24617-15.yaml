  content: "Measurable quantitative information (MQI) describes one of basic properties
    that is associated with the magnitude aspect of quantity, and is very common in
    ordinary language. The main characteristics of MQI, as described in ISO 24617-11[1],
    is that quantitative information is presented as measures expressed in terms of
    a pair of a numerically expressed quantity and a unit. Such information is much
    more abundant in scientific publications or technical reports to the extent that
    it constitutes an essential part of communicative segments of language in general.
    The processing of such information is thus required for any successful language
    resource management.\n\nThis proposal aims to develop a general but mandatory
    framework to extract MQI according to the metamodel defined in ISO 24617-11. The
    proposal specifies a framework for Measureable Quantitative Information Extraction
    (MQIE), consisting of the identification of basic elements (entities, numerals,
    units, and relators), and links (measure links and comparison links). For example,
    as to a sentence “Body mass index must between 20-40kg/m”, it extracts the entity
    “Body mass index”, the numerals “20” and “40”, the unit “kg/m”, the relator “between”,
    as well as measure link between the entity and measure, and comparison link between
    measures. The framework in the proposal generally consists of five mandatory steps
    including: 1) pre-processing, 2) basic element identification, 3) link identification,
    4) measure normalization, and 5) verification and filtering. \n\nOne feature of
    this proposal MQIE is that it provides a general guideline for identifying and
    extracting MQI for carrying out necessary IR and NLP tasks for different applications.
    The second feature is that it is compatible with ISO 24617-11 MQI in concept definition,
    element definition, and representation. Another feature is it output a flexible
    and open representation formats that allows the use of various types of tasks
    that conform to non-ISO standards, guidelines or recommendations as long as they
    are compatible with the ISO Language Research Management (LRM) standards.  \n\nThis
    proposal MQIE is designed to be widely applied in information extraction (IR)
    and natural language processing (NLP) tasks for the identification, aggregation,
    computation and analysis of MQI. The choice of such tasks depends on the type
    of applications and use cases."
