    ISO 14839-2:2004 sets out general guidelines for measuring and evaluating rotating machinery equipped with active magnetic bearings (AMBs) with respect to the following two indices: shaft vibratory displacement measured at or close to the AMBs; and working current and voltage measured in magnetic coils or power supply amplifiers.
    Both indices are measured under nominal operating conditions in house and/or on site. These guidelines are presented in terms of both steady-state running values of these indices and any magnitude changes which may occur in these steady-state operations.
    ISO 14839-2:2004 is applicable to industrial rotating machines generating or consuming nominal power greater than 15 kW, and is not limited by size or operational rated speed (i.e. comprising turbo-compressors, turbo-pumps, steam turbines, turbo-generators, turbo-fans, electric drives and other rotors supported by AMBs). It establishes the vibration, current and voltage evaluation of the rotating machinery equipped with AMBs, specified by a comparatively large power capacity as described above, excluding small-scale rotors such as turbo-molecular pumps, spindles and flywheels.
    ISO 14839-2:2004 covers both AMB-equipped rigid rotors and AMB-equipped flexible rotors.
