abstract:
- content: "ISO 16653:2011 specifies the design, calculations, safety requirements
    and test methods relevant to mobile elevating work platforms (MEWPs) suitable
    for orchard operations. It is intended to be used in conjunction with ISO 16368,
    whose requirements it modifies, supplements or confirms.\nISO 16653:2011 specifies
    the structural design calculations and stability criteria, construction, safety
    examinations and tests to be carried out before a MEWP to be used in orchard operations
    is first put into service. It identifies the hazards arising from the use of MEWPs
    in orchard operations and describes methods for the elimination or reduction of
    those hazards.\nIt is applicable to single-person boom-type MEWPs, controlled
    from the platform and used to move a person to working positions for picking fruit
    and maintaining trees and trellis vines in an orchard. "
