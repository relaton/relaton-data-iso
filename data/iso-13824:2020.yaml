abstract:
- content: |-
    This document specifies general principles of risk assessment for systems involving structures. The focus is on strategic and operational decision-making related to design, assessment, maintenance and decommissioning of structures. This also includes formulation and calibration of related codes and standards. Systems involving structures can expose stakeholders at various levels in society to significant risks. The aim of this document is to facilitate and enhance decision-making with regard to monitoring, reducing and managing risks, and preparing for emergency in an efficient, cost-effective and transparent manner. Within the broader context of risk management, risk assessment provides decision-makers with procedures to determine whether or not, and in what manner, it is appropriate to treat risks.
    This document provides a general framework as well as a procedure for identifying hazards and estimating, evaluating and treating risks of structures and systems involving structures. This document also provides a basis for code writers as well as designers to set reasonable target-reliability levels, such as stated in ISO 2394, based on the result of risk considerations. For existing structures, it is intended that assessment of the risks associated with the events that were not considered in the original design or with changes in use be implemented according to the principles stated in this document. This document can also be used for risk assessment of exceptional structures upon specific adaptation and detailing, the design of which is not usually within the scope of existing codes.
