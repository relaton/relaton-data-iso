    ISO 7870-8:2017 describes ways of applying regular variables control charts to short runs and small mixed batches where the sample size for monitoring is restricted to one. It provides a set of tools to facilitate the understanding of sources of variation in such processes so that the processes can be better managed.
    The charts described are process-focused rather than product-focused. The user can plot, monitor and control similar characteristics on different items, or different characteristics on an item, on a single control chart.
    NOTE 1       The terms short run and small batch size are not well defined. Here, short run and small batch size are taken to mean only a few items are manufactured before a different item is then produced.
    NOTE 2       For situations where the subgroup size is larger than one, other standards apply.
