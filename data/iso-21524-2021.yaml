    This document specifies requirements for the design, testing and classification of active fire curtains, applicable to any material, that are designed to provide fire and smoke resistance.
    This document gives recommendations for the application, installation and maintenance of active fire curtains. It is also intended to provide guidance and recommendations for designers, specifiers (e.g. architects, fire engineers), authorities having jurisdiction (AHJs), installers and maintainers for the following:
    a) creating compartmentation;
    b) creating protected routes for the purpose of means of escape;
    c) providing protection at the location of non-fire resisting elements (e.g. in front of non-fire-resisting glazing and doorsets) where required for compartmentation or protecting means of escape;
    d) providing fire- and smoke-resistant active fire curtains in conjunction with non-smoke rated products protecting openings to reduce leakage of smoke.
    This document does not apply to the following, which are intended for a different use:
    —    barriers made of part of the building’s structure;
    —    theatre/proscenium textile curtains;
    —    smoke barriers according to ISO 21927-1;
    —    door and shutter assemblies according to ISO 3008‑1.
    NOTE 1    Smoke barriers used solely for smoke control are covered by ISO 21927‑1. Such smoke barriers are not considered to be active fire curtains.
    NOTE 2    Requirements of fire doors are given in ISO 3008-1. Requirements for leakage are given in ISO 5925‑1 and further information is given in ISO/TR 5925‑2.
