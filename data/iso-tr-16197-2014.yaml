abstract:
- content: ISO/TR 16197:2014 provides a compilation and description of in vitro and
    in vivo methods that can be useful for the toxicological, including ecotoxicological
    screening of engineered and manufactured nanomaterials. Toxicological screening
    tests included in ISO/TR 16197:2014 can be used for such purposes as early decision-making
    in research and product development, rapid feedback on potential toxicological/safety
    concerns, or for the preliminary assessment of manufactured nanomaterials. ISO/TR
    16197:2014 is divided between screening assays related to humans and screening
    assays related to the environment. A screening test is a relatively simple, inexpensive
    test that can be administered easily and provides an indication of potential adverse
    outcomes and effects on human health or the environment.
