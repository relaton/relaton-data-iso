    This document defines a test method to evaluate the interference rejection performance of tags covered by ISO/IEC 18000-63 and a heterogeneous wireless system using different access technologies, e.g. radio frequency identification and cell phone network.
    It specifies the general requirements and test requirements.
    The test method in this document makes it possible to compare the relative interference rejection performance among tags under a single wireless interference environment. In addition, this document can be used in a benchmarking test according to requirements in a given application or service.
