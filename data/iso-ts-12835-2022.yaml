abstract:
- content: |-
    This document provides procedures for assessment of casing connections for those field applications in which the operating temperatures cyclically vary between minimum values appreciably below 180 °C and maximum values that range from 180 °C to 350 °C or above, and in which the primary axial loading on the casing-connection system is strain-based and driven by constrained thermal expansion and leads to a stress state that exceeds the casing-connection system's yield envelope.
    NOTE This document can be considered complementary to ISO 13679 (and its core content per API Specification 5C5), which applies to classic elastic-design applications.
    This document contains an evaluation procedure for a candidate connection comprising of uniquely defined pin, box and interfacial components. The evaluation procedure includes:
    —    Material property tests to assess relevant properties of the candidate connection pin and box components;
    —    Analytical tasks to determine configuration of connection samples for physical tests, which are chosen based on worst-case combinations of the connection geometry and material properties;
    —    Full-scale testing tasks to measure the candidate connection galling resistance, structural integrity and sealability under loading representative of connection assembly and thermal well service.
    This document does not address impacts of external pressure, incomplete lateral pipe support, rotational fatigue, formation-induced shear, or environmentally-induced corrosion or cracking.
    Clause 6 describes fundamental assumptions adopted in this document.
