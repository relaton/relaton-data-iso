  content: "This International Standard establishes process to measure native vegetation
    that is being logged in native tropical areas following a management forest plan.
    Such process includes quantification and monitoring of the area explored to support
    the analysis of the chain of custody, helping to insure the legal origin of the
    logged material. \nThis International Standard proposes to establish indicators
    that can be used as alerts for the occurrence of a possible inconsistency related
    to the volume of wood contained in the transport and commercialization documentation
    in relation to what occurs in the area indicated as the origin of native timber
    in the tropical forest. This indicator can be obtained by means of metrics (mathematical
    models that establish the correlation between the area of subtracted vegetation
    detected by monitoring data from Remote Sensing and wood volume) to be established
    during the study.\n\nThis International Standard is intended to be used in a holistic
    and global approach, which can be used by any type of organizations in different
    regions and biomes, to measure native vegetation harvesting or extraction, helping
    the long-term sustainability of forest assets. Although intended mainly for areas
    of forest management, such procedures may be used in other areas.\n\nThis International
    Standard aims also to help addressing the growing demands of the international
    market for native tropical wood, allowing for more transparency and environmental
    sustainability.\n\nThis proposal is not intended to establish a Management Systems
    Standards (MSS)."
