  content: "This document provides guidance for deep purification of secondary effluent
    for non-potable reuse by using biological filtration systems in urban areas. It
    specifies general requirements, system selection, biological filtration system
    components, technical requirements of each component, water reuse applications
    and system design considerations.\n\nThis document is applicable to: \na) engineers
    that intend to implement biological filtration systems for deep purification of
    secondary effluent for reuse purposes in terms of design and implement, under
    safe and stable circumstances; \nb) enterprises who assist spreading high-efficiency
    water reuse technology among different countries and accelerate the technological
    progress in the field of secondary effluent reuse."
