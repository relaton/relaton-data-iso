    1.1 This International Standard specifies the requirements for design and construction of piping for the petroleum and natural gas industries, including associated inspection and testing.
    1.2 This International Standard is applicable to all piping within facilities engaged in the processing or handling of chemical, petroleum, natural gas or related products.
    EXAMPLE Petroleum refinery, loading terminal, natural gas processing plant (including liquefied natural gas facilities), offshore oil and gas production platforms, chemical plant, bulk plant, compounding plant, tank farm.
    1.3 This International Standard is also applicable to packaged equipment piping which interconnects individual pieces or stages of equipment within a packaged equipment assembly for use within facilities engaged in the processing or handling of chemical, petroleum, natural gas or related products.
    1.4 This International Standard is not applicable to transportation pipelines and associated plant.
    EXAMPLE Pipeline pump station, pipeline compressor station, pipeline tank farm, offshore platform risers up to and including pig launching facility.
