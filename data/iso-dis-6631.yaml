    This standard provides a method for quantification of type I collagen which was extracted from bovine tissues (e.g. skin, tendon, bone, etc.) with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS).
    The method described in this standard is intended to be used for collagen-based scaffold which will be used for constructing tissue-engineered medical products (TEMPs), and as well as for collagen-based biomaterials used for tissue regeneration and reconstruction or would dressing.
