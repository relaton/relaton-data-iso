  content: "This document specifies requirements and test methods for pipes and fittings
    which are part of piping systems for the rehabilitation by means of renovation
    and trenchless replacement of underground non-pressure and pressure drainage and
    sewerage networks and water supply networks, which transport water intended for
    human consumption, including raw water pipelines.\nIt is applicable to polyethylene
    (PE) pipes, fittings and assemblies, as manufactured and as installed. It is not
    applicable to the existing pipeline.\nIt is applicable to technique families for
    renovation:\n—\tlining with continuous pipes;\n—\tlining with close-fit pipes;\nand
    technique families for trenchless replacement:\n—\tpipe bursting and pipe extraction;
    \n—\thorizontal directional drilling and impact moling.\nand intended to be used
    at an operating temperature of 20 °C as the reference temperature.\nNOTE\tFor
    applications operating at constant temperatures greater than 20 °C and up to 40
    °C, see ISO 4427 1:2019, Annex A.\nWhen used with lining with continuous pipes,
    lining with close-fit pipes and trenchless replacement technique families, this
    document is applicable to:\nPE solid wall single layered pipes, (nominal outside
    diameter, dn), including any identification stripes;\nPE pipes with co-extruded
    layers on either or both the outside and inside of the pipe (total outside diameter,
    dn), as specified in Annex E, where all layers have the same MRS rating.\n\nFurthermore,
    when used with lining with continuous pipes and trenchless replacement this document
    is applicable to:\n—\tPE coated pipes (outside diameter, dn) having a peelable,
    contiguous, thermoplastics additional layer on the outside of the pipe (“coated
    pipe”), as specified in Annex E.\nThis document is applicable to jointing by means
    of butt fusion and electrofusion and to fabricated and injection-moulded fittings
    and mechanical connections of PE."
