abstract:
- content: The SCSI protocol is designed to provide an efficient peer-to-peer I/O
    bus with the maximum number of hosts and peripherals determined by the bus width
    (8 or 16). Data may be transferred asynchronously or synchronously at rates that
    depend primarily on device implementation and cable length. SCSI is an I/O interface
    that may be operated over a wide range of media and transfer rates. This international
    standard defines a Fibre Channel mapping layer (FC-4) that uses the services defined
    by NCITS Project 1311D, Fibre Channel Framing and Signaling Interface (FC-FS)
    to transmit SCSI command, data, and status information between a SCSI initiator
    and a SCSI target. The use of this standard enables the transmission of standard
    SCSI command formats, the transmission of standard SCSI data and parameter strings,
    and the receipt of SCSI status and sense information across the Fibre Channel
    using only the standard Fibre Channel frame and sequence formats. The Fibre Channel
    protocol operates with Fibre Channel Classes of Service 1, 2, and 3 and operates
    across Fibre Channel fabrics and arbitrated loops.
