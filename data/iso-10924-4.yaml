    This document specifies medium circuit breakers with tabs (blade type), Form CB15, for use in road vehicles. It establishes, for this circuit breaker form, the rated current, test procedures, performance requirements and dimensions.
    This document is intended to be used in conjunction with ISO 10924-1 and ISO 10924-2. The numbering of its clauses corresponds to that of ISO 10924-1, whose requirements are applicable, except where modified by requirements particular to this document.
    This document is applicable to circuit breakers with a rated voltage of 14 V (DC) or 28 V (DC) or 58 V (DC), a current rating of no greater than 40 A and a breaking capacity of 2 000 A, intended for use in road vehicles with a nominal voltage of 12 V (DC) or 24 V (DC) or 48 V (DC).
    The circuit breakers are different in dimensions and functions, such as electric reset, automatic reset, manual reset and switchable.
    NOTE         This type of circuit breaker is intended to be used in applications such as medium fuse-links in accordance with ISO 8820-3. While the tab dimensions and current ratings can be the same, there can be differences in performance which the user of these products is advised to consider.
