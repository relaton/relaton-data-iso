abstract:
- content: 'This document specifies the system layer of the coding. It was developed
    principally to support the combination of the video and audio coding methods defined
    in Parts 2 and 3 of ISO/IEC 13818. The system layer supports six basic functions:1)
    the synchronization of multiple compressed streams on decoding;2) the interleaving
    of multiple compressed streams into a single stream;3) the initialization of buffering
    for decoding start up;4) continuous buffer management;5) time identification;6)
    multiplexing and signalling of various components in a system stream.A Rec. ITU-T
    H.222.0 | ISO/IEC 13818-1 multiplexed bit stream is either a transport stream
    or a program stream. Both streams are constructed from PES packets and packets
    containing other necessary information. Both stream types support multiplexing
    of video and audio compressed streams from one program with a common time base.
    The transport stream additionally supports the multiplexing of video and audio
    compressed streams from multiple programs with independenttime bases. For almost
    error-free environments the program stream is generally more appropriate, supporting
    software processing of program information. The transport stream is more suitable
    for use in environments where errors are likely.A Rec. ITU-T H.222.0 | ISO/IEC
    13818-1 multiplexed bit stream, whether a transport stream or a program stream,
    is constructed in two layers: the outermost layer is the system layer, and the
    innermost is the compression layer. The system layer provides the functions necessary
    for using one or more compressed data streams in a system. The video and audio
    parts of this Specification define the compression coding layer for audio and
    video data. Coding of other types of data is not defined by this Specification,
    but is supported by the system layer provided that the other types of data adhere
    to the constraints defined in 2.7.'
