abstract:
- content: "ISO Guide 35:2006 gives statistical principles to assist in the understanding
    and development of valid methods to assign values to properties of a reference
    material, including the evaluation of their associated uncertainty, and establish
    their metrological traceability. Reference materials (RMs) that undergo all steps
    described in ISO Guide 35:2006 are usually accompanied by a certificate and called
    a certified reference material (CRM). This Guide will be useful in establishing
    the full potential of CRMs as aids to ensure the comparability, accuracy and compatibility
    of measurement results on a national or international scale.\nIn order to be comparable
    across borders and over time, measurements need be traceable to appropriate and
    stated references. CRMs play a key role in implementing the concept of traceability
    of measurement results in chemistry, biology and physics among other sciences
    dealing with materials and/or samples. Laboratories use these CRMs as readily
    accessible measurement standards to establish traceability of their measurement
    results to international standards. The property values carried by a CRM can be
    made traceable to SI units or other internationally agreed units during production.
    ISO Guide 35:2006 explains how methods can be developed that will lead to well
    established property values, which are made traceable to appropriate stated references.
    It covers a very wide range of materials (matrices), ranging from gas mixtures
    to biological materials, and a very wide range of properties, ranging from chemical
    composition to physical and immunoassay properties. "
