    ISO 13270:2013 specifies definitions and symbols, classification and codes, dimensions, masses and permissible variations, inspection methods, packing, delivery and storage for steel fibres for concrete.
    ISO 13270:2013 covers fibres intended for use in fibre-reinforced concrete, in all types of concrete and mortar, including sprayed concrete, flooring, precast, in situ and repair concretes.
    ISO 13270:2013 can also be referred to for fibres used in fibre-reinforced engineering material, such as stainless steel fibre use in reinforced refractory material.
