- content: |-
    The purpose of ISO 16711:2015 is to reduce the risk of seismic damage by structural collapse or turnover during a seismic event.
    It provides frameworks and principles of methods of detailed seismic assessment and the judgment, seismic retrofit plan and design, seismic retrofit execution of existing reinforced concrete structures before the occurrence of a severe earthquake and of the structures struck by an earthquake.
    It is applicable to reinforced concrete structures and pre-stressed concrete structures that have been designed on the basis of the structural design criteria set in a specific country or region. It is not applicable to either unreinforced concrete or masonry structures.
