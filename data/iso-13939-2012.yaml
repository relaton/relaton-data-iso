    ISO 13939:2012 describes a method of comparing the performance test results of foil journal bearings, which are lubricated by air (gas) and supported by hydrodynamic force generated by the rotation of the rotating shaft. The test procedure proposed in ISO 13939:2012 aims to predict and evaluate the static load capacity, friction coefficient and lifetime of the foil journal bearing, and compare the results with those occurring under different test conditions, i.e. dimensions of a foil bearing, rotational speed of a shaft, pressure and humidity of surroundings and so on. The magnitude of the static load capacity can change according to the test setting, as the test conditions can be changed.
    The test method described in ISO 13939:2012 has the following application coverage:
    - the criterion of the static load capacity is the steady-state, i.e. it is applied in a limited operating condition with a uniform magnitude, load direction and rotational speed;
    - the evaluation procedure can be applied only if the foil journal bearing is under a uniform rotating inertia at an arbitrary rotational speed;
    - the dynamic load with a time-variant magnitude and direction is not taken into consideration.
