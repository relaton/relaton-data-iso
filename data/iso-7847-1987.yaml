abstract:
- content: Specifies an enzymic method, which is not applicable to fats and oils containing
    polyunsaturated fatty acids of the omega-8 and omega-9 series or containing branched
    chain fatty acids. The method consists in saponifying of a test portion at ambient
    temperature followed by liberation of the fatty acids; enzymic oxidation of the
    fatty acids; measurement, at the wavelength of maximum absorbance (about 235 nm)
    of the absorbance due to these oxidized acids, while compensating for the absorbance
    due to any dienoic conjugated acids initially present in the sample.
