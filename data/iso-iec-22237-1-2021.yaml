    This document:
    a) describes the general principles for data centres upon which the requirements of the ISO/IEC22237 series are based;
    b) defines the common aspects of data centres including terminology, parameters and reference models (functional elements and their accommodation) addressing both the size and complexity of their intended purpose;
    c) describes general aspects of the facilities and infrastructures required to support data centres;
    d) specifies a classification system, based upon the key criteria of “availability”, “security” and “energy-efficiency” over the planned lifetime of the data centre, for the provision of effective facilities and infrastructure;
    e) details the issues to be addressed in a business risk and operating cost analysis enabling application of the classification of the data centre;
    f) provides a reference to the operation and management of data centres.
    The following topics are outside of the scope of the ISO/IEC 22237 series:
    1)    the selection of information technology and network telecommunications equipment, software and associated configuration issues are outside the scope of this International Standard;
    2)    quantitative analysis of overall service availability resulting from multi-site data centres;
    3)    safety and electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) requirements (covered by other standards and regulations. However, information given in this document can be of assistance in meeting these standards and regulations).
