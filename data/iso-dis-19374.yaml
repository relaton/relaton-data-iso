abstract:
- content: '1.1 This document establishes a designation system of recycled carbon
    fibres, which may be used as the basis for specification. 1.2 This designation
    system is applicable to recycled carbon fibres used in polymer composites. 1.3
    The types of recycled carbon fibres are differentiated by a designation system
    based on appropriate levels of the designatory properties: a) tensile modulus
    of elasticity. b) tensile strength. c) fibre length 1.4 It is not intended to
    imply that recycled carbon fibres having the same designation will give the same
    performance. This document does not provide engineering data or data on processing
    conditions which may be required to specify a material for a particular and/or
    method of processing. 1.5 In order to specify recycled carbon fibres for a particular
    application, additional requirements may be given in optional data block 5.'
