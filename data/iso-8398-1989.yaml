abstract:
- content: The method is suitable for free flowing materials for measuring angles
    greater than 20 , but not for those which contain a large proportion of particles
    exceeding 5 mm in diameter.It consists in measuring of the height and diameter
    of the base of the cone, obtained by allowing a sample to fall through a fixed
    distance from a defined funnel onto a horizontal baseplate.
