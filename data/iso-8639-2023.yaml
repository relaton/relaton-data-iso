    This document specifies test methods for flexible non-thrust resistant socket-and-spigot joints with elastomeric sealing elements for buried and aboveground glass-reinforced thermosetting plastics (GRP) pipeline applications. It covers methods of test for the leaktightness and resistance to damage of the joint only, when subject to specified combinations of longitudinal extension (draw), angular movement (angular deflection), compression (deformation) perpendicular to the pipe axis and internal pressure. This document is applicable to joints for either pressure or non-pressure applications.
    NOTE       The joints tested in accordance with this document are subjected to conditions which measure their ability to function and thereby prove the design of the joint, especially for type test purposes.
    These test procedures are applicable to joints for pipes and fittings of all nominal sizes. The tests are suitable for the evaluation of joints intended for applications in which the liquids are conveyed at temperatures specified in the referring standards.
    The test procedures in this document are damaging to the test piece which will not be suitable for reuse after these tests. The test procedure is intended for type testing purposes.
