abstract:
- content: "ISO 10109-8:2005 is applicable to optical instruments and instruments
    with optical assemblies in extreme conditions of use. \nIt specifies requirements
    to be met with regard to the resistance of the optical, mechanical, chemical and
    electrical properties or performance data of instruments to environmental influences
    and hence determines geographical and technical areas of application. Environmental
    test methods as specified in ISO 9022 (all parts) are assigned to the various
    areas of application for the purpose of ascertaining the suitability of the instruments
    in their respective area of application.\nISO 10109-8:2005 is the basis for the
    specification of environmental requirements and environmental tests in instrument
    standards. If necessary, these requirements and tests can be amended in the instrument
    standards.\nISO 10109-8:2005 does not deal with the requirements to be met by
    the packaging of the instrument during transport from the manufacturer to the
    user."
