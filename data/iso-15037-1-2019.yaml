    This document specifies the general conditions that apply when vehicle dynamics properties are determined according to ISO test methods.
    In particular, it specifies general conditions for:
    —          variables;
    —          measuring equipment and data processing;
    —          environment (test track and wind velocity);
    —          test vehicle preparation (tuning and loading);
    —          initial driving; and
    —          test reports (general data and test conditions).
    These items are of general significance, regardless of the specific vehicle dynamics test method. They apply when vehicle dynamics properties are determined, unless other conditions are required by the standard which is actually used for the test method.
    This document is applicable to passenger cars as defined in ISO 3833 and light trucks.
    NOTE       The general conditions defined in existing vehicle dynamics standards are valid until a reference to this document is included.
    This document is cited in many other standards without a dated reference. In the course of its revision, no change in the numbering of clauses, tables and figures is anticipated.
