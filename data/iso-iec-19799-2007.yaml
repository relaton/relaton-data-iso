abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 19799:2007 defines methods and processes for measuring objective
    print quality attributes for the assessment of gloss non-uniformity on printed
    pages in reflection mode, and provides transforms, when applicable, that relate
    the objective results to subjective responses if appropriate. The gloss uniformity
    attributes included in ISO/IEC 19799:2007 are differential gloss, gloss uniformity
    within a page, and gloss consistency within a run. \nISO/IEC 19799:2007 provides\n-
    a definition of gloss uniformity attributes representative of the print quality
    on reflection prints, \n- a set of print files for the creation of printed pages
    for gloss uniformity measurement, \n- a procedure for gloss uniformity testing
    and the analysis of the resulting data, \n- a method for evaluating and grading
    these measurements and deriving an assessment of gloss uniformity, \n- the appropriate
    method of describing the gloss uniformity of printing and copying systems in documentation
    supplied to the consumer by the manufacturer. \nThe reflection prints that are
    to be used for measurement can be created via printers or copiers (analog and
    digital).\nISO/IEC 19799:2007 is applicable only to electro-photographic based
    prints. It does not address the measurement of gloss attributes of printed pages
    in transmission mode."
