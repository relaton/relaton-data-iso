  content: These specifications specify the characteristic properties of anodic oxide
    coatings, methods of test for checking the properties, minimum performance requirements,
    information on the grades of aluminium suitable for anodizing and the importance
    of pretreatment. ISO 7599 is applicable to coatings, which are formed on aluminium
    by an electrolytic oxidation process in which the aluminium acts as the anode.
    It does not apply to non-porous barrier layers, "hard anodized" coatings, and
    intermediate coatings.
