    ISO 26142:2010 defines the performance requirements and test methods of hydrogen detection apparatus that is designed to measure and monitor hydrogen concentrations in stationary applications. The provisions in ISO 26142:2010 cover the hydrogen detection apparatus used to achieve the single and/or multilevel safety operations, such as nitrogen purging or ventilation and/or system shut-off corresponding to the hydrogen concentration. The requirements applicable to the overall safety system, as well as the installation requirements of such apparatus, are excluded. ISO 26142:2010 sets out only the requirements applicable to a product standard for hydrogen detection apparatus, such as precision, response time, stability, measuring range, selectivity and poisoning.
    ISO 26142:2010 is intended to be used for certification purposes.
