    Consistent with Guideline A.3.2b and B.4 of the UN COPUOS LTS Guidelines [1] to “address the safety and reliability of outer space activities under the entity’s control, during all phases of a mission life cycle;” and to “perform conjunction assessment during all orbital phases of controlled flight,” this proposed standard describes the workflow and technical requirements for perceiving, evaluating, and avoiding collisions among orbiting objects, data requirements for these tasks, identifies techniques that can be used to estimate the probability and/or consequence of collision, and provides guidance and requirements for executing collision avoidance maneuvers.
