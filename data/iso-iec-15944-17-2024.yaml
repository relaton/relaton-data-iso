abstract:
- content: "This document:\na)       focuses on PbD aspects of privacy protection
    requirements as external constraints on any type of Person, (e.g. organization
    or public administration) involved in any kind of business transaction among such
    Persons which involves the electronic data interchange (EDI) of any personal information;\nb)      
    establishes a fundamental set of privacy principles known as Privacy by Design
    and assumptions based on primary sources;\nc)        integrates existing normative
    elements in support of PbD as are already identified in ISO/IEC 14662 and ISO/IEC 15944-1,
    ISO/IEC 15944-5, ISO/IEC 15944-8, ISO 15944-12;\nd)       provides overarching
    operational ‘best practice’ statements for associated (and not necessarily automated)
    processes, procedures, practices and governance requirements that need to act
    in support of implementing and enforcing technical mechanisms that support PbD
    in Open-edi transaction and collaboration space environments;\ne)       focuses
    on PbD related aspects of the life cycle management of and accountability for
    the personal information, i.e. the contents of SPIs (and their SRIs) related to
    the business transaction interchanged via EDI as information bundles and their
    associated semantic components among the parties to a business transaction. \nThis
    document focuses on the BOV aspects of a business transaction and does not concern
    itself with the technical mechanisms needed to implement the FSV aspects of the
    business requirements of the FSV including the specification of requirements of
    an FSV nature which include security techniques and services, communication protocols,
    etc.). The FSV includes any existing standard (or standards development of an
    FSV nature), which has been ratified by existing ISO, IEC, UN/ECE and/or ITU standards.
    \nThis document does not specify the technical mechanisms, i.e. FSV which are
    required to support BOV-identified requirements. Detailed exclusions to the scope
    of this document are provided in Annex D."
