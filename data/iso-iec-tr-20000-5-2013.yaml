abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC TR 20000-5:2013 is an exemplar implementation plan providing guidance
    on how to implement a service management system (SMS) to fulfil the requirements
    of ISO/IEC 20000-1:2011. The intended users of ISO/IEC TR 20000-5:2013 are service
    providers, but it can also be useful for those advising service providers on how
    to implement an SMS.\nISO/IEC TR 20000-5:2013 includes advice for service providers
    on a suitable order in which to plan, implement and improve an SMS using, as an
    example, a generic three-phased approach to manage the implementation. The service
    provider can choose their own sequence to implement the SMS. Also included is
    advice on the development of a business case, the project initiation and other
    activities that are recommended for the implementation to be successful.\nThe
    phases described in ISO/IEC TR 20000-5:2013 do not include changes to the intended
    scope of the service provider's SMS. The scope itself is not subject to phased
    changes as a result of adopting the advice in ISO/IEC TR 20000-5:2013. Instead,
    each phase should improve the SMS in alignment with the service provider's agreed
    scope, building on the results of the previous phase.\nThe main activities for
    the development of the business case and initiation of the implementation project
    are shown. The main activities to implement the SMS based on ISO/IEC 20000-1:2011,
    in three phases, are listed. Many of the activities described in ISO/IEC TR 20000-5:2013
    are intended to be met by actions over more than one phase, with each phase building
    upon the achievements of the earlier phase. Once the final phase is completed,
    the service provider's organization can achieve the benefits of an SMS that meets
    the requirements in ISO/IEC 20000-1:2011. Supporting information for the SMS implementation
    project is also provided.\nExamples of policies to illustrate what a service provider
    can want to put in place are provided. Because policies depend on the organization
    and the strategy of the service provider, these example policies can be tailored
    to suit the organizational requirement.\nGuidance on documentation management
    is provided, and templates are included for some of the documents specified in
    ISO/IEC 20000-1:2011 that can be amended to suit individual circumstances. "
