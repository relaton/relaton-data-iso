    This document provides the principles that govern the development of incident type and/or hazard specific test methods and minimum performance requirements for helmets for firefighters while engaged in specific rescue activities.
    Helmets related to specific rescue activities, such as road traffic crash (RTC) and urban search and rescue (USAR), are documented in individual subclauses of this document.
    NOTE       Further guidance can be found in ISO 18639-1.
    The purpose of this document is to ensure that minimum performance requirements for incident type and/or hazard specific helmets are designated.
    This document covers general helmet design, the minimum performance level of the materials used and the methods of test for determining this performance level.
    It does not cover special helmets for use in other high risk situations such as firefighting.
    This document does not cover protection for the torso, arms, legs and feet or protection of the hands against other hazards, e.g. chemical, biological, radiation and electrical hazards, except for limited, accidental exposure to fire ground chemicals and contaminated blood or body fluids.
    Selection of the appropriate system of personal protective equipment, (PPE), including helmets, is dependent on carrying out an effective risk assessment which identifies the hazard to be faced, evaluates the likelihood of those hazards and provides the means of reducing or eliminating these hazards.
