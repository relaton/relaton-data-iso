abstract:
- content: "This document provides the guidelines, minimum requirements and performance
    characteristics intended to guarantee that manufactured systems intended for on-site/field
    use (i.e. outside the laboratory) provide reliable and reproducible results.\nThis
    document specifies the requirements for technologies that enable on-site detection
    and quantification of Legionella spp. and L. pneumophila using a quantitative
    polymerase chain reaction assay (qPCR). It specifies general methodological requirements,
    performance evaluation requirements and quality control requirements. This document
    is intended to be used by manufacturers of these technologies so that they produce
    detection systems that end users can operate safely and effectively. End users
    will be guided by this document to adhere to manufacturer’s instructions, to ensure
    user competency and to perform the necessary controls.\nTechnical details specified
    in this document are given for information only. Any other technical solutions
    complying with the performance requirements are suitable.\nNOTE          For validation
    and performance requirements, see Clause 9.\nThis document is intended to be applied
    in the bacteriological investigation of all types of water (hot or cold water,
    cooling tower water, etc.), unless the nature and/or content of suspended matter
    and/or background microorganisms interfere with the determination. This interference
    can result in an adverse effect on both the detection limit and the quantification
    limit.\nThe results are expressed as the number of genome units of Legionella
    spp. and/or L. pneumophila per millilitre (or litre) of sample.\nAlthough the
    method described in this document is applicable to all types of water, some additives,
    such as chemicals used for water treatment, can interfere with and/or affect the
    sensitivity of the method.\nThe qPCR methods do not give any information about
    the physiological state of the Legionella. However, there are on-site qPCR methodologies
    which are able to distinguish intact bacteria from free DNA. "
