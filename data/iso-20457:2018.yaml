- content: |-
    This document specifies possible manufacturing tolerances for plastic moulded parts.
    This document specifies all integral features with general tolerances with surface profile tolerance within a specified datum system. It allows for additional specifications in case of functional needs and requirements using the ISO-GPS-tools for dimensional and geometrical tolerating.
    This document addresses injection moulding, injection compression moulding, transfer moulding, compression moulding and rotational moulding of non-porous moulded parts made from thermoplastics, thermoplastic elastomers and thermosets of thermoplastics. This document is applicable to other plastic processes if agreed to by the contractual parties.
    Moulded part surface imperfections such as sink marks, undesired flow structures and roughness, as well as joint lines are not addressed in this document.
    This document is not intended to supplant, replace or in any way interfere with requirements for tolerances found in product standards.
