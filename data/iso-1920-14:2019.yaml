    This document covers the method for determining the setting time of concrete with slump greater than zero, by testing mortar sieved from the concrete mixture. The initial setting time and the final setting time are the time intervals required for the mortar sieved from the concrete mixture to reach the specified values of penetration resistance after the initial contact of cement and water.
    The method can be used for determining the effect of variables such as temperature, type and content of cement, concrete mix proportions and admixtures, on the time of setting and hardening characteristics of concrete.
    This test method is applicable under controlled laboratory conditions, as well as under field conditions.
