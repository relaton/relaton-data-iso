  content: |-
    ISO 362-1:2007 specifies an engineering method for measuring the noise emitted by road vehicles of categories M and N under typical urban traffic conditions. It excludes vehicles of category L1 and L2, which are covered by ISO 9645, and vehicles of category L3, L4 and L5 covered by ISO 362-2.
    The specifications are intended to reproduce the level of noise generated by the principal noise sources during normal driving in urban traffic.
    The method is designed to meet the requirements of simplicity as far as they are consistent with reproducibility of results under the operating conditions of the vehicle.
    The test method requires an acoustical environment that is only obtained in an extensive open space. Such conditions are usually provided for type approval measurements of a vehicle, measurements at the manufacturing stage, and measurements at official testing stations.
