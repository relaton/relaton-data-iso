    signs are also defined for use as superscripts and subscripts. The system is founded
    on characters of the Latin and Greek alphabets, Arabic figures and other signs,
    e.g. points, commas, horizontal lines or asterisks. For the purpose of international
    applicability, all symbols have been derived from English words. The present classification
    may be used in calculations and technological and geometrical determinations as
    well as in the quality assurance of plain bearings.
