    This document specifies the dimensions of the clamped-type quick-release couplings used in vacuum technology, as well as those of the O-rings and their carriers associated with these couplings, used to ensure vacuum tightness.
    NOTE    The dimensions retained for the coupling diameter ensure the compatibility of the quick-release coupling with the corresponding vacuum flanges specified in ISO 1609[1].
