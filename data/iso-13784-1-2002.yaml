  content: 'ISO 13874-1:2002 specifies a test method for determining the reaction
    to fire of sandwich panel building systems for small rooms and the resulting flame
    spread on or within the sandwich panel building construction when it is exposed
    to heat from a simulated internal fire with flames impinging directly on its internal
    corner. The test method is not intended for evaluating a product''s fire resistance.
    ISO 13874-1:2002 is applicable to both freestanding and self-supporting, and frame-supported,
    sandwich panel systems. It is not applicable to sandwich panel products that are
    glued, nailed, bonded or similarly supported by an underlying wall or ceiling
    construction. '
