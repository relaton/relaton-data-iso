abstract:
- content: ISO 12877:2011 specifies the information to be recorded in farmed finfish
    supply chains in order to establish the traceability of products originating from
    farmed finfish. It specifies how traded fishery products are to be identified,
    and the information to be generated and held on those products by each of the
    food businesses that physically trade them through the distribution chains. It
    is specific to the distribution for human consumption of farmed finfish and their
    products, from finfish meal, breeding and finfish farming through to retailers
    or caterers.
