    This document specifies procedures for the absorption measurement and high spatial-resolution two-dimensional or three-dimensional absorption mapping of optical laser components, and upon calibration, the measurement of absolute absorptance of laser optics.
    The methods given in this document are intended to be used for the two-dimensional or three-dimensional absorption mapping of optical laser components, that is, measurement of absorption as a function of position, as well as absorption/absorptance measurement and mapping of laser optics used in high-power/high-energy laser systems.
