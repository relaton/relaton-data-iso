abstract:
- content: "This International Standard provides guidance on the determination of
    total fat content in milk and milk products, such as milk, cream, yogurt, ice
    cream, processed cheese, cheese, and milk powders, by the low-resolution nuclear
    magnetic resonance (NMR) using CPMG (Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill) Pulse sequence
    to optimize the specific response of fat molecules. \n\nThe described guidance
    is applicable to the analysis of any milk and milk products, regardless of source
    (species or region). It is applicable to dry samples (i.e. moisture ≤ 10 %) and
    liquid or wet samples which have been pre-dried such that all appreciable water
    has been removed. The NMR with CPMG Pulse Sequence analyses glycerolipids, which
    produces fat results comparable to the total fat result of standard fat extraction
    techniques, without the need for matrix specific calibrations while meeting the
    precision criteria listed in guideline. \nThe application is not limited by sample
    viscosity, colour, or particle size."
