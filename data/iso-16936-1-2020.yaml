    This document specifies requirements and a test method for security glazing designed to resist impacts of a hard body by delaying access of objects and/or persons to a protected space for a short period of time. It also classifies security-glazing products into categories of resistance to repetitive impacts of a steel sphere.
    In this document, the categories of resistance have not been assigned to special applications. It is intended that the glazing classification be specified on an individual basis for every application and anticipated action of force upon the glazing.
    This document deals with mechanical resistance to impact only.
    NOTE    Other properties can also be important.
