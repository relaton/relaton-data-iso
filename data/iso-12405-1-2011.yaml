    ISO 12405-1:2011 specifies test procedures for lithium-ion battery packs and systems for use in electrically propelled road vehicles.
    The specified test procedures enable the determination of the essential characteristics of performance, reliability and abuse of lithium-ion battery packs and systems. They assist the user of ISO 12405-1:2011 to compare the test results achieved for different battery packs or systems.
    Therefore, ISO 12405-1:2011 specifies standard test procedures for basic characteristics of performance, reliability and abuse of lithium-ion battery packs and systems.
    It enables the setting up of a dedicated test plan for an individual battery pack or system subject to agreement between the customer and supplier. If required, the relevant test procedures and/or test conditions of lithium-ion battery packs and systems can be selected from the standard tests provided in ISO 12405-1:2011 to configure a dedicated test plan.
    ISO 12405-1:2011 specifies tests for high-power battery packs and systems.
