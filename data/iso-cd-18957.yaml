abstract:
- content: "This document specifies a test method for determination of the aerobic
    biodegradation of plastic materials exposed in seawater using accelerated conditions
    in laboratory. \nThis document specifies the general requirements of the apparatus,
    and the procedures for using the test methods described. Biodegradation is determined
    by measuring oxygen demand in a closed respirometer or CO2 evolved from plastic
    materials when exposed to seawater.\nThis test method is designed to give an early
    indication of the potential biodegradability of plastic materials. \nIn addition,
    a method for analyzing resin-derived organic components in the test flask is further
    described as a determination method of the aerobic biodegradation of plastic materials
    instead of O2 and/or CO2 analysis.\nThis document is not suitable for the assessment
    of disintegration caused by heat or light exposure."
