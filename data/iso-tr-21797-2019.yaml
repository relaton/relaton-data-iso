  content: This document gives an overview of existing and currently used financial
    instrument identifiers. It shows which instrument identifiers, ticker symbols
    and proprietary codes are assigned via a standardized scheme to instruments of
    all asset classes. It focuses on providing an overview of the landscape and not
    on evaluating the schemes. Several aspects of the detailed trade cycle (a few
    examples being book building/primary, order entry management, execution management
    and trade confirmation matching) are excluded as their complexity would reduce
    the readability of the overview. Similarly, the level of complexity involved in
    properly representing the shifting perspectives of what is considered a financial
    instrument, based on a particular function being performed, is excluded.
