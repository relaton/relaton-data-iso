  content: Comparison of a variance with a given value, estimation of a variance,
    comparison of two variances, estimation of the ratio of two variances, and the
    same procedures for a mean with known or unknown variance are dealt with. Techniques
    are valid for sample elements drawn at random and being independent, when the
    distribution of the observed variable is normal, for a sample size not too small
    (5 to 10 at least) approximately also when the distribution does not deviate very
    much from the normal. Techniques of verification of the hypothesis of normality
    are briefly dealt with in the examples.
