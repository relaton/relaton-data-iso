    ISO 16496:2016 recommends dimensions and specifies requirements and test methods for laboratory glassware manufactured from borosilicate glass 3.3 and provided with a vacuum jacket for thermal insulation. It covers Dewar vessels, vacuum-jacketed reaction vessels and vacuum-jacketed columns intended for laboratory use and laboratory related applications. Typical dimensions are given in Tables 1 to 5.
    ISO 16496:2016 does not apply to large scale production equipment and equipment operated with pressures of more than 0,1 bar above atmospheric pressure.
