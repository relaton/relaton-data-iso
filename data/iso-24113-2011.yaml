    ISO 24113:2011 defines the primary space debris mitigation requirements applicable to all elements of unmanned systems launched into, or passing through, near-Earth space, including launch vehicle orbital stages, operating spacecraft and any objects released as part of normal operations or disposal actions.
    The requirements contained in ISO 24113:2011 are intended to reduce the growth of space debris by ensuring that spacecraft and launch vehicle orbital stages are designed, operated and disposed of in a manner that prevents them from generating debris throughout their orbital lifetime.
    ISO 24113:2011 is the top-level standard in a family of standards addressing debris mitigation. It will be the main interface for the user, bridging between the primary debris mitigation requirements and the lower-level implementation standards that will ensure compliance.
    ISO 24113:2011 does not cover launch phase safety for which specific rules are defined elsewhere.
