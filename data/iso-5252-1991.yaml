abstract:
- content: Specifies the majority of tolerances on dimensions used by ISO/TC 5/SC
    1 in drawing up International Standards concerning steel tubes. Is intended for
    use as a basic document by all ISO technical committees concerned with the standardization
    of steel tubes. It cannot, therefore, be used as a standard for the definiton
    of a product. This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition (1977),
    the standardized tolerances on thickness of which have been technically revised.
