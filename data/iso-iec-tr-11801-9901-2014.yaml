- content: "ISO/IEC TR 11801:2014(E) covers the following channel descriptions constructed
    from components with a nominal impedance of 100:  \n- Class I: 30 m channel based
    on upcoming Category 8.1 components. This channel provides increased margin compared
    to ISO/IEC 11801, Class EA channels, and an upper frequency limit of 1 600 MHz
    (2 000 MHz (ffs);                                                   \n- Class
    II: 30 m channel based on upcoming Category 8.2 components. This channel provides
    increased margin compared to ISO/IEC 11801, Class FA channels, and an upper frequency
    limit of 1 600 MHz (2 000 MHz ffs);                                                    \n-
