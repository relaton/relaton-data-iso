  content: Applicable to products the F content of which is equal to or more than
    0.5 mg/kg. Specifies the separation of the element from a test portion by steam
    distillation in a phosphoric acid medium. Formation of a blue-coloured complex
    with a combined reagent alizarin complexone/lanthanum nitrate in a buffered medium
    at the pH of 4.6. Addition of acetone to increase the stability of the complex
    and the sensitivity. Photometric measurement of the complex at a wavelength of
    about 600 nm.
