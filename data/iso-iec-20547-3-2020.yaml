    This document specifies the big data reference architecture (BDRA). The reference architecture includes concepts and architectural views.
    The reference architecture specified in this document defines two architectural viewpoints:
    —     a user view defining roles/sub-roles, their relationships, and types of activities within a big data ecosystem;
    —     a functional view defining the architectural layers and the classes of functional components within those layers that implement the activities of the roles/sub-roles within the user view.
    The BDRA is intended to:
    —     provide a common language for the various stakeholders;
    —     encourage adherence to common standards, specifications, and patterns;
    —     provide consistency of implementation of technology to solve similar problem sets;
    —     facilitate the understanding of the operational intricacies in big data;
    —     illustrate and understand the various big data components, processes, and systems, in the context of an overall big data conceptual model;
    —     provide a technical reference for government departments, agencies and other consumers to understand, discuss, categorize and compare big data solutions; and
    —     facilitate the analysis of candidate standards for interoperability, portability, reusability, and extendibility.
