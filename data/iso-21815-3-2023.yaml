abstract:
- content: |-
    This document defines requirements for collision warning systems (CWS) and collision avoidance systems (CAS) that address forward and reverse motion for:
    —     earth-moving machinery as defined in ISO 6165,
    —     mobile underground mining machinery as defined in ISO 19296, and
    —     road construction machinery as defined in ISO 22242.
    This document does not consider machine height beyond that of height in travel position (e.g. dump body on dumper in lowered position) as established by machine manufacturer.
    This document covers collision avoidance by reducing speed, stopping, or inhibiting motion; it does not cover avoidance by automatic manoeuvring (e.g. steering) away from the intended object. Specific requirements for other types of machine motion are defined in the other parts of the ISO 21815 series.
    The system described in this document is intended to assist the operator of the machine. The responsibility for safe operation of the machine remains with the machine operator.
    This document is not applicable to collision warning and collision avoidance systems installed/manufactured before the date of its publication.
