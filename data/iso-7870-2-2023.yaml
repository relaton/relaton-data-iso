    This document establishes a guide to the use and understanding of Shewhart control chart approach to the methods for statistical control of a process.
    This document is limited to the treatment of statistical process control methods using only Shewhart system of charts. Some supplementary material that is consistent with Shewhart approach, such as the use of warning limits, analysis of trend patterns and process capability is briefly introduced. However, there are several other types of control charts which can be used in different situations.
