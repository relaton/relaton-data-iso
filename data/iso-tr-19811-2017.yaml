    ISO/TR 19811:2017 covers composite cylinders and tubes to be used under the International Regulation for Transport of dangerous Goods by sea, air and land:
    -      with a water capacity up to 3000 l;
    -      with a design life greater than 15 years.
    ISO/TR 19811:2017 provides:
    -      information on existing service life test programmes from ISO/TC 58/SC 3 member countries;
    -      comments (initially for internal committee use only) on similarities and differences;
    -      recommendations on the feasibility of harmonization and whether it would be appropriate to develop an ISO deliverable.
