    This part of ISO 16145 specifies a method of protective coatings and its inspection for dedicated seawater ballast tanks. It is applicable to all types of ships of not less than 500 gross tonnage and double-side skin spaces of bulk carriers of 150 m in length and upwards, which are contracted for new building on or after 1 July 2008; or in the absence of a building contract, the keels of which are laid or which are at a similar stage of construction on or after 1 January 2009; or the delivery of which is on or after 1 July 2012.
    This part of ISO 16145 also is applicable to the dedicated seawater ballast tanks of oil tankers of double hull construction of 150 m in length and upwards and double-side skin spaces of bulk carriers of 90 m in length and upwards, which are contracted for new building on or after 8 December 2006.
    NOTE   Double-side skin space is a configuration where each ship side is constructed by the side shell with a longitudinal bulkhead connecting to the double bottom and the deck. Hopper side tanks and top-side tanks may, where fitted, be integral parts of the double-side skin configuration. Therefore, the void spaces or other designated tanks arranged as a part of top-side tank, when provided in the bulk carriers of single-side skin construction, need not be considered as a double-side skin space
