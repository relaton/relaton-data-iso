  content: "ISO/IEC 15459-4:2014 specifies a unique string of characters for the identification
    of individual products and product packages. The character string is intended
    to be represented in a linear bar code symbol or two-dimensional symbol or other
    automatic identification and data capture (AIDC) media attached to the entity
    to meet management needs. To address management needs, different classes of identities
    are recognized in the various parts of ISO/IEC 15459, which allows different requirements
    to be met by the identities associated with each class. \nThe rules for the identification
    of an individual occurrence of a product or product package, understood to mean
    the layers zero and one defined in ISO 17367 and ISO 17366, respectively, are
    defined and supported by examples."
