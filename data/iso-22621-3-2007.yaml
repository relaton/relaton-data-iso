abstract:
- content: "ISO 22621 specifies the physical and mechanical properties of fittings
    made from polyamide (PA) in accordance with ISO 22621-1, intended to be buried
    and used for the supply of gaseous fuels at maximum operating pressures (MOP)
    up to and including 2 MPa (20 bar). \nIt also specifies the test parameters for
    the test methods to which it refers.\nIn addition, it lays down dimensional characteristics
    and requirements for the marking of fittings.\nIn conjunction with the other parts
    of ISO 22621, it is applicable to PA fittings, their joints, to joints with components
    of PA and to joints with mechanical fittings of other materials, and to the following
    fitting types: fusion fittings (electrofusion and butt fusion fittings); transition
    fittings."
