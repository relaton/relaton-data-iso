  content: Specifies a test method under steady-state conditions when water flows
    through the valves. Also describes the method of reporting pertinent test data.
    The valve performance specifications presented are of such scope and accuracy
    as to assist irrigation system designers when comparing pressure losses through
    various types of irrigation valves. The measurement of pressure losses provides
    a means for determining the relationship between pressure loss and flow-rate through
    the valve.
