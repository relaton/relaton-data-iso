    This document specifies assessment indicators to support the assessment of organizational process maturity for data quality management in the context of manufacturing operations management as specified by IEC 62264‑1.
    The following are within scope of this document:
    —    assessment indicators that are work products generated by data processing (as specified by ISO 8000‑61) and, thus, enable rating of process performance, a process attribute specified by ISO/IEC 33020;
    —    the role played by each work product in the processes of manufacturing operations management;
    —    the connection of each work product to the outcomes of the processes of manufacturing operations management.
    The following are outside the scope of this document:
    —    assessment indicators for any of the other process attributes specified by ISO/IEC 33020;
    —    methods or procedures to measure process capability.
