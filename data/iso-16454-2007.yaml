    ISO 16454:2007 is intended to be used for the determination of the stress/strain distribution and margins of safety in launch vehicles and spacecraft primary structure design. Liquid propellant engine structures, solid propellant engine nozzles and the solid propellant itself are not covered, but liquid propellant tanks, pressure vessels and solid propellant cases are within the scope of ISO 16454:2007.
    ISO 16454:2007 provides requirements for the determination of maximum stress and corresponding margin of safety under loading, and defines criteria for static strength failure modes, such as rupture, collapse and detrimental yielding. Critical conditions associated with fatigue, creep and crack growths are not covered. Notwithstanding these limitations in scope, the results of stress calculations based on the requirements of ISO 16454:2007 are applicable to other critical condition analyses.
    In accordance with the requirements of ISO 16454:2007, models, methods and procedures for stress determination can also be applied to the displacements and deformation calculations, as well as to the loads definition, applied to substructures and structural members of structures under consideration. When ISO 16454:2007 is applied, it is assumed that temperature distribution has been determined and is used as input data.
