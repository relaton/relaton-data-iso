  content: ISO 27727:2008 specifies a method for the determination of the fatigue
    crack growth rate of vulcanized rubber under repeated loading over an extended
    period of time. The crack starts from the tip of a cut made in the test piece
    before the test, and grows progressively until it finally becomes large enough
    for complete fracture to occur. Using a pure-shear test piece, measurements are
    made to monitor the crack growth under the cyclic loading in order to obtain the
    crack growth rate, i.e. the increase in crack length per cycle. Tests are carried
    out at various tearing energies by varying the strain energy density in the test
    piece. This is done by changing the strain amplitude.
