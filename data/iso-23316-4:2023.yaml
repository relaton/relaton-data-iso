    This document specifies required measures applicable to the HPI AC Interface between a supply system (typically located on an agricultural tractor) and detachable electrical consumer system (typically located on an agricultural implement).
    This document covers the following:
    —     HPI system topologies;
    —     interface relevant characteristics of the HPI providing AC or combined AC and DC;
    —     interface relevant characteristics of the HPI AC load (for relevant characteristics of a DC load, see ISO 23316‑5);
    —     logical, operational and electrical characteristics of the HPI:
    —     operating mode aspects, and
    —     communication parameters
    NOTE            This document contains simplified electrical diagrams showing specific aspects of the required functionality.
