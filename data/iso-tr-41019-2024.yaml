    This document provides a broad societal context for facility management (FM) to inspire organizations that wish to:
    —     establish and improve a sustainable integrated FM system;
    —     embrace the wide-ranging and positive contribution that FM makes in managing the built environment;
    —     support the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
    This document provides a non-exhaustive contextual introduction to relevant concepts, initiatives and terms that are in common use.
    It is acknowledged that the practice of FM internationally is dynamic and diverse, hence this document provides generic information based on current experience without setting out any specific requirements, recommendations or permissions. Organizations are encouraged to make their own enquiries as to the extent this document is applicable to their circumstances.
