    This document provides a broad societal context for facility management (FM) to inspire organizations that wish to:
    —     establish and improve a sustainable integrated FM system;
    —     embrace the wide-ranging and positive contribution that FM makes in managing the built environment;
    —     support the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
    This document provides a non-exhaustive contextual introduction to relevant concepts, initiatives and terms that are in common use.
