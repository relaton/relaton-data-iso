  script: Latn
  content: ISO 4138:2012 specifies open-loop test methods for determining the steady-state
    circular driving behaviour of passenger cars as defined in ISO 3833 and of light
    trucks, such behaviour being one of the factors comprising vehicle dynamics and
    road-holding properties. The open-loop manoeuvres included in these methods are
    not representative of real driving conditions, but are nevertheless useful for
    obtaining measures of vehicle steady-state behaviour resulting from several specific
    types of control inputs under closely controlled test conditions.
