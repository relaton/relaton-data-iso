  content: The principle of the method specified is complexing of the aluminium in
    the extract solution to be analyzed with chromazurol S, measuring the optical
    density of the resulting solution by means of a molecular absorption spectrometer
    at 545 nm using 10 mm optical cells. Measures the concentration of aluminium,
    expressed as its oxide Al2O3. Applies to the analysis of extract solutions obtained
    from any kind of glass or glassware including laboratory and pharmaceutical ware,
    food and drink packaging ware, tableware and kitchenware.
