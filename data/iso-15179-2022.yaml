    This document specifies the requirements for hot-rolled twin-roll cast steel sheet of structural quality and high strength steel.
    The product is intended for applications where specific mechanical properties are required. It is generally used in the delivered condition and is intended for bolted, riveted or welded structures, and it is produced on a wide strip mill, not a plate mill.
    Structural quality twin-roll cast steel sheet is a carbon steel produced to specified mechanical properties and is available in a number of grades.
    High strength hot-rolled twin-roll cast steel sheet, strengthened by microalloys is produced to specified mechanical properties and is available in a number of grades and classes.
