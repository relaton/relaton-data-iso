    ISO 15821:2007 specifies a test method for determining the water-tightness under dynamic pressure of doorsets and windows, assembled for normal use and installed as in practice.
    ISO 15821:2007 is applicable to areas subject to severe weather, e.g. that are heavily weather-beaten, stricken by driving rain and wind, including typhoons, hurricanes, cyclones and other severe climate.
    ISO 15821:2007 does not apply to the joints between the door or window frame and the building construction.
