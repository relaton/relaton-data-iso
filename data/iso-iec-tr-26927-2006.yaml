abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC TR 26927:2006 identifies key mobility issues for access to IP-based
    enterprise information and communications services. It defines a taxonomy of mobility
    terms and then explores use cases and connectivity scenarios involving mobile
    enterprise users. From these, it derives requirements for mobility management,
    architecture and security.\nMobility for enterprise communication is about making
    desktop communication and information resources available at different locations
    and while on the move. ISO/IEC TR 26927:2006 encompasses both wired and wireless
    connectivity using enterprise and public all-IP networks for voice, data and converged
    services. \nISO/IEC TR 26927:2006 is intended as an aid to analysing gaps in standardization
    that prevent or hinder mobility in enterprise communications and information access.
    More general interworking issues of enterprise communications are covered by a
    companion Technical Report, ISO/IEC TR 26905."
