abstract:
- content: |-
    This document defines test methods for determining the conformance of radio frequency identification devices (tags and interrogators) for item management with the specifications given in ISO/IEC 18000‑3. It does not apply to the testing of conformity with regulatory or similar requirements.
    The test methods intend to verify the mandatory functions, and any optional functions which are implemented. This can, in appropriate circumstances, be supplemented by further, application-specific functionality criteria that are not available in the general case.
    This document includes the following interrogator and tag conformance parameters:
    —    mode-specific conformance parameters including nominal values and tolerances;
    —    parameters that apply directly affecting system functionality and inter-operability.
    This document does not include the following:
    —    parameters that are already included in regulatory test requirements;
    —    high-level data encoding conformance test parameters (these are specified in ISO/IEC 15962).
