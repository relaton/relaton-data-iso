    This document applies to nuclear power plants with water cooled reactors.
    This document does not apply to earthquakes stronger than the design basis earthquake.
    This document specifies guidance on the actions to be taken in preparation for and following an earthquake at a nuclear power plant. This document is intended to be used as a guideline for decision making regarding continued operation, shutdown and restart of the nuclear power plant after an earthquake. It can also be used to assist operating organizations in the preparation and implementation of an overall pre- and post-earthquake action programme for dealing with situations in accordance with the level of seismic ground motion experienced at the site, and the seismic design level of the plant.
