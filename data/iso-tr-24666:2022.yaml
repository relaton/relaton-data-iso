- content: |-
    This document compiles a collection of different probes/gauges for assessing common playground equipment safety performance to eliminate known safety hazards such as: entrapment and entanglement hazards on playground, playspaces, and associated equipment used in different countries/regions around the world. It also explains some historical content of origins, the purpose and some rationales for the dimensions and shape of each of those probes.
    NOTE       These test probes and gauges, their dimensions and related historic rationale for their existence are of significant value to playground equipment, manufacturers, designers, installers, assemblers, owners, operators and inspectors alike and are necessary tools to the reduction of serious, life-threatening and debilitating injuries to the public playground intended users.
