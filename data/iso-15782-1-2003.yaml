  content: 'ISO 15782-1:2003 defines a certificate management system for financial
    industry use for legal and natural persons that includes credentials and certificate
    contents, certification authority systems (including certificates for digital
    signatures and encryption key management), certificate generation, distribution,
    validation and renewal, authentication structure and certification paths, revocation
    and recovery procedures, and extensions to the definitions of public-key certificates
    and certificate revocation lists. It also recommends some useful operational procedures
    (e.g. distribution mechanisms, acceptance criteria for submitted credentials).
    While providing for the generation of certificates that could include a public
    key used for encryption key management, it does not address the generation or
    transport of keys used for encryption. '
