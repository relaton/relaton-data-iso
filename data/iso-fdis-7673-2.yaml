  content: "This proposal is the third of three separate, but linked, proposals. The
    deliverable consists of documentation that defines the processes and models for
    data exchange in agricultural irrigation. The scope of the set of three proposals
    is based on two major irrigation data processes:\n\n1.\tObservations: The field,
    atmospheric, plant, or other in situ measurements that apply to irrigation management.
    This includes weather stations, soil moisture sensors, or crop-related sensing.
    This work is an agricultural implementation of the ISO 19156 standard for observations
    and measurements (ISO, 2011).\n2.\tOperations: All of the activities associated
    with the application of water with an irrigation system. This includes, but is
    not restricted to, management-level communications and record-keeping. The operations
    data set is based around a Recommendation, which describes a suggested course
    of action; a Work Order, which describes a desired course of action; and a Work
    Record, which describes what actually happened. This work is based on, and extends,
    the ISO11783-10 standard for communications between agricultural machinery and
    a Farm Management Information System (ISO, 2015).\n\nThe purpose of this particular
    part of the proposed standard is to present an object model and reference XML
    serialization schema to represent the specification and reporting of irrigation
    water and product applications in an irrigation system. The scope includes planning
    and preparation phases (represented by documents called Recommendation and Work
    Order) as well as the recording of as-applied water and products (known as a Work
    Record). The scope of this document does not, however, include representing the
    Observations and Measurements that drive tactical decision-making in irrigation
    (and the creation of Recommendations and Work Orders); that material, corresponding
    to an irrigation-specific implementation of the ISO 19156 standard, is covered
    in Part 2 of the proposed standard. This standard should enable a developer to
    unambiguously represent the data being communicated in various parts of the farmer's
    business process associated with irrigation field operations in terms of a set
    of classes based on the ISO 11783 standard.\nThe proposed standard is meant to
    support the exchange of data. The classes, data formats, and structures are not
    meant to indirectly specify internal structure or the object model of a Farm Management
    Information System (FMIS) or similar system.  \n\nThe proposed standard will not
    specify any type of “summary” report.  This is intentional.  The information contained
    in a collection of standard-compliant documents will be sufficient to create a
    summary of irrigation applications. Actual summarization of irrigation requires
    aggregation, and the method or scope of aggregation is often derived from specific
    reporting requirements. The proposed standard will be neutral with regard to reporting
    requirements because these requirements are typically derived from a regional,
    basin, or administrative unit scale and are, therefore, out of scope."
