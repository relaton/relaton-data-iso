- content: |-
    This document specifies the characteristics and requirements for a piping system and its components, made from unplasticized polyamide (PA-U) intended to be used for thermoplastics piping systems in industrial applications above and below ground.
    NOTE 1        Requirements applying to industrial valves are given in this document and in other standards.
    This document is applicable to PA-U pipes, fittings, valves and their joints, and to joints with components of other plastics and non-plastic materials, depending on their suitability, intended to be used for the conveyance of liquid and gaseous fluids as well as solid matter in fluids for industrial applications such as the following:
    —     transport of oil, gaseous fuels and multiphase mixtures (exploration and production; general purpose hydrocarbon-based fluids);
    —     transport of renewable gases (hydrogen, biomethane);
    —     transport of contaminated sewer (e.g. contaminated with hydrocarbons);
    —     transport of CO2 [carbon capture and utilisation or storage (CCUS)].
    NOTE 2        National regulations can apply.
    NOTE 3        Other application areas are possible if the requirements of this document and/or applicable national requirements are fulfilled.
    Characteristics and requirements which are applicable for PA-U are covered by the relevant clauses of this document. Those characteristics and requirements which are dependent on the material are given in the relevant normative Annex A.
