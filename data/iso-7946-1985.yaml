abstract:
- content: Specifies geometrical tests for slot mortising machines for general purpose
    use and normal accuracy, gives the corresponding permissible deviations and furthermore
    the nomenclature appropriate to each part of the machine in English and French,
    and the equivalent terms in German, Spanish, Italian, and Swedish. It deals only
