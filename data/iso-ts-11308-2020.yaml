    This document gives guidelines for the characterization of carbon nanotube (CNT)-containing samples by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), performed in either an inert or oxidizing environment. Guidance is provided on the purity assessment of the CNT samples through a quantitative measure of the types of carbon species present as well as the non-carbon impurities (e.g. metal catalyst particles) within the material.
    In addition, this technique provides a qualitative assessment of the thermal stability and homogeneity of the CNT-containing sample. Additional characterization techniques are required to confirm the presence of specific types of CNT and to verify the composition of the metallic impurities present.
