abstract:
- content: |-
    ISO/IEC 29169:2016 aims to define the application of a conformity assessment methodology, based on the existing published ISO/IEC standards and guides, to the process assessment of process quality characteristics and organizational process maturity, performed in accordance with the requirements of the ISO/IEC 33001 to ISO/IEC 33099 family of process assessment standards,
    Conformity assessment, also known as compliance assessment, is any activity to determine, directly or indirectly, that a process, product, or service meets relevant standards and fulfils relevant requirements. The subject of conformity assessment activities may include testing, inspection or certification.
    Conformity assessment in this International Standard can be performed by various types of bodies that meet the requirements of ISO/IEC 17020.
    The term "inspection" as used in ISO/IEC 17020 is synonymous with the term "process assessment" as defined in ISO/IEC 33001 and used throughout the ISO/IEC 33001 to ISO/IEC 33099 family of standards.
    While a process assessment may be performed solely according to the ISO/IEC 33002 requirements for performing an assessment, performing a process assessment in the context of conformity assessment according to a conformity assessment scheme brings with it additional requirements. Conformity assessment involves a functional approach consisting of a number of stages: selection?determination?review and attestation, plus surveillance when there is a need to provide continuing assurance of conformity.
