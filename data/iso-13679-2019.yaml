    This document specifies tests to perform in order to determine the galling tendency, sealing performance and structural integrity of casing and tubing connections. "Casing" and "tubing" apply to the service application and not to the diameter of the pipe.
    This document covers the testing of connections for the most commonly encountered well conditions. Not all possible service scenarios are included. For example, the presence of a corrosive fluid, which can influence the service performance of a connection, is not considered.
    This document supplements API RP 5C5:2017, the requirements of which are applicable with the exceptions specified in this document.
