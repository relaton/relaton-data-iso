- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: ISO 14900:2017 specifies two methods for the measurement of the hydroxyl
    number of polyols used as polyurethane raw materials. It is necessary to know
    the hydroxyl content of polyols to properly formulate polyurethane systems. Method
    A is primarily applicable to readily esterified polyether polyols. It is also
    intended for polyols which have significant steric hindrance, such as those based
    on sugars. Method B is intended for polyether polyols, polymer polyols and amine-initiated
    polyols, but may give low results for sterically hindered polyols. Other polyols
    can be analysed by these methods if precautions are taken to verify applicability.
    These methods can be used for research and for quality control and specification
    purposes.
