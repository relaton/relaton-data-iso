abstract:
- content: "This international standard (part 1 or part 2) specifies the method for
    measuring tread abrasion mass loss of a candidate tyre per unit distance travelled,
    under loaded conditions, by using vehicles on road (part 1) or an external drum
    tester (part 2).\nEach test method specified in Part 1 and Part 2 measures abrasion
    performance of a candidate tyre on the running mode representing vehicle driving
    conditions of the world. The test method specified by Part 1 and Part 2 uses reference
    tyres. \nThe target is to define methods with the following characteristics:\n-
    repeatable, \n- reproducible, \n- practicable,\n- representative of worldwide
    driving environment,\n- usable for regulation purpose (including market surveillance),\n-
    cost efficient,\n- aiming for having a correlation between the 2 test methods
    in line with driving conditions of the world,"
