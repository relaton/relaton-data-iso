    This document specifies digital code for mats and modulation methods for motion-picture film to be used for timing, control, editing and synchronization purposes. This document also specifies the relationship of the codes to the motion picture frame.
    Two types of code are described in this document. The first type, Type C, is a continuous code which is very similar to the continuous code specified in IEC 60461. This type of code can be used in situations where the film is moving continuously at the time of both recording and reproduction.
    The second type of code, Type 8, is a non-continuous, block-type code, composed of blocks of data, each complete in itself, with gaps between the blocks. It is designed so that the code can be recorded and played back on equipment with intermittent film motion but still be decoded with the same type of electronic equipment used to read the Type C or continuous time code.
