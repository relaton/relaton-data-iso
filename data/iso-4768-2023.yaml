    This document specifies a test method to evaluate the anti-biofilm activity of anti-biofilm treated plastics and other non-porous surfaces of products, including intermediate products. It is applicable to products such as plastics, coating materials, ceramics, stainless steels and rubber. Textile and photocatalytic materials are out of its scope.
    This method is intended to be a screening test for material development, and it is not expected to reflect effects observed in the actual environment in which materials will be deployed. A “Crystal violet staining – Absorbance measurement assay” is used to quantify the amount of biofilm formation in this document.
