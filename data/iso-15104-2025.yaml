    This document establishes requirements and guidance for the ground-based environmental testing of thermal control materials (TCMs) applied on spacecraft surface.
    This document describes the test methods for the following environmental conditions: charged particle radiation(s), solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation, atomic oxygen (AO) and thermal cycling.
    This document does not cover other environmental effects such as contamination effect of the Xenon ion engines plume (so called artificial effect) or the effects of neutron (see detailed information in Annex B).
    This document is applicable to typical TCM(s), including but not limited to, paint, silicate, film, anodic oxide, and glass (optical solar reflector, OSR). This document can be referenced for other materials, to which similar requirements apply. This document is devoted to material estimation or evaluation tests and can be tailored according to specific applications.
