- content: 'Provided to measure the resistance to leaching of the solidified materials:
    glass, glass-ceramics, ceramics, bitumen, cement, concrete, plastics, the test
    being aimed at the comparison of different kinds or compositions, intercomparison
    between test results from different laboratories on one product or on products
    of different processes. It is not required to carry out tests in all possible
    combinations of variables but one appropriate set of standard conditions should
    be met.'
