    ISO 7176-5:2007 specifies methods for the determination of wheelchair dimensions and mass.
    This includes specific methods for the determination of outside dimensions when the wheelchair is occupied by a reference occupant and the required manoeuvring space needed for wheelchair manoeuvres commonly carried out in daily life.
    ISO 7176-5:2007 specifies requirements for the disclosure of the dimensions and masses and contains five informative annexes.
    Annex A specifies methods for the determination of technical dimensions that can be important to the performance of the wheelchair.
    Annex B provides detailed information about pivot width and reversing width.
    Annex C provides detailed information about the turning diameter.
    Annex D provides details on determining the wheelchair longitudinal axis and wheelchair centre-point.
    Annex E provides technical guidelines and interpretation for many of the measurements specified to facilitate improved understanding, design and construction of wheelchairs.
    ISO 7176-5:2007 is applicable to manual wheelchairs and electrically powered wheelchairs (including scooters).
