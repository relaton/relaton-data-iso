  content: The sample is heated in an aluminium retort to a temperatur of 520 °C.
    The products of decomposition pass into a water-cooled receiver; the tar and water
    are condensed while gaseous products pass to atmosphere. The coke residue and
    the receiver and its contents are weighed. The mass of tar is obtained by difference
    to the mass of water determined by entrainment with toluene or xylene. A separate
    determination of moisture in the coal, also by entrainment with tulene or xylen,
    is amde so that the decomposition water can be calculated. The peecentage of gas
    is obtained by subtracting from 100 the sum of the percentages of coke residue,
    of tar and decomposition water.
