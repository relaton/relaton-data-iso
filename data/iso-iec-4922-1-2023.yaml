    This document specifies definitions, terminology and processes for secure multiparty computation and related technology, in order to establish a taxonomy and enable interoperability. In particular, this document defines the processes involved in cryptographic mechanisms which compute a function on data while the data are kept private; the participating parties; and the cryptographic properties.
    The terminology contained in this document is common to the ISO/IEC 4922 series.
