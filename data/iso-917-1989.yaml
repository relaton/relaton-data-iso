  content: The provisions are applicable to single-stage refrigerant compressors of
    the positive-displacement type only. Selected test methods are described for the
    determination of the refrigerating capacity, power, isentropric efficiency, and
    the coefficient of performance. The test methods described may also be used as
    a guide for testing other types of refrigerant compressors. - Replaces the first
    edition (ISO 917:1974) and constitutes its technical revision.
