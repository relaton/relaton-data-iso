  content: The proposal of this new work item is to develop the standard of "Quick-frozen
    coated aquatic products". The standard specifies the requirements for quick-frozen
    coated aquatic products and the test methods for quality control. It also specifies
    the requirements of packaging, marking, storage and transportation. The standard
    is applicable to quick-frozen aquatic products-breaded or in batter made from
    finfish, crustaceans, molluscan shellfish and cephalopods through pre-treatment,
    wet and dry coating, and quick freezing, which are raw or pre-cooked products.
