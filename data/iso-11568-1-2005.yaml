abstract:
- content: "ISO 11568-1:2005 specifies the principles for the management of keys used
    in cryptosystems implemented within the retail-banking environment. The retail-banking
    environment includes the interface between a card accepting device and an acquirer,
    an acquirer and a card issuer, an ICC and a card-accepting device. \nAn example
    of this environment and threats associated with the implementation of ISO 11568-1:2005
    in the retail-banking environment are also described.\nISO 11568-1:2005 is applicable
    both to the keys of symmetric cipher systems, where both originator and recipient
    use the same secret key(s), and to the private and public keys of asymmetric cryptosystems,
    unless otherwise stated. The procedure for the approval of cryptographic algorithms
    used for key management is specified.\nThe use of ciphers often involves control
    information other than keys, e.g. initialization vectors and key identifiers.
    This other information is collectively called \"keying material\". Although ISO
    11568-1:2005 specifically addresses the management of keys, the principles, services,
    and techniques applicable to keys may also be applicable to keying material.\nISO
    11568-1:2005 is appropriate for use by financial institutions and other organizations
    engaged in the area of retail financial services, where the interchange of information
    requires confidentiality, integrity, or authentication. Retail financial services
    include but are not limited to such processes as POS debit and credit authorizations,
    automated dispensing machine and ATM transactions, etc.\nISO 9564 and ISO 16609
    specify the use of cryptographic operations within retail financial transactions
    for personal identification number (PIN) encipherment and message authentication,
    respectively. The ISO 11568 series of standards is applicable to the management
    of the keys introduced by those standards. Additionally, the key management procedures
    may themselves require the introduction of further keys, e.g. key encipherment
    keys. The key management procedures are equally applicable to those keys."
