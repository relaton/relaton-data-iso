abstract:
- content: Specifies the method of Knoop hardness test covering test forces up to
    and including 9,807 N. The principle of the method is forcing a diamond indenter,
    in the form of a rhombic-based pyramid with specified angles between opposite
    faces at the vertex, into the surface of a test piece and measuring the long diagonal
    of the indentation left in the surface after removal of the test force. The Knoop
    hardness is proportional to the quotient obtained by dividing the test force by
    the projected area of the indentation.
