  content: "ISO 22307:2008 recognizes that a privacy impact assessment (PIA) is an
    important financial services and banking management tool to be used within an
    organization, or by “contracted” third parties, to identify and mitigate privacy
    issues and risks associated with processing consumer data using automated, networked
    information systems.\nISO 22307:2008\n-        describes the privacy impact assessment
    activity in general,\n-        defines the common and required components of a
    privacy impact assessment, regardless of business systems affecting financial
    institutions, and \n-        provides informative guidance to educate the reader
    on privacy impact assessments.\nA privacy compliance audit differs from a privacy
    impact assessment in that the compliance audit determines an institution's current
    level of compliance with the law and identifies steps to avoid future non-compliance
    with the law. While there are similarities between privacy impact assessments
    and privacy compliance audits in that they use some of the same skills and that
    they are tools used to avoid breaches of privacy, the primary concern of a compliance
    audit is simply to meet the requirements of the law, whereas a privacy impact
    assessment is intended to investigate further in order to identify ways to safeguard
    privacy optimally.\nISO 22307:2008 recognizes that the choices of financial and
    banking system development and risk management procedures are business decisions
    and, as such, the business decision makers need to be informed in order to be
    able to make informed decisions for their financial institutions. ISO 22307:2008
    provides a privacy impact assessment structure (common PIA components, definitions
    and informative annexes) for institutions handling financial information that
    wish to use a privacy impact assessment as a tool to plan for, and manage, privacy
    issues within business systems that they consider to be vulnerable."
