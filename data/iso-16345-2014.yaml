abstract:
- content: |-
    ISO 16345:2014 covers the measurement of the thermal performance and pumping head of open- and closed-circuit, mechanical draft, wet and wet/dry cooling towers and natural draft and fan-assisted natural draft, wet and wet/dry cooling towers. The standard rating boundaries for series mechanical draft, open- and closed-circuit cooling towers are specified.
    ISO 16345:2014 does not apply to the testing and rating of closed-circuit towers where the process fluid undergoes a change in phase as it passes through the heat exchanger or where the thermophysical properties of the process fluid are not available.
