    This document specifies requirements for the respiratory tubing and connectors used to convey
    respirable gases to a patient in the healthcare environment and provide a safe connection between the
    gas supply device and the patient interface. Respiratory tubing and connectors are mainly used for
    delivery of oxygen, but can also be used for respirable air or oxygen/air mixtures and breathable
    medicinal gas mixtures such as oxygen/nitrous oxide or oxygen/helium mixtures. This document also
    specifies requirements for respiratory therapy extension tubing.
