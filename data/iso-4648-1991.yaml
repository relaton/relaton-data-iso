  content: For the accurate determination of the various properties of rubber it is
    essential that the dimensions of the test pieces or products used be measured
    under well specified conditions. This second edition cancels and replaces the
    first edition (ISO 4648:1978), the scope of which has been extended to include
    thermoplastic rubbers. Specifies four methods which are selected according to
    the magnitude of the dimension to be measured and to the desired accuracy. For
    the control measurement, refer to ISO 3302.
