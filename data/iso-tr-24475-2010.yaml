    ISO/TR 24475:2010 is aimed at contributing to the training of personnel in cosmetic production plants within the context of the introduction of Good Manufacturing Practices.
    It is intended to complement personal involvement and reasoning in the implementation of ISO 22716.
    ISO/TR 24475:2010 covers the quality aspects of the cosmetic product, but does not take into account safety aspects for the personnel, nor does it cover aspects of protection of the environment or those concerning the safety and efficacy of the finished products.
    ISO/TR 24475:2010 cannot be used alone and needs as a prerequisite a good knowledge of ISO 22716 which is the reference document.
