    ISO/IEC TR 24729-1:2008 provides guidance on the use of radio frequency identification (RFID) enabled labels and packaging in the supply chain. Guidance is provided for transponder selection, as well as the selection of media, adhesives, facestocks, and inks. Techniques are described to minimize electrostatic discharge and transponder damage.
    Methods are described to verify transponder data. Placement and attachment guidance is provided for inlays, conveyable cases and containers, palletized/unit load material, as well as non-conveyables and non-palletized materials.
    One type of RFID referred to within ISO/IEC TR 24729-1:2008 is the EPCglobal Class 1 Generation 2 technology. The“Class” structure originally embraced by EPCglobal has, for the most part, been overtaken by events. Consequently, this technology may be referred to as UHF Gen 2 or by its ISO designation, ISO/IEC 18000,Part 6C.
