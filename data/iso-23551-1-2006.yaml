    ISO 23551-1:2006 specifies safety, constructional and performance requirements and testing of automatic valves (hereafter referred to as valves) for gas burners, gas appliances and similar use.
    ISO 23551-1:2006 covers type testing only.
    ISO 23551-1:2006 applies to valves with declared maximum working pressures up to and including 500 kPa, for use on burners or in appliances using fuel gases as natural gas, manufactured gas or liquefied petroleum gas (LPG).
    ISO 23551-1:20061 applies to valves directly or indirectly operated electrically or by mechanical means.
    ISO 23551-1:2006 applies to valves actuated by fluids e.g. pneumatic, hydraulic.
    ISO 23551-1:2006 applies to valves where the flow rate is controlled by external electrical signals, either in discrete steps or proportional to the applied signal.
    ISO 23551-1:2006 applies to valves fitted with closed position indicator switches.
