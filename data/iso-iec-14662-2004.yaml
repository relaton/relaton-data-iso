abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 14662:2004 specifies the framework for coordinating the integration
    of existing International Standards and the development of future International
    Standards for the inter-working of Open-edi Parties via Open-edi and provides
    a reference for those International Standards. As such, it serves to guide the
    work necessary to accomplish Open-edi by providing the context to be used by developers
    of International Standards to ensure the coherence and integration of related
    standardized modelling and descriptive techniques, services, service interfaces
    and protocols.\nThis International Standard describes, through two perspectives
    of business transactions, significant aspects relevant to the interoperability
    of information technology systems used by Open-edi Parties engaging in Open-edi.
    The perspectives are: \n- business aspects such as business information, business
    conventions, agreements and rules among Open-edi Parties; and\n- information technology
    aspects which are necessary in the Open-edi systems to support the execution of
    business transactions.\nThis International Standard is not an implementation specification
    nor is it a basis for appraising the conformance of implementations."
