  content: ISO/TR 14745:2015 provides recommendations for post-weld heat treatment
    (PWHT) of steels with recommendations for holding temperatures and holding times
    for different materials and material thicknesses. These recommendations are limited
    to stress relieving for non-alloy steels (groups 1, 2, 3, 4, and 11) and to tempering
    for Cr-Mo-(Ni) steels (groups 5 and 6) and martensitic stainless steels (group
    7.2), and are independent of type of product or location. The recommendations
    do not supersede any guidance given in material supplier specifications, e. g.
    thermo-mechanically treated fine-grain steels. It does not specify when PWHT is
    required. Such requirements are given in product standards, material specifications,
    or material data sheets.
