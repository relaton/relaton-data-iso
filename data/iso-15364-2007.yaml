abstract:
- content: "ISO 15364:2007 applies to pressure-vacuum relief valves protecting marine
    vessel systems, including cargo tanks, which may be subject to gas/vapour pressure
    or vacuum beyond the design parameters of the system/tank. \nISO 15364:2007 specifies
    the minimum requirements for performance and testing of pressure-vacuum relief
    valves, with emphasis on selection of materials, internal finish and surface requirements
    for pressure-vacuum valves installed on cargo tanks in tankers (see Annex A).
    It specifies design and in-service performance criteria, operational testing and
    maintenance requirements.\nCertification to ISO 15364:2007 does not imply suitability
    for any given installation; it indicates that certain minimum requirements have
    been considered and that information necessary for determination of suitability
    is provided to the buyer of the equipment."
