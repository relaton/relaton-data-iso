  content: Specifies geometrical tests on open front mechanical power presses and
    gives the corresponding permissible tolerances. It is applicable to machines of
    general purpose use and normal accuracy up to 2 500 kN capacity, and deals only
    with the verification of the accuracy of the machine. It does not apply to the
    testing of the running of the machine (vibrations, abnormal noises, stick-slip
    motion of components etc.), or to its characteristics (speeds, feeds, etc.), which
    should generally be checked before the accuracy is tested.
