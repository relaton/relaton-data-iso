    This document provides standard test methods for determining the vertical load, axial load and torsional moment capacity as well as deflection characteristics of preformed three-dimensional joist hangers that are used primarily for securing one timber member to another (the header can be concrete or masonry). The joist hangers primarily transfer vertical loads from the supported member to the supporting member, but they can also be required to transfer axial loads from the supported member to the supporting member.
    NOTE 1    Structural steel sections can also be substituted as the header, but are not covered in this document.
    NOTE 2    One secondary mechanism to be considered is the effect of rotation of the supported member about its longitudinal axis on the joist hanger.
