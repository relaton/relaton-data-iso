    This International Standard provides guidance to shipowners in the selection of a ship recycling facility.
    In order to ensure as far as possible that vessels are recycled in a safe and environmentally sound manner,
    shipowners need to consider to which ship recycling facilities they wish to sell their ships, and it is therefore
    important that ship recycling facilities provide certain objective information to assist in this selection process.
    Ship recycling facilities that are unwilling to provide this information on request by the shipowner cannot
    be objectively assessed.
    Since the shipowner might not be able to verify the information given, it is the sole responsibility of the ship
    recycling facilities to ensure that such information is correct. However, it is important that shipowners be critical
    in their consideration of any such information, and aware that some facilities might publish obviously false
    information or give contradictory data that make it apparent that the information supplied does not reflect
    reality. In such cases the facilities cannot be objectively assessed.
    It applies to the process of selecting a ship recycling facility and the use of a pro forma contract. It does not
    consider other aspects of ship recycling which are covered by other standards of the ISO 30000 series.
    This International Standard is applicable to shipowners who wish
    a) to select a ship recycling facility in order to carry out safe and environmentally sound ship recycling,
    b) to demonstrate conformity with the ISO 30000 series, and
    c) to ensure themselves that the ship recycling facility chosen is in conformity with the ISO 30000 series.
    This International Standard does not limit shipowners to selling to or recycling at facilities that have ISO 30000
    certification.
