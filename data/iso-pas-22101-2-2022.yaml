    This document is applicable to short glass fibre reinforced polyethylene (PE-sGF) pipes manufactured by the spiral cross winding method, which are used below ground for the conveyance of liquid fluids for the following industrial and agricultural uses:
    —    chemical plants;
    —    industrial sewerage engineering;
    —    power engineering (cooling and general-purpose water supply);
    —    agricultural production plants;
    —    water treatment.
    —    small hydraulic power plants (general-purpose water supply);
    In conjunction with the other parts of the ISO 22101 series, this document applies to PE-sGF pipes, fittings and their joints with each other, with other PE-sGF components, and to components from other materials intended for use under the following conditions:
    a) allowable operating pressure (PFA) up to and including 25 bar[1];
    b) operating temperature of 20 °C as the reference temperature.
    NOTE       For other operation temperatures, guidance is given in ISO/PAS 22101-1:2022, Annex A.
    Other application areas differing from those listed in the scope can be permitted if the requirements of this document and/or relevant national requirements are taken into account. Drinking water applications are outside the scope of this document.
    This document is applicable to pipes with an inside diameter of 200 mm to 1 000 mm with integrated socket and spigot fusion joint.
    Components conforming to any of the documents listed in the Bibliography or to national standards, as applicable, can be used with components conforming to this document, provided that they conform to the requirements for joint dimensions and to the relevant requirements of this document.
     
    [1] 1 bar = 0,1 MPa = 105 Pa; 1 MPa = 1 N/mm2.
