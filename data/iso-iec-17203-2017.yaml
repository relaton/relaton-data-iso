    The Open Virtualization Format (OVF) Specification describes an open, secure, efficient and
    extensible format for the packaging and distribution of software to be run in virtual systems.
    The OVF package enables the authoring of portable virtual systems and the transport of virtual
    systems between virtualization platforms. This version of the specification (2.1) is intended to allow
    OVF 1.x tools to work with OVF 2.x descriptors in the following sense:
    Existing OVF 1.x tools should be able to parse OVF 2.x descriptors.
    Existing OVF 1.x tools should be able to give warnings/errors if dependencies to 2.x
                 features are required for correct operation.
    If a conflict arises between the schema, text, or tables, the order of precedence to resolve the conflicts
    is schema; then text; then tables. Figures are for illustrative purposes only and are not a normative
    part of the standard.
    A table may constrain the text but it shall not conflict with it.
    The profile conforms to the cited CIM Schema classes where used. Any requirements contained in the
    cited CIM Schema classes shall be met. If a conflict arises the CIM Schema takes precedence.
    The profile conforms to the cited OVF XML Schema. It may constrain the schema but it shall not
    conflict with it. If a conflict arises the OVF XML Schema takes precedence.
