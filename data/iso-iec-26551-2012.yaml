  content: "ISO/IEC 26551:2012 provides the capabilities of tools and methods that
    support Software and Systems Product Line (SSPL) requirements engineering. In
    SSPL requirements engineering, there are three core processes: Product Line scoping,
    Domain Requirements Engineering, and Application Requirements Engineering. \nThe
    major purpose of Product Line Scoping estimates the costs and benefits of a product
    line, and thereby lets an organization make a go/no-go decision.The costs and
    benefits estimation results play a pivotal role as an indicator for assessing
    the effectiveness and efficiency of a product line.\nThe major purpose of the
    Domain Requirements Engineering is to analyze commonality and variability for
    the product line based on the initial features defined in Product Line Scoping,
    where the major purpose of the Application Requirements Engineering is to define
    application requirements based on domain requirements assets by reusing, selecting,
    or newly adding application specific requirements.\nFor producing multiple products
    in a product line, the above processes need to be adequately integrated centered
    around core assets, which is causing the management of domain/application requirements
    complexities. Thus, the proper supports of methods and tools are essential, and
    the product line specific capabilities of methods and tools have to be defined.\nISO/IEC
    26551:2012 can be used in the following modes:\n - By the users: to benefit people
    who develop, operate, and manage requirements engineering for software and systems
    product lines.\n - By a product line organization: to provide guidance in the
    evaluation and selection for tools and methods for product line requirements engineering.\n
    - By providers of tools and methods: to provide guidance in implementing or developing
    tools and methods by providing a comprehensive set of the capabilities of tools
    and methods for product line requirements engineering."
