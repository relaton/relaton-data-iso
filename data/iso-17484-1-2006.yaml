    ISO 17484-1:2006 specifies the general requirements and the performance requirements for multilayer pipe systems based on pipes, fittings and their joints intended to be used for gas supply within buildings.
    PE-X and PE pipes composed of one stress-designed layer, adhesive and a barrier layer are also covered by ISO 17484-1:2006.
    ISO 17484-1:2006 gives guidance for the design of piping systems consisting of multilayer pipes based on thermoplastics, for which at least 60 % of the wall thickness is polymeric material. Polymeric materials intended for stress-designed layers and all inner layers are required to be polyethylene (PE) and/or crosslinked polyethylene (PE-X). The outer layer of a metal multilayer is required to be PE or PE-X. PE-RT is considered as PE but with specific properties concerning hoop-stress performance.
    ISO 17484-1:2006 applies to systems that operate at temperatures of - 20 °C up to 60 °C.
    For the purpose of ISO 17484-1:2006, crosslinked polyethylene (PE-X) and adhesive layers are considered as thermoplastic materials.
    For sizes greater than 63 mm the requirements of ISO 18225 have to be fulfilled in addition.
    ISO 17484-1:2006 is applicable for piping systems used in buildings to supply gas with a maximum operating pressure up to and including 500 kPa (5 bar).
    ISO 17484-1:2006 applies to Category D gaseous fuel, natural gas, and Category E gaseous fuel, LPG vapour, and natural gas or LPG vapour.
