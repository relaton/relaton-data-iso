  content: Cancels and replaces the first edition (1986). Specifies a photometric
    method for the determination of trace amounts of copper in raw rubber, latices
    and compounded rubber, both natural and synthetic. May be applied to rubbers containing
    silica, provided that treatment with hydrofluoric acid is included in the procedure.
    The method is sensitive down to 1 mg/kg copper.
