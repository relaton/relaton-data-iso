abstract:
- content: This document provides formal procedures and two, alternative, methods
    (users are advised to choose whichever of the two suits their individual requirements)
    for determining the priority of on-board messages presented to drivers of road
    vehicles by transport information and control systems (TICS) and other systems.
    It is applicable to the whole range of TICS in-vehicle messages, including traveller
    information, navigation, travel and traffic advisories, "yellow pages" information,
    warnings, systems status, emergency calling system information, and electronic
    toll/fee collection, as well as to messages from non-TICS sources such as telephone,
    warnings and telltales. Although applicable to systems that allow the free generation
    of messages, it neither provides guidance on how to use the messages deriving
    from its procedures nor is it applicable to mandatory or legally required messages.
