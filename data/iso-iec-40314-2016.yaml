  content: "ISO/IEC 40314:2016 defines the Mathematical Markup Language, or MathML.
    \nMathML is a markup language for describing mathematical notation and capturing
    both its structure and content. The goal of MathML is to enable mathematics to
    be served, received, and processed on the World Wide Web, just as HTML has enabled
    this functionality for text.\nMathML can be used to encode both mathematical notation
    and mathematical content. Additional chapters discuss how the MathML content and
    presentation elements interact, and how MathML renderers might be implemented
    and should interact with browsers. Finally, this document addresses the issue
    of special characters used for mathematics, their handling in MathML, their presence
    in Unicode, and their relation to fonts.\nMathML was originally specified as an
    XML application and most of the examples in this specification assume that syntax.
    Unless explictly noted, the examples in this specification are also valid HTML
    syntax."
