    ISO 20632:2008 specifies a test method for determining the reaction to fire performance of pipe insulation products and some pipe insulation systems installed in a small room.
    The scenario is valid for fires in a room where pipe insulation products are installed within building applications, e.g., pipe and duct rooms in public buildings, apartment blocks, hospitals and ships.
    This method is suitable for products that cannot be tested in a small-scale test, or for correlation of small-scale test data. The method can also serve as a reference scenario for pipe insulation products or for systems fitted in a room within a building or a ship.
