  content: Focuses on one atomic action branch and covers the relevant service primitives
    with their types and parameters, and the behaviour as to how these service primitives
    can be issued and received by the CCR service provider. Service primitives and
    its parameters are defined in clause 8. The sequential rules on superior side
    are defined in clause 9, and on subordinate side in clause 10. The relation of
    the events that occur on the superior and subordinate sides are decribed in clause
    11.
