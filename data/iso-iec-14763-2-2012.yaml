abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 14763-2:2012(E) specifies requirements for the planning, installation
    and operation of cabling and cabling infrastructures (including cabling, pathways,
    spaces, earthing and bonding) in support of generic cabling standards and associated
    documents. The following aspects are addressed:   - specification of the installation,\n-
    quality assurance,                \n- installation planning,            \n- installation
    practice,            \n- documentation,                    \n- administration,
    \                                        \n- testing,                                                \n-
    inspection,                                             \n- operation,                                              \n-
    maintenance and repair. The requirements of Clauses 5 to 14 of this standard are
    premises-independent and may be amended by the requirements of premises-specific
    Annexes. This first edition supersedes Clauses 11 and 12 of ISO/IEC 11801, published
    in 2002, replaces ISO/IEC 14763-1, published in 1999, its Amendment 1 (2004),
    ISO/IEC TR 14763-2, published in 2000, ISO/IEC 18010, published in 2002, and its
    Amendment 1 (2005) and constitutes a technical revision. It includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition: In addition
    to the supersession of parts of earlier standards and the incorporation of other
    standards, this standard provides much greater detail in all aspects of planning
    and installation with respect to ISO/IEC/TR 14763-2 and provides clearly differentiated
    and directed requirements and recommendations."
