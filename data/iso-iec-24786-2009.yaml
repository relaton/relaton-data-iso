  content: "People with disabilities (e.g. visual, hearing, physical) can experience
    difficulties in accessing computers and other information/communication technology
    (ICT) devices. Accessible user interfaces, as defined in ISO/IEC 24786:2009, can
    help them to operate computers if they are able to adjust accessibility settings
    prior to use. If this is not possible, some people will not be able to access
    these devices without help from another party. \nISO/IEC 24786:2009 specifies
    requirements and recommendations for making accessibility settings accessible.
    This will make the information technologies more accessible by ensuring that people
    with disabilities can adjust accessibility settings by themselves. \nISO/IEC 24786:2009
    provides guidance on specific accessibility settings. It specifies how to access
    and operate the accessibility setting mode, and how to directly activate specific
    accessibility functions. \nISO/IEC 24786:2009 applies to all operating system
    user interfaces on computers, but can also be applied to other types of ICT, where
    appropriate. It does not apply to the user interface before the operating system
    is loaded and active."
