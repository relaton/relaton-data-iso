    This document provides guidance on the mapping of a set of user accessibility needs with the provisions of a particular standard, technical report, or set of guidelines. It provides both basic guidance that should be used for all user accessibility needs mapping and optional guidance that may be added to the basic guidance.
    User accessibility needs mapping is intended to help improve accessibility for all users and, in particular, for users with special needs that can be overlooked. User accessibility needs mapping is not intended to be used to evaluate or certify a given standard or set of guidelines.
