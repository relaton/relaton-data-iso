- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: Specifies two methods for industrial calcined products. The first, using
    carbon tetrachloride vapour, is applicable if the density of the material exceeds
    3.75 g/ml; the second, using water vapour, is applicable if the density of the
    material is lower than 3.75 g/ml. The adsorptive power is evaluated by exposure
    of a previously dried sample to an atmosphere saturated with carbon tetrachloride
    or water vapour at a conventional temperature. Measurement of the quantity of
    the corresponding vapour adsorbed after a conventional time. Has also been approved
    by the IUPAC.
