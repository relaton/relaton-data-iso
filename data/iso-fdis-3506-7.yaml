abstract:
- content: "This document specifies grades and mechanical and physical properties
    of flat washers made of austenitic, ferritic and duplex steel grades, designed
    to be used in bolted joints in combination with bolts, screws, studs and nuts
    with a specified property class in accordance with ISO 3506-1 and ISO 3506-2.\nThese
    types of washers may also be used with other fasteners such as screws forming
    their own mating thread \nThis part of ISO 3506 is applicable to the following
    flat captive and non captive washers made of corrosion-resistant stainless steel:\n—\tplain
    washers (with or without knurls, ribs or chamfers);\n—\tsquare washers;\n—\tsquare
    hole washers;\n—\tshaped plates."
