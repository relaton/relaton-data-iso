    ISO 6450:2005 specifies two methods (methods 1 and 2) of evaluating the resistance of fabrics coated with plastics or with vulcanized rubber to the action of liquids by measurement of selected properties of the materials before and after immersion in selected liquids.
    The difference between the two methods is as follows:
    - In method 1, excess liquid is removed from the test pieces, after immersion, by wiping.
    - In method 2, the test pieces are immersed in a volatile liquid and excess liquid is subsequently removed by drying in an oven.
