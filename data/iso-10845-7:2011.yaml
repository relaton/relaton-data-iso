  content: |-
    ISO 10845-7:2011 establishes a key performance indicator in the form of a contract participation goal (CPG) relating to the engagement of local enterprises and labour on a contract for the provision of services or engineering and construction works. A CPG may be used to measure the outcomes of a contract in relation to the engagement of local enterprises and labour or to establish a target level of performance for the contractor to achieve or exceed in the performance of a contract.
    ISO 10845-7:2011 sets out the methods by which the key performance indicator is measured, quantified and verified in the performance of the contract in respect of two different targeting strategies: targeting strategy A and targeting strategy B.
