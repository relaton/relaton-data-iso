  content: "ISO/IEC 23915:2005 specifies signalling interworking between \"QSIG\"
    and the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) in support of call diversion within
    corporate telecommunication networks (CN), also known as enterprise networks.\n\"QSIG\"
    is a signalling protocol that operates between Private Integrated services Network
    eXchanges (PINX) within a Private Integrated Services Network (PISN). A PISN provides
    circuit-switched basic services and supplementary services to its users. \nSIP
    is an application layer protocol for establishing, terminating and modifying multimedia
    sessions. It is typically carried over IP.\nISO/IEC 23915:2005 specifies signalling
    interworking for call diversion during the establishment of calls between a PISN
    employing QSIG and a corporate IP network employing SIP. It covers both the impact
    on SIP of call diversion in the QSIG network and the impact on QSIG of request
    retargeting in the SIP network.\nISO/IEC 23915:2005 is applicable to any interworking
    unit that can act as a gateway between a PISN employing QSIG and a corporate IP
    network employing SIP."
