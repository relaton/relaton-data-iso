abstract:
- content: |-
    This document describes the principle of electrochemical noise measurement (EN), specifically focusing on the application of the technique to indicate the level of protection provided by an organic coating to the underlying metal. It discusses the principles behind the measurement method but also the type of electrochemical apparatus, the experimental set-up and electrodes configurations, the presentation of measured data, and analysis of results that have been used in the work done so far and reported in the references. This work has mainly been done in the laboratory, and there are some examples of work conducted in the field.
    NOTE       At the time of publication of this document, electrochemical noise measurement for coatings is mainly used by a number of academic groups. This document aims to encourage more general application of this method, particularly to field work.
