  content: This document specifies a calculation procedure for the maximum bearing
    temperature and effective dynamic viscosity in the lubricant film of oil-lubricated
    and statically loaded hydrodynamic plain journal bearings with a circular cylindrical
    shape, angular span Ω of 360° and width ratio B* of 0,5 to 1,5 under fluid lubrication
    regime. The bearing characteristics are obtained by design charts from four dimensionless
    numbers which are calculated from bearing dimensions, operating conditions and
    viscosity characteristics of the lubricant.
