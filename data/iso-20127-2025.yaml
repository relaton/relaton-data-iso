    This document specifies requirements and test methods for the physical properties of powered toothbrushes in order to promote the safety of these products for their intended use.
    There are different technologies of powered toothbrushes. Common features of those powered toothbrushes to which this document applies are:
    —     a battery;
    —     a motor;
    —     a mechanical or magnetic drive system;
    —     a moving brush head with tufted filaments.
    Powered toothbrushes can have a moving brush head with different motions (e.g. oscillating-rotating, side-by-side), frequencies and velocities.
    These types of electric toothbrushes are tested for safety in use by means of appropriate test procedures or clinical studies
    The requirements listed in this document apply to all types of powered toothbrushes. However, there is a possibility that some requirements are not applicable for all types. For example, brush head plate retention can only be applied if the brush has a head portion that can detach from the brush shaft. In addition, for the filaments end-rounding requirements, this document does not apply to filament types that are very thin (less than 0,1 mm outside diameter) or have no sharp edges (e.g. tapered, feathered, with split tips or spherical cap) or non-synthetic filaments, where applying the end-rounding process is inappropriate or impossible.
    This document is not applicable to other types of powered oral hygiene devices (such as powered interdental brushes) or manual toothbrushes.
