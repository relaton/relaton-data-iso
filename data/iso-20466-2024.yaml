    This document provides guidance and requirements for grade classification of performance of recovered reverse osmosis (RO) membranes for water reuse systems.
    This standard is applicable to the spiral-wound type of recovered membranes from seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO) and brackish water reverse osmosis (BWRO) systems.
    This standard is to ensure consistency in the performance of recovered RO membranes. It does not specify any method or process for the recovery of RO membranes.
