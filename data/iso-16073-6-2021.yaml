    This document covers the general design, minimum performance requirements and methods of test for wildland firefighting footwear. This document does not cover PPE for structural firefighting (see ISO 11999 series), for use against chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear hazards, ISO 18639 series PPE for firefighters undertaking specific rescue activities or for use where a reflective outer surface is required (see ISO 15538).
    Activities in support of wildland firefighting, such as the cutting of trees and the use of a chainsaw can require additional protection to that provided in this document. Users are directed to those relevant standards for the requirements associated with such protection.
