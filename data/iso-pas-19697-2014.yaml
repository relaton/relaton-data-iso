    ISO/PAS 19697:2014 specifies the performance requirements, methods of testing, and test results of electronic inclinometers required by the performance standard, IMO resolution MSC.363 (92) in addition to the general requirements contained in resolution A.694 (17) and is associated with IEC 60945.
    The electronic inclinometers provide information about actual heel angle, roll amplitude, roll period to support decision-making process on board in order to avoid dangerous situations as well as to assist in maritime casualty investigation. The electronic inclinometers are mainly composed of a set of sensors, a signal processor, a display, an input device, and an interface to other systems.
    It does not apply to the electronic inclinometers installed for purposes which are outside the scope of ISO/PAS 19697:2014, e.g. monitoring of cargo status.
