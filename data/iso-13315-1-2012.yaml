    1 Scope
    This part of ISO 13315 provides a framework and basic rules on environmental management related to
    concrete and concrete structures. This includes the assessment of the environmental impacts and methods of
    implementing environmental improvement based on the assessment.
    This part of ISO 13315 is used when assessing the environmental impacts and implementing the environmental
    management of concrete and concrete structures for the environmental consideration in activities related to
    the production of concrete constituents, the production, recycling and disposal of concrete, and the design,
    execution, use and demolition of concrete structures. It is applied for their entire lifecycles, respective stages of
    the lifecycles, or certain ranges of the lifecycles. This part of ISO 13315 is relevant to newly produced concrete
    and newly constructed concrete structures, and also existing concrete and concrete structures.
    This part of ISO 13315 applies not only to single concretes but also to concrete families and not only to single
    concrete structures but also to concrete structure complexes. For materials other than concrete, the related
    ISO standards are applied where available. In the case where no ISO standard is available, such materials are
    appropriately dealt with referring to this part of ISO 13315 and the normative references.
    The environments covered by this part of ISO 13315 include global, regional and local environments. The
    indoor pollution of buildings and the environments for workers in concrete producing plants and on concrete
    structure construction sites are not specifically covered by this part of ISO 13315. This part of ISO 13315 does
    not directly deal with the environmental impacts resulting from the operation of equipment installed in concrete
    structures. However, the special properties of concrete and concrete structures affecting the operational
    efficiency of such equipment are considered in this part of ISO 13315.
    This part of ISO 13315 covers secondary effects of the production of concrete and execution of concrete structures.
    This part of ISO 13315 may also cover the economic and social effects of environmental consideration in the
    production of concrete and execution of concrete structures.
    NOTE 1 ISO 16814 is available for reference as a standard for the indoor pollution of buildings.
    NOTE 2 The working environments of plants and construction sites are generally prescribed by industrial safety
    and health laws.
    NOTE 3 In buildings, global warming substances are mainly emitted from energy consumption due to the operation of
    heating, ventilating and air-conditioning equipment.
    NOTE 4 The beneficial effects such as thermal mass and other functions of concrete and concrete structures may be
    taken into account.
    NOTE 5 The secondary effects of the production of concrete include the future possibility of leaching of heavy metals from
    concrete or the absorption of heavy metals from the environment, the effect of waste treatments on the environment, etc.
