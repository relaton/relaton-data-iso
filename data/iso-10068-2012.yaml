    ISO 10068:2012 specifies the mechanical impedance of the human male hand-arm system at the driving point. Values of the impedance, expressed as modulus and phase, are provided for three orthogonal, translatory directions of excitation that correspond to the xh-, yh- and zh-axes of the basicentric coordinate system.
    The xh-, yh- and zh-components of impedance are defined as a function of frequency, from 10 Hz to 500 Hz, for specified arm positions, grip and feed forces, handle diameters, and intensities of excitation. The components of impedance in the three directions are treated as being independent.
    ISO 10068:2012 can be used to define typical values of the mechanical impedance of the hand-arm system at the driving point, applicable to males under the circumstances specified. ISO 10068:2012 can provisionally be applied to females.
    Reference values of the mechanical impedance at the driving point are provided as a function of frequency for a specified grip and feed force.
    These impedance values are intended for the determination of the transmissibility of resilient materials when loaded by the hand-arm system.
    Mathematical representations of the hand-arm system that model the mean values of apparent mass or impedance are provided.
    A gloved hand-arm model is described, and the frequency dependence of vibration power absorption in the hand-arm system is also provided.
    To help conduct further measurement of the mechanical impedance, especially for circumstances that are not specified in ISO 10068:2012, information on the measurement of mechanical impedance is provided.
