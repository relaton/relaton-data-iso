abstract:
- content: "This part of ISO/IEC 14478 describes a set of Object types and non-Object
    types to provide the construction of, presentation of, and the interaction with
    Multimedia information. The multimedia information tan be graphics, Video, audio,
    or other types of presentable media. This information tan be enhanced by time
    aspects. Throughout this document this part of ISO/IEC 14478 will also be referred
    to as \"Modelling, Rendering and Interaction\", and abbreviated as MRI. The Modelling,
    Rendering and Interaction Component constitutes a framework of ?Middleware', System
    Software components lying between the generic operating System and computing environment,
    and a specific application operating as a client of the Services and type definitions
    provided by this component. It provides a framework over the foundation objects
    and multimedia Systems Services defined in other Parts of the international Standard
    for the development of a distributed and heterogeneous network of devices for
    creating multimedia models, rendering these models, and interacting with this
    process. \nThe Modelling, Rendering and Interaction Component encompasses the
    following characteristics:\na) Provision of a hierarchy of multimedia primitives
    as an abstract framework for describing the capabilities of modelling and rendering
    devices, and for enabling their interoperation; \nb) within the primitive hierarchy,
    specific Provision for describing the temporal structure of multimedia data through
    the stepwise construction of structured primitives from component data; \nc) Provision
    of abstract types for modelers, renderers and other supporting devices, enabling
    the integration of such devices or any future subtypes representing real Software
    or hardware, into a processing network of such devices;\nd) provision of an Object
    type to map synchronization requirements expressed within multimedia primitives
    into control of the stream and synchronization mechanisms provided by ISO/IEC
    14478-2 and ISO/IEC 14478-3. \nThe Modelling, Rendering and Interaction Component
    relies on the Object types and Services defined in PREMO Part 2: Foundation Components
    (ISO/IEC 1447%2), and PREMO Part 3: Multimedia Systems Services (ISO/IEC 14478-3)."
