- content: |-
    This document describes general ergonomics requirements in relation to dynamic signs, as this responsive information presentation technology changes depending on the environmental conditions in which it is used (e.g. environmental illumination, density of people).
    Dynamic signs are presented adaptively to those environmental conditions.
    The general requirements for dynamic signs consist of visibility (divided into conspicuity, distinctiveness, legibility and comprehensibility), visual image safety and accessibility. The requirements and recommendations for each are also described.
    This document does not cover static signs.
    This document does not include requirements for safety signs for the marking of escape routes.
    NOTE            There are some related recommendations in ISO 30061.
