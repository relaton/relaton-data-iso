    This document provides information and examples of measurement methods for evaluating the image quality of digital photographic reflection prints, including prints produced by ink jet, thermal dye transfer, electrophotography and silver halide (chromogenic) technologies. These measurement methods are intended especially to be applicable to small prints with a size of available picture area ranging from 35 mm × 45 mm to 360 mm × 450 mm, a popular and basic application of photographic print technology.
    NOTE    The definition of "digital print" here is print made directly from digital data when there is no intermediate image carrier, or when the image carrier is refreshed for each impression, and thus each impression can be different in content if desired.
