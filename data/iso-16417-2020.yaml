    This document establishes the terminology and content of commercial specifications for hydraulic breakers which are mounted as an attachment on a carrier, typically earth-moving machinery such as an excavator, backhoe loader, skid steer loader, and compact loader as defined in ISO 6165; or mounted on a rig, pedestal boom system, demolition robot, etc., at the end of an arm.
    Hydraulic breakers are typically used to demolish or break rock, concrete, brickwork, asphalt, etc.
    This document does not cover breakers powered by pneumatic, thermomechanical, or electromagnetic energy. This document does not cover portable or hand-held breakers either.
