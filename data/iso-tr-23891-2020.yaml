    This document gives a brief overview of the current (2019) situation in plastic recycling systems, relevant existing standards and short description of different recycling techniques. It aims to identify the necessity of standards in the plastics recycling system and give direction for the adoption of regional standards and/or the development of new and existing standards.
    This document addresses various recycling options, with focus on, but not limited to, mechanical recycling, chemical and/or feedstock recycling and the corresponding preparatory activities.
    This document excludes organic recycling (also designated as biological recycling) and energy recovery.
