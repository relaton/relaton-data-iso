abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 15944-4:2007 focuses on providing a definition of the concepts
    and the relationships that exist among those concepts in an Open-edi business
    transaction. Such a repository of conceptual definitions is termed a domain ontology
    for Open-edi.\nIt addresses the fundamental and definable aspects of a business
    transaction as it unfolds with business partners: first planning their activities,
    then identifying their prospective trading partners, then negotiating commitments
    for economic exchanges, and finally fulfilling those commitments with reciprocated
    transfers of economic resources. The key concepts required for an Open-edi business
    transaction, which are derived from the fields of accounting and economics, are
    defined. \nISO/IEC 15944-4:2007 provides the ontological specification with an
    enumeration of the primitive and derived data classes needed in a full economic
    exchange. These definitions are specified with class diagrams from the Unified
    Modelling Language (UML). This is the declarative component of the Open-edi Business
    Transaction Ontology (OeBTO).\nISO/IEC 15944-4:2007 identifies the procedural
    components of the OeBTO: its computable mechanisms for tracking progress through
    an actual business process where partners exchange information with each other
    as they progress through the Open-edi trading phases of planning, identification,
    negotiation, actualization and post-actualization. This progress is determined
    with specified state machine mechanics. ISO/IEC 15944-4:2007 finishes by identifying
    the constraint component of the OeBTO: its repository for business rules and assertions.\nCultural
    adaptability and integration with the other parts of ISO/IEC 15944 is provided
    by supplying a list of consolidated French definitions and by enumerating the
    two classes of Open-edi constraints. Theoretical background for the ontological
    components of the OeBTO is provided by enumerating the Resource-Event-Agent (REA)
    ontology as that work is being used in standards work with the United Nations
    Centre for Trade Facilitation and Electronic Business (UN/CEFACT). \nUse of ISO/IEC
    15944-4:2007 (and related standards) will facilitate the integration of these
    ontological definitions into specified, registered and re-useable eBusiness scenarios
    and scenario components."
