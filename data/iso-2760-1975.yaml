  content: Applicable to products having a total content up to 1 %. Is not applicable
    in the presence of zirconium or titanium. More than 0.006 % of iron will interfere
    in the determination. The principle bases on fusion of a test portion with sodium
    carbonate and extraction of the molten mass with hydrochloric acid. Formation
    of a complex by the addition of the disodium salt of ethylenediamintetra-ecetic
    acid (EDTA). Decomposition of the complex by sodium fluoride followed by titration
    of the liberated EDTA with a standard volumetric solution of zinc chloride in
    the presence of xylenol orange as indicator.
