    This document provides guidelines for local government on establishing and managing cross-sector partnerships for societal resilience to disruptions arising from major emergencies, disasters, or crises.  It covers how local government should lead the design and implementation of a strategy to build societal resilience to disruption, including:

    - agreeing local government’s own ambition;
    - building the cross-sector partnership and establishing a shared vision;
    - identifying societal risks, needs, vulnerabilities, and existing capabilities;
    - agreeing the design of activities to establish local resilience capabilities;
    - developing activities with the partnership to implement the plan;
    - managing the local resilience capabilities;
    - evaluating and continually improving local resilience capabilities.

    The document takes a whole-of-society approach to resilience through local government adopting principles and developing capabilities that support societal networks, organizations (from private, public, and voluntary sectors), community groups, and individuals.

    It is for use by those in local government who seek to enhance the resilience of society to disruption through an approach based on co-production.
