    ISO/TS 11774:2011 provides a method for qualification of non-destructive testing (NDT) personnel, procedures, and equipment for specific non-destructive tests conducted in accordance with documented procedures established within a performance-based qualification programme.
    Implementation of ISO/TS 11774:2011 requires cooperation between applicable industry sector committees (ISCs) and qualification bodies to ensure that specific performance expectations are addressed.
    The qualification methodology described in ISO/TS 11774:2011 is based upon the ability of a candidate to demonstrate capability in detecting and sizing critical discontinuities equivalent to those to be detected and sized in the performance-based qualification programme as established by the ISC.
    It is possible that second party (employer-based) qualification and approval (e.g. in accordance with ANSI/ASNT CP-189) or qualification and third party certification (e.g. in accordance with ISO 9712 or EN 473), followed by on-the-job training does not provide the required degree of confidence for safety critical inspections, and ISO/TS 11774:2011 provides criteria to assist in preparing an individual for performance-based qualification examinations.
    Qualification to ISO/TS 11774:2011 is limited to the specific applications, using the specific documented procedure in the performance-based qualification programme.
