abstract:
- content: |-
    ISO 21263:2017 specifies a method for the determination of the slow release properties of nutrients from coated fertilizers. pH-dependent hydrolysis and degradation by biological or microbial mechanisms are excluded.
    The specified method is only applicable to products releasing any nutrients by means of a non-biological process (i.e. those where the nutrients are released by a physical mechanism). Microbial attack on the coating (e.g. sulfur coated fertilizers) and the consequences thereof are not measurable by the technique described.
    This method involves a lengthy process which may not be appropriate for day to day testing purposes. Accelerated methods can be used provided they are correlated with this document. An example of such an accelerated method is described in Annex B. Regression analysis can also be used for this purpose.
