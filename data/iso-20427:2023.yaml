    This document specifies sample preparation methods to determine the size distribution of separate particles of a single pigment or extender, which is dispersed in a liquid by application of a standardized dispersion procedure, using an ultrasonic device, shaker device or wet jet mill.
    The sample preparation methods described are optimized for measurements carried out with a particle sizing technique based on sedimentation. This technique relies on particle migration due to gravitation or centrifugal forces and requires a density contrast between the particles and the liquid phase.
