    ISO 10904:2011 specifies technical requirements and methods for the inspection and testing of straight short and long fibre-cement profiled sheets and their fibre-cement fittings designed to provide the weather-exposed surfaces on roofs and internal and external walls of buildings.
    Products covered by ISO 10904:2011 can be used for other purposes, provided they comply with the appropriate national or international application code or standard.
    Some of the requirements of ISO 10904:2011 can apply, after agreement between manufacturer and purchaser, to curved profiled sheets.
    The type tests described in ISO 10904:2011 are not intended to evaluate the performance of the coating in isolation (color fastness, adhesion, etc.). Specific performance requirements for coatings are referenced in other International Standards or national standards.
    ISO 10904:2011 does not apply to fibre-cement profiled sheets and fittings reinforced with asbestos fibres.
