    This document describes the test methods for light stability measurements of prints on transparent or translucent foils, sheets and paper or printed on a textile, which are displayed on backlit units installed in indoor or in shaded outdoor conditions, which are protected against direct precipitation and radiative heating. Installations of backlit display units in outdoor areas without shading, which are exposed to direct weathering and/or radiative heating, are excluded.
    This document is applicable to the various product classes of “commercial prints” that are suitable for backlit display. These commercial prints often contain combinations of text, pictorial images and/or artwork.
    This document provides guidelines for colour measurements, data analysis and also provides guidance for translation of test results into suitable image permanence performance claims considering the variability of backlit designs and environmental conditions.
    This document is applicable to both analogue and digitally printed matter. Methods and principles apply to both, colour, and monochrome prints.
