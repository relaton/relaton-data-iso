  content: "ISO/TR 23697:2011 can be applied to textiles and textile products and
    is concerned only with test methods which operate in a continuous scale to yield
    a single numerical figure as the test result. However, this single figure can
    be the outcome of a calculation from a set of measurements.\nThe distribution
    of test results is required to be unimodal and is assumed to be normal. With non-Gaussian
    distributions, other evaluation procedures will be necessary. \nIt does not cover
    methods which yield discrete values, \"pass/fail\" (go/no go) type results, (accept/reject)
    tests or where a ranking scheme is in operation."
