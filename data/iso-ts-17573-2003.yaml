  content: "ISO/TS 17573:2003 specifies a system architecture for electronic fee collection
    (EFC) systems concerning vehicle related transport services such as the use of
    toll roads, zone access, parking and route guidance.\nISO/TS 17573:2003 does not
    cover person related transport services such as public transport. However, some
    of the clauses in ISO/TS 17573:2003 may also be applicable for fare collection.
    \nNOTE Fare collection architecture in public transport is covered by other Working
    Groups in CEN/TC278 and ISO/TC204, e.g. WG3 Public Transport in CEN/TC278.\nISO/TS
    17573:2003 provides the overview of, and inter-relationship among, the set of
    standards for design, development, testing and operation of applications in the
    field of EFC.\nISO/TS 17573:2003 is also applicable to the ITS Fundamental Service
    called Electronic Financial Transactions which is the use of electronic, or \"cashless\"
    payment systems for transportation. Hence, ISO/TS 17573:2003 covers toll collection
    systems, parking fee collection systems, systems for road and congestion pricing
    and integrated payment systems for transport services."
