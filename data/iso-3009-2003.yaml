  content: ISO 3009:2003 provides a test method for determining and assessing the
    fire resistance performance of both insulated and uninsulated glazed elements
    of building construction, when those elements are exposed to heating on one face.
    It is applicable to glazed separating elements such as screens, walls of glass
    blocks and other light-transmitting assemblies used in vertical, inclined or horizontal
    orientations, and to all separating elements containing glazing intended to be
    assessed in accordance with ISO 834-1, except for doors and shutter assemblies,
    which are intended to be tested in accordance with ISO 3008. It is directly applicable
    to planar elements, but also gives guidance on the testing of non-planar elements
    such as pyramids.
