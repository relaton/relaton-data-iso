    deals with the\n            representation of interconnect design.\n            This
    data provides functional and physical layout information sufficient to allow manufacture

    with traceability. Complete traceability\n            back to requirements is

    specifications, process specifications, material specifications including manufacturing\n

    This data identifies\n            those elements that do not meet design requirements.
    This data includes both design view\n            and usage view of the interconnect
