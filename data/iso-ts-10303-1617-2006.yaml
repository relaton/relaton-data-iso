- content: "ISO/TS 10303-1617:2006 specifies the application module for\n         AP210

    deals with the\n            representation of interconnect design.\n            This
    data provides functional and physical layout information sufficient to allow manufacture
    and\n            test of an interconnect. Design re-use is explicitly supported
    with traceability. Complete traceability\n            back to requirements is
    provided. Product connection requirements, shape requirements,\n            product
    specifications, process specifications, material specifications including manufacturing\n
    \           view of stackup, geometric dimensioning and tolerancing are provided.
    This data identifies\n            those elements that do not meet design requirements.
    This data includes both design view\n            and usage view of the interconnect
    product. Support for specification of signal prioritization is\n            provided.
    Support for specifying the explicit network topology to be implemented is provided.\n
    \           Configuration management information and design change management
    information is provided. This\n            data includes at least one geometric
    representation.\n            \t\n         \n\n         The following are within
    the scope of \n         ISO/TS 10303-1617:2006:\n         \n      \n- two dimensional
    layered interconnect substrate;\n- configuration management data;\n- design management
