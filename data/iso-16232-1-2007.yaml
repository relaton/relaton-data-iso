abstract:
- content: "ISO 16232-1:2007 defines the vocabulary used in the characterization and
    measurement of particulate contamination of parts, components, sub-assemblies
    and assemblies constituting the fluid circuits of internal combustion engines
    of road vehicles. This applies to all components that may come into contact with
    a liquid (e.g. oil, fuel, air conditioning refrigerant, coolant), a solid lubricant
    or a gas (intake air).\nUnless otherwise specified, ISO 16232-1:2007 deals with
    particulate cleanliness only. It does not therefore cover appearance defects or
    contamination by liquid or gas materials. \nIt covers the amount and the nature
    of residual particulate contaminants resulting from the whole manufacturing processes
    and from the environment."
