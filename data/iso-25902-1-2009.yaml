    ISO 25902-1:2009 specifies a method for the eddy-current examination for detecting flaws in titanium seamless tubes and welded tubes.
    Titanium tubes are now used as steam surface condensers in steam-power plants, anatomic-power plants and desalination plants. Therefore, the quality of titanium tubes is very important and this is why the eddy-current inspection method was established. This method also applies to titanium alloy tubes.
