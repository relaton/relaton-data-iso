    This document provides a collection of representative use cases of brain-computer interface (BCI) applications in a variety of domains: proposed medical and health, industrial controls, smart environment, etc.
    This document can be used for the development of potential standards, and it is valuable for a better comprehension of BCI. 
    This document is also helpful for BCI industries and products that provide support for communications among interested parties and stakeholders.
    This document is applicable to all types of organizations (e.g. commercial enterprises, government agencies, not-for-profit organizations).
