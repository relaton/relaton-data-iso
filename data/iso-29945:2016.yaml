    ISO 29945:2016 specifies a manual sampling method for refrigerated liquefied DME at terminals in both loading and unloading ports along with precautions.
    ISO 29945:2016 does not include recommendations for the location of a sampling point in a line or vessel.
    ISO 29945:2016 is also applicable to the following cases, with necessary modifications:
    -     sampling of DME on board liquefied gas tankers where appropriate sampling apparatus is provided;
    -     sampling of other refrigerated, non-petroleum-based, liquefied gaseous fuels whose chemical and physical properties are similar to those of DME.
    The detailed chemical and physical properties of DME differ from those of LPG, which suggests that DME requires precautions different from those of LPG. However, their basic properties are similar to each other and so general reference is made in this document to precautions for LPG that have been applied in many countries. Reference can also be made to the appropriate individual items in this document for precautions concerning the quality.
