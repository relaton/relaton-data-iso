abstract:
- content: |-
    ISO 18602:2013 specifies requirements and a procedure for assessment of packaging to ensure that the weight or volume of its material content is optimized consistent with the functions of packaging. This is one of several options for reducing the impact of packaging on the environment.
    It also provides methodologies and procedures for
    - determining the amount and minimization of substances or mixtures hazardous to the environment, and
    - determining the amount of four heavy metals (lead, cadmium, mercury, hexavalent chromium) in packaging.
    The process for packaging design, including material selection, is not part of ISO 18602:2013.
    The procedure for applying ISO 18602:2013 is contained in ISO 18601.
