    This document gives minimum safety, ergonomic, and performance requirements for Camera Monitor Systems to replace mandatory inside and outside rearview mirrors for road vehicles (e.g. classes I to IV as defined in UN Regulation No. 46). It addresses Camera Monitor Systems (CMS) that will be used in road vehicles to present the required outside information of a specific field of view inside the vehicle. These specifications are intended to be independent of different camera and display technologies unless otherwise stated explicitly. Advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), such as parking aids, are not part of this document.
    NOTE 1    Mirror classes V and VI (as defined in UN Regulation No. 46) are not in scope of this document since the requirements are already defined in UN Regulation No. 46.
    NOTE 2    The definitions and requirements in this document are formulated with regard to a system structure, where one camera captures one legally prescribed field of view and one monitor displays one legally prescribed field of view. Of course, also other system structures (e.g. with one monitor displaying two legally prescribed fields of view) are within the scope of this document. For those systems, either the system supplier or the vehicle manufacturer has to prove that the resulting system fulfils the requirements given in Clause 6.
    NOTE 3    Whenever the phrases "field of view" or "field of vision" are used, then both have the same meaning and are to be used in parallel.
