    ISO/IEC TR 15443-2:2005 describes a variety of IT security assurance methods and approaches and relates them to the IT security assurance framework in ISO/IEC TR 15443-1. The emphasis is to identify qualitative properties of the assurance methods and elements that contribute to assurance, and where possible, to define assurance ratings. This material is intended for IT security professionals for the understanding of how to obtain assurance in a given life-cycle stage of a product or service.
    The objective is to describe and categorize assurance methods and approaches in a manner enabling a review of their comparable and synergetic properties. This will facilitate selection of the appropriate assurance method or and possible combination of assurance methods for a given IT security product, system, or service and its specific environment.
