    ISO 12632:2015 specifies test methods for
    -      penetrability and removal times of labels that have been wet glued on bottles intended to be refilled and reused, and
    -      resistance of printed labels against hot alkaline solution.
    Test results always deal with systems comprising of substrates, ink films and varnish films if present. This International Standard is valid for label substrates and printed labels. Label substrates include metalized papers. The test procedures are also valid for the evaluation of inks and papers to be used in printing labels.
    ISO 12632:2015 does not purport to address all of the safety concerns, if any, associated with its use. It is the responsibility of the user of this International Standard to establish appropriate safety and health practices and determine the applicability of regulatory limitations prior to use.
