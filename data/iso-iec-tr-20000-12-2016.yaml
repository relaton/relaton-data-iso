    ISO/IEC TR 20000-12:2016 provides guidance on the relationship between ISO/IEC 20000‑1:2011 and CMMI-SVC V1.3 (through Maturity Level 3). Service providers can refer to this guidance as a cross-reference between the two documents to help them to plan and implement an SMS. An organization employing the practices in the indicated CMMI-SVC process areas can conform to many of the associated ISO/IEC 20000‑1 requirements.
    The guidance in Clause 4 describes how CMMI-SVC can support the demonstration of conformity to ISO/IEC 20000‑1:2011. A description of the purpose and content of both publications in 4.1 and 4.2 is followed by Clause 5, which relates process areas in CMMI-SVC to clauses in ISO/IEC 20000‑1:2011. The tables in Annexes A and B relate terms, clauses, and paragraphs in ISO/IEC 20000‑1:2011 to CMMI-SVC. Table B.1 is a simplified summary of the correlation seen in Table 3 for those readers who want an overview. The tables indicate those aspects of ISO/IEC 20000‑1:2011 and CMMI-SVC that represent the greatest link between the two sets of documents, from the perspective of a service provider.
    ISO/IEC TR 20000-12:2016 can be used by any organization or person who wishes to understand how CMMI-SVC can be used with ISO/IEC 20000‑1:2011, including the following:
    a)    a service provider that intends to demonstrate conformity to the requirements of ISO/IEC 20000‑1:2011 and is seeking guidance on the use of CMMI-SVC to establish and maintain the SMS and the services;
    b)    a service provider that has demonstrated conformity to the requirements of ISO/IEC 20000‑1:2011 and is seeking guidance on ways to use CMMI-SVC to improve the SMS and the services;
    c)    a service provider that already uses CMMI-SVC and is seeking guidance on how CMMI-SVC can be used to support efforts to demonstrate conformity to the requirements specified in ISO/IEC 20000‑1:2011;
    d)    an appraiser or assessor who wishes to understand the use of CMMI-SVC as support for the requirements specified in ISO/IEC 20000‑1:2011.
    ISO/IEC TR 20000-12:2016 can also be used with the other parts of the ISO/IEC 20000 series.
