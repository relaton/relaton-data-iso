abstract:
- content: This document specifies the designation and the characterization methods
    of the decorative metallic coatings of the products for radio wave transmissive
    application. The designation consists of the transmission loss of the radio wave,
    the frequency band of the radio wave under consideration, the lightness and hue
    of the parts, as well as the main material and manufacturing process of metallic
    coatings. The characterization methods consist of the determination of the transmission
    loss of radio wave with specific frequency band and the evaluation of lightness
    and hue which represent the colour and appearance.
