  content: This standard specifies the characterization of ceramic slurry for use
    as feedstock in vat photopolymerization additive manufacturing (AM) process. The
    characterization includes the composition and properties of the slurry, such as
    solids content, dynamic viscosity, particle size distribution, chemical composition,
    and solid dispersion stability. This standard also provides available methods
    about sampling and preparing slurry samples for testing. This standard does not
    deal with safety aspects.
