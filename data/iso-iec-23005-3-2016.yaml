  content: "ISO/IEC 23005-3:2016 specifies syntax and semantics of description schemes
    and descriptors that represent sensory information. This international standard
    is applicable to enhance the experience of users while consuming media resources
    by stimulating human multi-sensor such as tactile, orfactory, light sense, temperature
    sense, etc.\nThe system architecture is depicted in Figure 1 and the scope of
    this Part of ISO/IEC 23005 is highlighted. That is, only the information representation
    that acts as an input to the possible Adaptation VR ? as defined in ISO/IEC 23005-1
    ? is specified in this Part of ISO/IEC 23005.\nThe adaptation engine for Sensory
    Information is to adapt Sensory information to Device Command which is the actual
    signal to control multi-sensory devices as defined in ISO/IEC 23005-5. This adaptation
    process is not mandatory incase the sensory information may directly control the
    actual devices. "
