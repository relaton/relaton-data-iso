  content: "The focus of ISO 16757 is the support of manufacturers to provide their
    product data in electronic product catalogues. \n\nThis part of the standard –
    ISO 16757 Part 5: Product catalogue exchange format - describes how product catalogue
    data is exchanged as IFC format according to ISO 16739-1 from manufacturers to
    designers of building services systems.\n\nWith ISO 16739-1 (IFC), an open language
    exists for the creation, transfer and maintenance of design models. \n\nprEN 17549-1
    and prEN 17549-2 define the data exchange of scalable product properties within
    IFC. These standards provide a Model View Definition (MVD), a subset of ISO 16739-1
    from an information technology perspective. It focuses on core classes and relies
    on external data dictionaries to describe business semantics.\n\nThis document
    completes the description of the IFC-based data exchange format for manufacturer
    catalogues by describing how to model:\n•\tCatalogue metadata\n•\tProduct classes
    \n•\tConstraints for parametric data\n•\tProduct accessory structures\n•\tConstraints
    for assembling composable products and accessories\n•\tReusable and multiply used
    data blocks\n•\tProduct properties as defined in the related library  \n•\tStatic
    product properties\n•\tDynamic computable properties\n•\tGeometric data of product
    spaces\n•\tGeometric data of product symbols\n•\tGeometric data of product shape\n•\tGeometric
    data of product ports\n•\tArticle numbers\n•\tEtc.\nThis document focuses only
    on the format of the data exchanged and not on how to process it. \n\nThis document
    is aimed at both software manufacturers for the construction sector and professionals
    in the sector who use their software."
