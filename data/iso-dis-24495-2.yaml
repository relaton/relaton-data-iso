abstract:
- content: "This proposed standard is for anybody who creates or help create legal
    and related documents. It builds, and relies, on the foundation for plain language
    in WD 24495-1, Plain Language — Part 1: Governing Principles and Guidelines.  This
    standard, Plain Language — Part 2 Legal Writing and Drafting, will add guidance
    and techniques to help authors make sure that people affected by legal and related
    documents can readily understand, exercise, and carry out their rights and responsibilities.\nWhen
    readers cannot find, understand, or use legal information in a document, the consequences
    can be devastating, even life-threatening. For individuals, the inability to understand
    legal information—to access justice—interferes with the most basic human rights:
    the ability to earn a living, obtain housing, make sound medical and financial
    decisions, pursue and defend legal rights, and more.  For governments and businesses,
    the problems of poor legal communication include increased costs, reduced efficiency,
    and reduced effectiveness and compliance.\nThe widest use of plain legal language
    is for governing documents, like legislation and regulations; documents that govern
    personal or organizational relationships, like financial, housing, and medical
    agreements; and documents that cover other relationships, like powers of attorney,
    wills, privacy policies, and terms of use. But the standard will also apply to
    other legal communications, like advice letters, judicial opinions, jury instructions,
    forms, human resources (and other) policies, contracts (whether the contract is
    between an individual and an organization, or between organizations). \nThe standard
    will explain how to apply principles from WD 24495-1 to legal situations that
    may require authors to \n•\treach multiple audiences, with vastly different needs;\n•\tadhere
    to specific structural and design requirements;\n•\texplain complex and nuanced
    legal concepts; and\n•\texplain unfamiliar processes that readers must navigate
    as they exercise rights or carry out legal responsibilities.\n\nAs is the case
    with Part 1, the aim is for the standard to work in most languages, in most sectors,
    and for most documents that communicate legal information. The standard will reflect
    the most recent research on plain legal language and the experience of plain-legal-language
    experts. To the extent possible, the standard will allow for differences due to
    different legal systems, for example systems based on British Common Law, French
    Civil Law, and South African Roman Law.\nThe standard’s guidelines are recommendations.
    They do not establish requirements. When localizing the standard, national standards
    bodies can adapt and expand the standard to achieve the goals of plain language
    in their own languages and in the context of their own legal systems.\nWhile this
    Standard covers the essential elements of plain legal language, it has some intentional
    limits:\n•\tIt does not cover all types of communication. It applies only to printed
    or digital information that is primarily in the form of text. However, creators
    of other types of communications, such as podcasts and videos, may find this standard
    useful.\n•\tIt does not include existing technical guidance about accessibility
    and digital documents, although this standard’s guidance can apply to both. For
    guidance on accessibility, authors of digital documents are urged to consider
    the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines and EN 301 549: Accessibility requirements
    for ICT products and services.\nLater Parts of this standard may provide case
    studies, best practices, and other supporting information."
