- content: |-
    This document specifies the capabilities of a tool to support review work.
    The evaluation and selection of the review tools are performed in accordance with ISO/IEC 20741 which defines the general evaluation selection process and evaluation characteristics. This document defines capabilities specific to review tools in the process. By using these two standards together, it is possible to derive objective and reasonable results of the evaluation and selection of review tools.
    The review work is based on the process, activities, and tasks defined in ISO/IEC 20246. It is also assumed that the review targets are defined in ISO/IEC 20246. The review work in this document is assumed not to be performed by a 3rd party, but within a project.
    The review tool capabilities specified in this document harmonize with the review process defined in ISO/IEC 20246. This document does not include automated process, activities, or tasks for conducting reviews such as automated source code checkers defined in ISO/IEC 30130.
    Issues which are identified in the review are recorded and managed by the tool; but defects found in tests and issues found in general except for reviews are out of the scope of this document.
