abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 18051:2012 specifies the Services and Event Reports for Computer-Supported
    Telecommunications Applications, Phase III (CSTA).\nIt is focused on providing
    application service interfaces to a Switching Function, Computing Function and
    a Special Resource Function. A CSTA application interface is disassociated from
    the various user-network interfaces and network-network interfaces CSTA applications
    serve, observe or manipulate. Because CSTA operates with existing telecommunications
    interfaces indirectly, it operates generically so that differences among various
    existing interfaces are hidden from CSTA applications. Support of user-to-network
    interfaces is outside the scope of CSTA. Although most terminal equipment (TE)
    is suitable for use with CSTA, there will be instances of TE that will not be
    suitable in certain circumstances. \nISO/IEC 18051:2012 defines services that
    allow functional integration between a computing network and a telecommunications
    network. Computing platforms (i.e., Application Programming Interfaces - APIs)
    that support such functionally-integrated applications are outside the scope of
    ISO/IEC 18051:2012. \nCommunication between the computing and switching (i.e.,
    telecommunications) networks can take place via intervening networks ranging from
    simple point-to-point connections to local- or wide-area telecommunications networks.
    \nISO/IEC 18051:2012 is part of a suite of CSTA Standards and Technical Reports
    that provides a comprehensive description of the architectural and practical issues
    involved in applying, implementing, and utilizing CSTA-based CTI applications."
