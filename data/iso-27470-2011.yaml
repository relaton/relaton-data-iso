    ISO 27470:2011 specifies the minimum functional, performance and safety requirements for a catering vehicle capable of transporting and loading/unloading in-flight service (catering) equipment and supplies into or from the upper deck of very large capacity aircraft, as well as the main deck of these or other aircraft types.
    The intent of ISO 27470:2011 is not to specify equipment design, but rather to define minimum functional and performance requirements and highlight those criteria which are known to be essential to an efficient and safe operation on civil transport aircraft in the environment of international airports.
    ISO 27470:2011 specifies the worldwide requirements recognized by aircraft and vehicle manufacturers as well as airlines and catering agencies. In addition, it shall be applied with due reference to the national governmental regulations of the country where the vehicle is to be operated. The main though not exclusive areas in which such national regulations may apply are: a) general requirements applicable to road vehicles; b) sanitary requirements regarding design, cleaning and disinfection of vehicles used to carry food for human consumption; c) stability and other safety requirements applicable to elevating equipment carrying personnel in the elevated position.
    Nothing in ISO 27470:2011, however, shall be deemed to supersede any locally applicable law or regulation, unless a specific exemption has been obtained for this purpose from the appropriate Authority.
    Certain requirements of ISO 27470:2011 are specifically dictated by overwing access to doors of certain aircraft types, and may not apply to other aircraft types. However, the intent of ISO 27470:2011 is that any upper deck catering vehicle shall be capable of safely handling this specific situation.
