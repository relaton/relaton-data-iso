    ISO 22966:2009 gives common requirements for the execution of concrete structures and applies to both in-situ works and construction using prefabricated concrete elements.
    ISO 22966:2009 requires that the execution specification state all the specific requirements relevant to the particular structure.
    ISO 22966:2009 is applicable to temporary as well as permanent concrete structures.
    Additional or different requirements can be considered and, if required, given in the execution specification when using lightweight aggregate concrete; other materials (e.g. fibres) or constituent materials; or special technologies/innovative designs.
    ISO 22966:2009 does not apply to the following: concrete members used only as equipment or construction aids for the execution; specification, production and conformity of concrete; production of precast concrete elements made in accordance with product standards; safety and health aspects of execution, or third-party safety requirements; contractual issues or responsibilities for the identified actions.
