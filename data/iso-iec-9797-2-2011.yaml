  content: "Message Authentication Code (MAC) algorithms are data integrity mechanisms
    that compute a short string (the Message Authentication Code or MAC) as a complex
    function of every bit of the data and of a secret key. Their main security property
    is unforgeability: someone who does not know the secret key should not be able
    to predict the MAC on any new data string. \nMAC algorithms can be used to provide
    data integrity. Their purpose is the detection of any unauthorized modification
    of the data such as deletion, insertion, or transportation of items within data.
    This includes both malicious and accidental modifications. MAC algorithms can
    also provide data origin authentication. This means that they can provide assurance
    that a message has been originated by an entity in possession of a specific secret
    key. \nISO/IEC 9797-2:2011 specifies three MAC algorithms that are based on a
    dedicated hash-function (selected from ISO/IEC 10118-3).\nISO/IEC 9797-2:2011
    specifies three MAC algorithms that use a secret key and a hash-function (or its
    round-function) with an n-bit result to calculate an m-bit MAC. \nThe strength
    of the data integrity mechanism and message authentication mechanism is dependent
    on the length (in bits) k and secrecy of the key, on the length (in bits) n of
    the hash-function and its strength, on the length (in bits) m of the MAC, and
    on the specific mechanism. \nThe first mechanism specified in ISO/IEC 9797-2:2011
    is commonly known as MDx-MAC. It calls the complete hash-function once, but it
    makes a small modification to the round-function by adding a key to the additive
    constants in the round-function. The second mechanism specified in ISO/IEC 9797-2:2011
    is commonly known as HMAC. It calls the complete hash-function twice. The third
    mechanism specified in ISO/IEC 9797-2:2011 is a variant of MDx-MAC that takes
    as input only short strings (at most 256 bits). It offers a higher performance
    for applications that work with short input strings only. "
