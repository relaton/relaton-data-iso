    This document provides a single, sector-specific management system standard that allows the implementation of a safety and sustainability management system for commercial shipping on inland waterways. The document is tailored towards navigation on the inland waterways, which include but not limited to rivers and lakes. It applies to freight, cruise, ferries and passenger vessels larger than 24 meters in length on the inland waterways and the land-based operation supporting the ship.
    Excluded from this document:
    This document is not applicable to sports or pleasure crafts for the purpose of recreation (ISO/TC 188 Small craft) or boats smaller than 24 meters in length and not for financial gain.
    This document does not replace or include requirements specific to other management system standards, such as those for quality (ISO 9001), occupational health and safety (ISO 45001), environment (ISO 14001), energy (ISO 50001) or risk management (ISO 31000).
