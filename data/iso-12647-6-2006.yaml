abstract:
- content: |-
    ISO 12647-6:2006 specifies a number of process parameters and their values to be applied to four-colour process printing by the flexographic printing process for packaging and publication, excluding newsprinting. The parameters and values are chosen in view of the complete process covering the process stages "colour separation", "film setting", "making of the printing forme", "proof production", "production printing" and "surface finishing". This covers printing on printing substrates which are nearly white or on films to which a white coating has been applied.
    ISO 12647-6:2006 is directly applicable to:
    - publication flexographic printing including magazines, catalogues and commercial materials, and packaging flexographic printing including labels, boxes and flexible packages;
    - half-tone and continuous tone proofing processes that predict the colorimetric results of flexograhic printing.
