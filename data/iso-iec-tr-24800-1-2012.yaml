  content: "ISO/IEC TR 24800-1:2012 provides a global view of the JPSearch framework
    and describes the overall search and management process. An abstract architecture
    for JPSearch is described, and its components and their roles are explicitly identified.
    This information aims to facilitate the understanding of the normative parts of
    JPSearch and the relationships among them. \nISO/IEC 24800 (JPSearch) provides
    a set of standardized interfaces for digital image management and retrieval systems.
    There are many systems which provide image search and retrieval functionality
    on computer desktops, on the World Wide Web, on imaging devices, and in other
    consumer and professional applications. Existing systems are implemented in a
    way that tightly couples many components of the search process. JPSearch provides
    an abstract framework search architecture that decouples the components of image
    search and provides a standard interface between these components. Thus, aligning
    image search system design to this standard framework facilitates the use and
    reuse of metadata, the use and reuse of profiles and ontologies to provide a common
    context for searching, and the provision of a common query language to easily
    search across multiple repositories with the same search semantics. Furthermore,
    using JPSearch allows image repositories to be independent of particular system
    implementations and for users to easily move or upgrade their image management
    applications or to move to a different device or upgrade to a new computer.\nJPSearch
    is designed as a multi-part specification. Three main processes are standardized
    in the specification: search and retrieval by ISO/IEC 24800-3 (query format),
    the creation or maintenance of metadata by ISO/IEC 24800-4 (file format for metadata
    embedded in image data) and the synchronization or migration of repositories by
    ISO/IEC 24800-5 (data interchange format between image repositories). On the other
    hand, ISO/IEC 24800-2 (registration, identification and management of schema and
    ontology) links all the other parts to a common metadata interoperability model,
    which plays a key role in ISO/IEC 24800. ISO/IEC TR 24800-1 (JPSearch overview)
    and ISO/IEC 24800-6 (reference software) are intended to help understanding and
    developing JPSearch compliant systems. \nISO/IEC TR 24800-1:2012 reflects the
    latest updates of ISO/IEC 24800-2, ISO/IEC 24800-3, ISO/IEC 24800-4 and ISO/IEC
    24800-5, and incorporates information about the new ISO/IEC 24800-6. "
