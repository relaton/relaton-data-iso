    ISO 18324:2016 specifies test procedures to measure natural frequencies, modal damping ratios and static deflection under a concentrated load of laboratory or field timber floors. These parameters have been found to correlate well with human perception to timber floor vibration response caused by human-induced excitation under normal use. It is intended that the test procedures can be applied in lieu of calculation to quantify some or all of the above parameters that are used to evaluate the vibrational serviceability of the test floor. The subsequent use of the measured parameters to evaluate vibrational serviceability is, however, outside the scope of this International Standard.
    ISO published a series of International Standards on the application of modal testing and analysis to determine natural frequencies, modal damping ratios, and other dynamic properties of a structure. For the measurement of dynamic parameters such as natural frequencies and modal damping ratios, modal testing is proposed in this International Standard. It is assumed that the test operators possess the required equipment and fundamental knowledge to perform such a test. The theory of modal testing and analysis has been well documented in Reference [4].
