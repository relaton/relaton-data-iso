abstract:
- content: Specifies geometrical tests for these boring machines for general purpose
    use and normal accuracy, gives the corresponding permissible deviations and furthermore
    the nomenclature appropriate to each part of the machine in English and French,
    and the equivalent terms in German, Italian and Swedish. It deals only with the
    verification of the accuracy of the machine. It does not apply to the testing
    of the running of the machine or to its characteristics which should generally
    be checked before the accuracy is tested. Does not impose any practical test.
