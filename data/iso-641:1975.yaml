abstract:
- content: The requirements deal with the geometric charateristics to ensure interchangeability.
    The dimensions of the joint-ground zone and the outer diameter of the tube connected
    to the joint are given in a table and illustrated in a drawing. In addition the
    surface finish is specified. A system of gauges (stell balls) for testing the
    ball cup is tabled. In the annex a method of testing the leakage including the
    apparatus is described.
