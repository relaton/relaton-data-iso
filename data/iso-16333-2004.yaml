abstract:
- content: ISO 16333:2004 specifies a tilt-table test method for estimating the steady-state
    rollover threshold of a heavy commercial vehicle or bus, i.e. the maximum lateral
    acceleration that the test vehicle could sustain in steady-state turning without
    rolling over. It is applicable to complete roll units/combinations of roll-coupled
    vehicle units -- e.g. single-unit vehicles, tractor-semitrailer combinations,
    articulated buses, full trailers, B-train combinations -- of commercial vehicles,
    commercial vehicle combinations, buses or articulated buses as defined in ISO
    3833, and under Categories M3, N2, N3, O3 and O4 of ECE and EC vehicle regulations
    (trucks and trailers with maximum weights above 3,5 t and buses and articulated
    buses with maximum weights above 5 t).
