abstract:
- content: ISO/TS 18667:2018 applies to the design, development, fabrication, test,
    and operation of commercial, civil, and military space and ground control systems,
    sites/facilities, services, equipment, and computer software. Criteria is provided
    for rating the capability of the entire SD&QA programme or an individual SD&QA
    process to identify, assess, and eliminate or mitigate risks that threaten safety
    or mission success. The predefined capability rating criteria define the sequence
    of activities necessary to achieve a measurable improvement in the effectiveness
    of SD&QA risk management by implementing it in stages. Organizations can evaluate
    their existing SD&QA programme against the criteria in this document to identify
    the activities that need to be added, deleted, or modified to achieve the desired
    technical risk management effort. The phrase "desired technical risk management
    effort" means the activities and resources used to identify, assess, and eliminate
    or mitigate technical risks are commensurate with the product's unit-value/criticality
    and systems engineering life cycle data content/maturity.
