abstract:
- content: |-
    ISO/IEC 24771:2009 defines a protocol for the physical layer (PHY) and the data link layer in order to construct a reliable and high-speed data transmission network between devices on industrial sites such as factories and plants. This network specification provides a standardized protocol to provide a framework for various industrial devices to establish a simple, low-cost, energy-efficient, and high-speed network between them. In order to fulfil the service requirements of the factories and large plants, this network specification is designed to enable devices to establish a network by themselves without the help of any infrastructure and to reliably exchange various kinds of data, including real-time audio and video data, between them. In addition to high transmission rates, Quality of Service (QoS) for multimedia data - such as video - is also provided.
    The devices mentioned in ISO/IEC 24771:2009 refer to equipment that can be used on industrial sites such as factories and automated assembly lines. Devices include PLC (Programmable Logic Controller), and CNC (Computerized Numerical Controller) and manufacturing robots. However, beyond such conventional devices, devices mentioned in this document include personal IT devices that workers may carry and use while working, including cellular phones, personal industrial digital assistants (PDA), and laptop PCs.
