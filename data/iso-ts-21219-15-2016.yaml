    ISO/TS 21219-15:2016 specifies the TPEG application: Traffic Event Compact (TEC). The TEC application has been specifically designed to support information about traffic events (e.g. road works, traffic jams). A specific form of traffic events are local hazard warnings which, being safety-related messages, are sent with high priority to warn a driver that may encounter dangerous situations (e.g. black-ice, accident beyond curves, obstacles on road, etc.) unexpectedly.
    Generally, the Traffic Event Compact application is designed to allow receivers to
    -      ensure travel safety for the driver,
    -      enable the calculation of alternative routes,
    -      avoid delays (e.g. traffic jams),
    -      warn the driver of obstructions on route, and
    -      provide the driver with information on infrastructural problems (e.g. closed petrol stations, non-functioning emergency telephones).
