    This document defines:
    —     communication modes for Near Field Communication Interface and Protocol 1 (NFCIP-1) using inductive coupled devices operating at the centre frequency of 13,56 MHz for interconnection of computer peripherals;
    —     both the active and the passive communication modes of NFCIP-1 to realize a communication network using Near Field Communication (NFC) devices for networked products and for consumer equipment;
    —     a transport protocol including protocol activation and data exchange methods.
    This document specifies:
    —     modulation schemes;
    —     codings;
    —     bit rates;
    —     frame format of the radio frequency (RF) interface;
    —     initialisation schemes and conditions required for data collision control during initialisation.
    Information interchange between systems is based on agreement between the interchange parties upon the interchange codes and the data structure.
