    This document specifies requirements for six types of wire-braid-reinforced hoses and hose assemblies of nominal size from 5 to 51. This document also specifies the hose of nominal size 63 for types 2SN and R2AT, and the hose of nominal size 76 for type 2SN.
    They are suitable for use with:
    —     oil-based hydraulic fluids HH, HL, HM, HR and HV as defined in ISO 6743‑4 at temperatures ranging from −40 °C to +100 °C;
    —     water-based fluids HFC, HFAE, HFAS and HFB as defined in ISO 6743‑4 at temperatures ranging from −40 °C to +70 °C;
    —     water at temperatures ranging from 0 °C to +70 °C.
    This document does not include requirements for end fittings. It is limited to requirements for hoses and hose assemblies.
    NOTE    It is the responsibility of the user, in consultation with the hose manufacturer, to establish the compatibility of the hose with the fluid to be used.
