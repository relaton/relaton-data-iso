    ISO 7176-14:2008 specifies requirements and associated test methods for the power and control systems of electrically powered wheelchairs and scooters. It sets safety and performance requirements that apply during normal use and some conditions of abuse and failure. It also specifies methods of measurement of the forces necessary to operate controls and sets limits on the forces needed for some operations.
    ISO 7176-14:2008 is applicable to electrically powered wheelchairs and scooters with a maximum speed no greater than 15 km/h intended to provide indoor and/or outdoor mobility for one disabled person whose mass lies in the range specified in ISO 7176-11.
