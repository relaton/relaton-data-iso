    This document provides injury risk curves to assess occupant protection in frontal impact using the 50th percentile THOR metric dummy (THOR-M 50).
    Injury risk curves developed specifically for the THOR dummy are chosen preferably, however, when not available, the applicability of the PMHS injury risk curve is evaluated with regard to the dummy biofidelity.
    Finally, when possible, a field evaluation is provided.
