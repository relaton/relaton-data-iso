abstract:
- content: 'This International Standard specifies requirements, test methods, and
    marking, labelling and packaging, as appropriate,of both permanent and temporary
    single-point anchor devices exclusively for the attachment of personalprotective
    equipment (PPE) for protection against falls from a height for fall arrest, work
    positioning and travelrestriction (work restraint).It is applicable only to anchor
    devices for PPEs that conform to ISO 10333-1, ISO 10333-2, ISO 10333-3 andISO
    10333-5.NOTE 1 Further standards are in preparation for other types of PPE: ISO
    10333-6 and ISO 14566 (see bibliography).Anchor devices are rated to sustain a
    maximum (dynamic) arresting force of 6,0 kN, and a maximum (static) loading of1,0
    kN (assuming a person of 100 kg mass) in post-fall arrest suspension, work-positioning
    mode, or restraint mode.Anchor devices are intended for single person use only.
    A rescuer should not attach to the same anchor device as aperson being rescued,
    unless the anchor device has been specifically designed for such purposes, and
    the instructionsfor use specifically permit this application.NOTE 2 Vertical rigid
    or flexible line systems and horizontal lifelines are not within the scope of
    this International Standard,but are covered in ISO 10333-4 and ISO 16024.'
