  content: |-
    ISO 10845-8:2011 establishes a key performance indicator, in the form of a contract participation goal (CPG), relating to the engagement of targeted labour on a contract for the provision of services or engineering and construction works. A CPG may be used to measure the outcomes of a contract in relation to the engagement of targeted labour or to establish a target level of performance for the contractor to achieve or exceed in the performance of a contract.
    ISO 10845-8:2011 sets out the methods by which the key performance indicator is measured, quantified and verified in the performance of the contract in respect of two different targeting strategies: targeting strategy A and targeting strategy B.
