    ISO/TR 23087:2018 is the reference framework for the Big Picture project.
    The Big Picture aims at monitoring the consistency of published standards and current or future standardization projects.
    The Big Picture enables the standardization stakeholders to identify, for each concerned standard or standardization project, the relevant characteristics related to the positioning and impact of the standard or standardization project in the industry.
    Although the Big Picture was designed initially for the universe of discourse of ISO/TC 184 and then IEC/TC 65, it applies to manufacturing in general.
