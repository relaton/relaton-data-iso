  content: This document defines the requirements of capabilities of build and deployment
    tools to support and automate build, package, and deployment work. This document
    is intended for use in evaluating and selecting build and deployment tools according
    to the procedures defined in ISO/IEC 20741. By using these two standards together,
    objective and rational results can be derived for the evaluation and selection
    of build and deployment tools. This document is independent of development methodologies
    and approaches (such as Waterfall, Agile, or DevOps).
