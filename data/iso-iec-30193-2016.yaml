  content: "ISO 30193:2016 specifies the mechanical, physical and optical characteristics
    of a 120 mm rewritable optical disk with a capacity of 100,0 Gbytes. It specifies
    the quality of the recorded and unrecorded signals, the format of the data and
    the recording method, thereby allowing for information interchange by means of
    such disks. User data can be written, read and overwritten many times using a
    reversible method. This disk is identified as a BD Rewritable disk.\nISO 30193:2016
    specifies the following:\n-      the one disk Type;\n-      the conditions for
    conformance;\n-      the environments in which the disk is to be operated and
    stored;\n-      the mechanical and physical characteristics of the disk, so as
    to provide mechanical interchange \nbetween data processing systems;\n-      the
    format of the information on the disk, including the physical disposition of the
    Tracks and Sectors;\n-      the error-correcting codes and the coding method used;\n-
    \     the characteristics of the signals recorded on the disk, enabling data processing
    systems to read \ndata from the disk.\nISO 30193:2016 provides for interchange
    of disks between disk drives. Together with a standard for volume and file structure,
    it provides for full data interchange between data processing systems."
