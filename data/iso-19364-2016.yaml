    ISO 19364:2016 specifies a method for comparing computer simulation results from a vehicle mathematical model to measured test data for an existing vehicle according to steady-state circular driving tests as specified in ISO 4138 or the Slowly Increasing Steer Test that is an alternative to ISO 4138. The comparison is made for the purpose of validating the simulation tool for this type of test when applied to variants of the tested vehicle.
    It is applicable to passenger cars as defined in ISO 3833.
    NOTE          The Slowly Increasing Steer method is described in regulations such as USA FMVSS 126 "Federal Register Vol 72, No. 66, April 6, 2007" and UN/ECE Regulation No. 13-H, "Uniform provisions concerning the approval of passenger cars with regard to braking".
