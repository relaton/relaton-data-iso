- content: |-
    ISO 11088:2015 specifies assembly, adjustment and inspection procedures for the binding mechanisms of skis, integrating in a practical way, the requirements of those International Standards which are related to skis, bindings and boots.
    It is intended for all individuals and institutions concerned with those procedures, and especially for sports retailers.
    It is applicable to a ski/binding/boot system (S-B-B) for alpine skiing, of which at least one component is owned by the user.
    NOTE          In the case where the two components (SB and B) are rented, ISO 13993 gives a method of measurement by sampling as an alternative to systematic measurement, before delivery to the end-user.
