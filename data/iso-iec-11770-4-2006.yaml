abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 11770-4:2006 defines key establishment mechanisms based on weak
    secrets, i.e., secrets that can be readily memorized by a human, and hence secrets
    that will be chosen from a relatively small set of possibilities. It specifies
    cryptographic techniques specifically designed to establish one or more secret
    keys based on a weak secret derived from a memorized password, while preventing
    off-line brute-force attacks associated with the weak secret. More specifically,
    these mechanisms are designed to achieve one of the following three goals.\n-
    Balanced password-authenticated key agreement: Establish one or more shared secret
    keys between two entities that share a common weak secret. In a balanced password-authenticated
    key agreement mechanism, the shared secret keys are the result of a data exchange
    between the two entities, the shared secret keys are established if and only if
    the two entities have used the same weak secret, and neither of the two entities
    can predetermine the values of the shared secret keys.\n- Augmented password-authenticated
    key agreement: Establish one or more shared secret keys between two entities A
    and B, where A has a weak secret and B has verification data derived from a one-way
    function of A's weak secret. In an augmented password-authenticated key agreement
    mechanism, the shared secret keys are the result of a data exchange between the
    two entities, the shared secret keys are established if and only if the two entities
    have used the weak secret and the corresponding verification data, and neither
    of the two entities can predetermine the values of the shared secret keys. \n-
    Password-authenticated key retrieval: Establish one or more secret keys for an
    entity, A, associated with another entity, B, where A has a weak secret and B
    has a strong secret associated with A's weak secret. In an authenticated key retrieval
    mechanism, the secret keys, retrievable by A (not necessarily derivable by B),
    are the result of a data exchange between the two entities, and the secret keys
    are established if and only if the two entities have used the weak secret and
    the associated strong secret. However, although B's strong secret is associated
    with A's weak secret, the strong secret does not (in itself) contain sufficient
    information to permit either the weak secret or the secret keys established in
    the mechanism to be determined."
