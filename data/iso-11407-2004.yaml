abstract:
- content: ISO 11407:2004 specifies the interchangeability requirements -- the various
    elements and dimensions -- for the mechanical coupling of towing vehicles whose
    coupling is mounted forward and below to centre-axle trailers. It is applicable
    to road trains for the commercial transport of low-density, high-volume cargo
    of the greatest possible variety. It is also applicable to corresponding equipment
    in cases where the same vehicle makes up part of a road train having more than
    one trailer. It is not applicable to dedicated or special combinations such as
    coupling systems with an extensible drawbar; nor does it specify limitations on
    maximum gross mass and overall dimensions, which are generally laid down by legislative
    requirements.
