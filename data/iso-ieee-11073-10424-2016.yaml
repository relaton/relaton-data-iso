abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: Within the context of the ISO/IEEE 11073 family of standards for device
    communication, a normative definition of the communication between sleep apnea
    breathing therapy equipment (SABTE) devices (agents) and managers (e.g., cell
    phones, personal computers, personal health appliances, set top boxes), in a manner
    that enables plug-and-play interoperability, is established in this standard.
    It leverages appropriate portions of existing standards including ISO/IEEE 11073
    terminology, information models, application profile standards, and transport
    standards. It specifies the use of specific term codes, formats, and behaviors
    in telehealth environments restricting optionality in base frameworks in favor
    of interoperability. This standard defines a common core of communication functionality
    for SABTE. In this context, SABTE is defined as a device that is intended to alleviate
    the symptoms of a patient who suffers from sleep apnea by delivering a therapeutic
    breathing pressure to the patient. SABTE is primarily used in the home health-care
    environment by a lay operator without direct professional supervision.
