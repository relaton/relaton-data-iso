    ISO 14825:2011 specifies the conceptual and logical data model and physical encoding formats for geographic databases for Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) applications and services. It includes a specification of potential contents of such databases (data dictionaries for Features, Attributes and Relationships), a specification of how these contents shall be represented, and of how relevant information about the database itself can be specified (metadata).
    The focus of ISO 14825:2011 is on ITS applications and services and it emphasizes road and road-related information. ITS applications and services, however, also require information in addition to road and road-related information.
    Typical ITS applications and services targeted by ISO 14825:2011 are in-vehicle or portable navigation systems, traffic management centres, or services linked with road management systems, including the public transport systems.
