abstract:
- content: ISO 25720:2009 is applicable to the data exchange format that is designed
    to facilitate the exchange of the genomic sequence variation data around the world,
    without forcing change of any database schema. From an informatics perspective,
    GSVML defines the data exchange format based on XML. The scope of ISO 25720:2009
    is the data exchange format, but the database schema itself is outside the scope
    of this International Standard. From a biological point of view, all genetic sequence
    variations are taken into consideration and are within the scope of this International
    Standard, while polymorphisms, especially SNP, are the main focus of this International
    Standard. In other words, the annotations of variation as clinical concerns and
    -omics concerns are within the scope of ISO 25720:2009. Though SNPs exist in various
    biological species, the scope of this International Standard covers the human
    health associated species as human, cell line, and preclinical animals. The other
    biological species are outside the scope of ISO 25720:2009. The clinical field
    is within the scope of this International Standard, but the basic research fields
    and other scientific fields are outside the scope of ISO 25720:2009. Here, clinical
    research including drug discovery is within the scope of this International Standard.
    As for supposed application fields, our main focus is in human health including
    clinical practice, preventive medicine, translational research and clinical researches.
