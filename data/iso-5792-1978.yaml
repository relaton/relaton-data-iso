  content: Describes a method applicable to products having aresenic contents equal
    to or greater than 0,1 mg/kg. As far as principle, the reagents and apparatus
    to be used are concerned, reference is made to ISO 2590, with some modifications
    added. For example, the reduction of arsenic by zinc is carried out in sulphuric
    acid medium. Provides information on the expression of results and the particulars
    to be included in the test report. The annex lists ISO publications covering the
    same subject.
