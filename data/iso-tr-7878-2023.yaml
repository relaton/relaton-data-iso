    This document describes the enterprise view (see ISO/TS 14812:2022, 3.1.4.3) of integrated mobility based on the role and responsibility models in the mobility as a service (MaaS) and mobility on demand (MOD) ecosystems as described in ISO/TR 4447. Other ISO documents (e.g. ISO 24014-1, ISO 17573-1 and ISO/TR 21724-1) have been reviewed in order to enhance and merge the MaaS and MOD role models.
    The enterprise view addresses the relationships between organizations and users, and the roles those entities play in the delivery and consumption of mobility services. Relationships between entities are dependent on the roles those entities take in the delivery of user services.
    Enterprise objects interact to exchange information, manage and operate systems beyond the scope of one organization. The enterprise view focuses on the relationships between those enterprise objects, but also defines how enterprise objects interact with physical objects, which appear in the enterprise view as "resources".
    This document focuses on mobility service concepts where the included transport services are publicly available. Examples of such transport services are listed in Clause 3.
