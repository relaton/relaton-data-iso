  content: The intent of ISO 18215:2015 is to provide guidance to ship design and
    operational personnel (crew) on the critical issues to consider regarding machinery,
    prior to and during vessel operations in the extreme conditions of the Earth's
    polar regions. This International Standard is intended to supplement the IMO Code
    for Ships Operating in Polar Waters and the IACS UR "I", Requirements Concerning
    Polar Class. Although the application of this International Standard is primarily
    concerned only for ships operating in polar regions, some of the design considerations
    and planning might need to be implemented during construction or in a shipyard
    environment.
