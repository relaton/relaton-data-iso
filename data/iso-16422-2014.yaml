    ISO 16422:2014 specifies the requirements of pipes and joints made of oriented unplasticized poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC-O), for piping systems intended to be used underground or above-ground where not exposed to direct sunlight, for water mains and services, pressurized sewer systems and irrigation systems.
    The piping system according to ISO 16422:2014 is intended for the conveyance of cold water under pressure, for drinking water and for general purposes up to and including 45 °C, and especially in those applications where special performance requirements are needed, such as impact loads and pressure fluctuations, up to pressure of 25 bars[1].
    Joints constructed of other materials should meet their own relevant standards in addition to the fitness-for-purpose requirements of ISO 16422:2014.
    [1]      1 bar = 0,1 MPa = 105 Pa; 1 MPa = 1 N/mm2
