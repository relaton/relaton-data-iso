    This document specifies a method for the determination of residual monomers and other (saturated) organic components in aqueous polymer dispersions and latices as well as in related products. It makes use of capillary-column gas chromatography with direct injection of the liquid sample.
    Residual monomers and saturated volatiles that have been successfully determined by this method include acrylic and methacrylic esters, acrylonitrile, butadiene, styrene, vinyl acetate, vinyl chloride as well as by-products such as acetaldehyde and ethylbenzene.
