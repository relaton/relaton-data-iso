    This document provides requirements for the icons that are suitable for setting up interaction modes in all kinds of devices. It gives guidance about their purpose, their function, and how they are designed in order to be usable.
    This document specifies two sets of icons:
    a)       icons that deal with global constraints that are taken into account by the product or service;
    b)       icons that are oriented to more specific functions.
    Each icon is illustrated through a glyph, name, description and function.
