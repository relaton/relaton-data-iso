    This document specifies the general, technical and management requirements for water reuse of circulating cooling water in thermal power plants.
    This document covers the control parameters of typical water reuse treatment processes of circulating cooling water in thermal power plants, excluding the processes with few application cases in circulating water treatment or the unmatured.
    This document provides technical guidance for planners, managers, technical consultants, designers and operators of water treatment systems involved in circulating cooling water treatment project of thermal power plant.
    This document is applicable to the water reuse technical schemes selection and operation parameter control of circulating cooling water in thermal power plants.
    This document is applicable to circulating cooling thermal power plants fueled by coal, oil, natural gas and biomass.
