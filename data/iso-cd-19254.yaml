abstract:
- content: This standard is intended for the simultaneous analysis of multi-class
    pesticide residues in soil using GC-MS/MS and LC-MS/MS analysis following the
    extraction with buffering salts mixture and clean up with the dispersive-soild
    phase extraction(d-SPE). The number of target analytes is 30(16 of fungicides,
    6 of herbicides and 8 of insecticides). This document can be applied to other
    pesticide residues if its validity is verified. Under the conditions specified
    in this document, limit of detection as low as 0.05 mg/kg(expressed as dry matter)
    can be achieved depending on the target analytes.
