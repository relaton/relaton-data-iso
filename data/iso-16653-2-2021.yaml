    This document specifies the design, calculations, safety requirements and test methods for mobile elevating work platforms (MEWPs) with non-conductive (insulating) components. It is intended to be used in conjunction with ISO 16368.
    It is applicable to all types and sizes of MEWPs with non-conductive (insulating) components, including dielectric components designed and tested to meet the specific electrical properties consistent with the manufacturer's identification plate. This equipment is intended to move persons, tools and equipment to working positions where they can carry out work from a work platform located above a non-conductive (insulating) boom section.
    This document covers structural design calculations and the application of stability criteria, construction, safety examinations and tests done before MEWPs with non-conductive (insulating) components are first put into service. Annex A identifies the hazards arising from the use of MEWPs with non-conductive (insulating) components and describes methods for the elimination or reduction of these hazards.
    MEWPs covered in this document are not intended to have any of their components make contact with live parts of electrical installations. The electrical properties of a MEWP's non-conducting (insulating) components can provide electrical protection in case of inadvertent contact above the non-conductive boom component at the platform end. If a MEWP is equipped with a chassis insulating system, it can provide electrical protection for ground personnel in case of inadvertent contact above that system.
    This document is not applicable to MEWPs designed for or capable of operating in live working conditions (see IEC 61057). The electrical insulation level is limited to voltages experienced in electrical distribution systems 46 kV and below.
