abstract:
- content: Specifies the constructional requirements of portable, mobile and fixed
    apparatus for industrial radiography of category I (sealed source not removed
    for exposure) and II (sealed source projected out of the container by an operator
    at a distance). Operational usage of exposure containers is not covered. As the
    transport of apparatus is concerned, the requirements of the relevant transport
    regulations have also to be satisfied.
