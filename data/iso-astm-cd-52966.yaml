    This document defines a standardized framework for implementing a level system for temporarily self-sufficient systems in additive manufacturing. It defines principles, criteria, and provides guidance for categorizing additive manufacturing processes and technologies into different levels to support self-sufficient systems such as ships, oilrigs and assembly teams in the field or remote research stations.

    It aims to provide clarity and consistency for non-AM-experts dealing with logistical support of self-sufficient systems.

    This document is applicable to industries, military institutions, research institutions, and regulatory bodies involved in additive manufacturing, facilitating interoperability and harmonization of practices across different stakeholders
