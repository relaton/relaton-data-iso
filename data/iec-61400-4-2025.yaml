abstract:
- content: "This document is applicable to enclosed speed increasing gearboxes for
    horizontal axis wind turbine drivetrains with a power rating in excess of 500
    kW. This document applies to newly designed gearboxes for wind turbines installed
    onshore or offshore. The technical requirements given in this document are not
    intended for repaired or refurbished gearboxes, or for the extension of the service
    life beyond the design life.\nThis document provides requirements and guidance
    on the analysis of the wind turbine loads in relation to the design of the gear
    and gearbox elements. The gearing elements covered by this document include such
    gears as spur, helical or double helical and their combinations in parallel and
    epicyclic arrangements in the main power path. This document does not apply to
    power take off (PTO) gears.\nThis document includes requirements, design recommendations,
    and rating of gearboxes with rolling bearings, plain bearings, or combinations
    of both bearing types.\nAlso included are requirements and guidance on the engineering
    of shafts, shaft hub interfaces, lubrication, wind turbine controller interface,
    and the gear case structure to achieve a design that is capable of withstanding
    the environment and operating conditions of a wind turbine. Requirements for dynamic
    analysis of the gearbox within the wind turbine system are specified for the purpose
    of identifying load levels exceeding the predictions of the global aeroelastic
    simulation. The analysis of noise transmission and emission (e.g. tonal emission
    at gear mesh frequencies) is not within the scope of this edition of the document.\nFurther,
    this document provides requirements and guidance on gearbox design verification,
    prototype testing and production testing, as well as consideration of design for
    service and maintenance. \nA method for a systematic assessment of the design
    reliability of a gearbox design under reference operating conditions is specified
    in IEC TS 61400‑4-1[1].\nThis document is supported by two Technical Reports:
    IEC TR 61400‑4-2[2] provides additional information on lubrication of wind turbine
    drivetrains and IEC TR 61400‑4-3[3] contains explanatory notes and supportive
    information to the requirements specified in this document."
