    This document specifies the minimum requirements for the material, design construction and workmanship, manufacturing processes, examination and testing at time of manufacture of an assembly of permanently mounted composite tube(s) in a frame with associated components.
    Tubes covered by the requirements of this document are:
    a)    of composite construction, permanently mounted in a transport frame and suitable for specified service conditions, designated as:
    b)    with water capacities from 450 l up to and including 10 000 l;
    c)    containing compressed gases but excluding:
    d)    with working pressure up to 1 000 bar.
    This document does not address tubes with working pressure times water capacity (p × V) more than 3 000 000 bar∙l.
