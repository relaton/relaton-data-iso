abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: This document specifies an in situ method for the determination of the
    density of solid particles or liquid droplets (herein referred to as "particle")
    dispersed in liquid continuous phase. The method is based on direct experimental
    determination of particle velocity in these liquids or media in gravitational
    or centrifugal fields based on Stokes law. The particle density is calculated
    from experimentally determined particle velocities in different liquids or media,
    taking into account their dynamic viscosities and densities, respectively. The
    approach does not require the knowledge of particle size distribution but assumes
    that sedimentation relevant characteristics (e.g. volume, shape, agglomeration
    state) do not change. This document does not consider polydispersity with regard
    to particle density, i.e. all particles are assumed to be of the same material
    composition.
