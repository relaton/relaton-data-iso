    This document specifies the testing method for the determination of the bonding strength of ceramic coatings at ambient temperature by the compression tests on the cross-joined test pieces. Methods for test piece preparation, test mode and rate, data collection and reporting procedures are addressed.
    This document applies primarily to any ceramic coatings, thick or thin, bonded onto substrates of various materials. The test method described can be used for materials research, quality control, characterization and design data generation purposes.
