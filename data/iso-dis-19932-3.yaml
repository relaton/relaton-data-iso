abstract:
- content: This document specifies the requirements and test methods for inspection
    of the use of knapsack sprayers carried on the back or shoulder of the operator
    for use with plant protection products (PPPs). The requirements relate mainly
    to the condition of the sprayer with respect to its potential risk to the operator
    and the environment and its performance to achieve good application. It is applicable
    to lever-operated knapsack sprayers, knapsack compression sprayers and knapsack
    sprayers driven by an engine or electric motor using hydraulic pressure atomisation
    of the spray liquid, intended for use primarily in agriculture, forestry and horticulture,
    with a nominal volume of more than 6,0 l. This document does not apply to — knapsack
    combustion engine-driven air-blast sprayers, which are covered in ISO 28139 —
    controlled droplet application equipment utilizing rotary atomisers, or — portable
    application equipment for spatial application (such as foggers).
