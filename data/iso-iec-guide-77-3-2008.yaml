  content: "ISO/IEC Guide 77-3:2008 provides general advice and guidance for the description
    of products and their characteristics by the use of ISO 13584 and IEC 61360 for
    the creation of computer processable product libraries, catalogues and reference
    dictionaries. This description will provide the details of the products and their
    properties in an unambiguous manner, capable of computer communication in a form
    that is independent of any proprietary application software. The term “product”
    is taken to include devices, processes, systems, installations, etc. ISO/IEC Guide
    77-3:2008 is intended to assist in the objective of enabling the flow of technical
    information between internal and external business partners in a cost effective
    and timely manner.\nThe guidance in ISO/IEC Guide 77-3:2008 is intended to assist
    the following groups:\n-        convenors and members of ISO technical committees;\n-
    \       technical experts contributing their knowledge to the development of reference
    dictionaries, data bases and product libraries;\n-        information experts
    responsible for the generation of applications of ISO 13584, particularly related
    to standardized reference dictionaries;\n-        managers and technical experts
    in the manufacturing industry.\nISO/IEC Guide 77-3:2008 is intended to provide
    practical information of the experience gained in the creation of product reference
    dictionaries within ISO and IEC. ISO/IEC Guide 77-3:2008 is intended for information
    only, in areas such as education.\nThe following are within the scope of ISO/IEC
    Guide 77-3:2008:\n-        experience of developing a reference dictionary for
    cutting tools;\n-        experience of developing a reference dictionary for electronic
    components;\n-        experience of creating a system for the maintenance of a
    reference dictionary for measuring instruments; \n-        experience of developing
    a reference dictionary for fasteners.\nThe following are outside the scope of
    ISO/IEC Guide 77-3:2008:\n-        an overview for ISO technical committees and
    industrial managers for the development of computer-processable product libraries,
    reference dictionaries and catalogues;\n-        technical guidance for the creation
