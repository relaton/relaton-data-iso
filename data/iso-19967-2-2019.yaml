    This document specifies test conditions and test procedures for determining the performance characteristics of air source heat pump water heaters for space heating with electrically driven compressors with or without supplementary heater. The purpose of this document is to rate the performance of the heat pump water heaters for space heating with no operation of any supplementary heater. In the case of heat pump water heaters for space heating consisting of several parts with refrigerant or water connections, this document applies only to those designed and supplied as a complete package.
    NOTE       Testing procedures for simultaneous operation for hot water supply and space heating are not treated in this document. Simultaneous means that hot water supply and space heating generation occur at the same time and can interact.
