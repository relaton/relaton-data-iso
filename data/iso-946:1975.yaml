  content: Specifies requirements for the determination of the impact strength. The
    test consists in breaking a series of unnotched machined cylindrical test pieces
    resting freely between supports, and measuring the difference between the kinetic
    energy of the hammer before and after fracture of the test piece. Annex A includes
    non-standard test pieces, annex B includes notes on coefficients for calculation
    of impact strength.
