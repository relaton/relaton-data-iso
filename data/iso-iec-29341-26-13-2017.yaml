  content: "ISO/IEC 29341-26-13:2017 specifies the PhoneManagement profile of the
    ConfigurationManagement Service defined in [7]. \nThe PhoneManagement profile
    can be used for managing the configuration of the UPnP TelephonyServer device
    (i.e. a telephone), with tasks such as managing an address book, configuring the
    settings of the phone, configuring the ringing modes, checking the battery level
    of the phone. This profile is compliant with the UPnP Telephony Architecture defined
    in [9]. \nPhoneManagement defines\n-           A profile of the CMS in order to
    satisfy the requirements for PhoneManagement (see clause 5).\n-           The
    Phone Data Model to perform configuration management of the specific features
    of a phone (see Annex A) by reusing the CMS data model (see [7], Annex B).\nThe
    ConfigurationManagement service offers a general purpose data model and a set
    of configuration management operations for retrieving and managing the actual
    configuration parameters of a device. These features are completely reused from
    CMS in the PhoneManagement. \nThe ConfigurationManagement service defines the
    functions for manipulating the configuration and status parameters that are exposed
    by the device hosting the ConfigurationManagement service. These actions and state
    variables defined in the ConfigurationManagement service are reused in order to
    manage the configuration parameters of a TelephonyServer device for e.g. phone,
    defined in the data model of the PhoneManagement. \nThe main goal of this specification
    is to define the data model (called herein as Phone Data Model) for the TelephonyServer
    device like Phone, according to the rules defined by the ConfigurationManagement
    service for defining a new data model.  \nThe Phone Data Model is organized as
    a hierarchical tree of parameter sets, where each set represent a feature of a
    TelephonyServer  (e.g. address book, ringing modes etc) that can be managed by
    a TelCP."
