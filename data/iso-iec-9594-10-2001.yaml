abstract:
- content: |-
    The Directory may support open systems applications such as message handling systems, File Transfer, Access and Management (FTAM) systems, and transaction processing systems. Therefore, the Directory system may be manageable from an integrated system management platform.
    This purpose of Directory management is to assure that needed, accurate Directory information is available to users as scheduled with the expected response time, integrity, security and level of consistency. Furthermore, systems management may be accomplished with the minimum burden on processing time and memory on platforms and the communications system.
    ISO/IEC 9594-10:2001 describes the requirements for Directory management, and analyses these requirements to identify those that may be realized by OSI Systems Management services (and protocols), those that are realized by Directory services (and protocols), and those that are realized by local means.
