abstract:
- content: "ISO/TS 10303-1612:2006 specifies the application module for AP210 device
    functional and physical characterization. \nISO/TS 10303-1612:2006 deals with
    the representation of device functional and physical characterization. Device
    data includes the following information: \n- device black box model, \n- package
    data, \n- functional data, \n- environmental constraints, \n- performance data,
    \n- simulation models.\nFormal encapsulation of external data type definitions
    is made for parametric data and analysis models. Pin mapping is provided to ensure
    consistency between device views. Shape, material, technology, tolerance on shape
    and on parameters, units are included. Shapes included may be categorized according
    to discipline (e.g. thermal analysis, vibration analysis) and analysis environment
    (e.g. design, assembly, end-user). Geometric dimensioning and tolerancing is included.
    The functional data includes two distinct data sets:\n- hierarchical functional
    decomposition into behavioural elements embedded in a network represented at each
    level by a nodal formulation, and\n- pin mapping of the terminals of the top level
    functional definition to the physical terminals of the device.\nConfiguration
    management information and design change management information is provided. This
    data includes at least one geometric representation. \nThe following are within
    the scope of ISO/TS 10303-1612:2006:\n- black box models; \n- pin mapping between
    functional and physical view; \n- mapping to simulation model; \n- classification
    of shape purposes for black box models; \n- nodal based behavioural representation. "
