  content: The proposed document provides the life cycle management of concrete structures
    particularly focusing on the structural planning and design stage on the basis
    of the framework and general principles specified by ISO 22040, Life cycle management.  This
    document is applicable to not only newly constructed structures but also existing
    structures when their life cycle is restarted.  This document specifies on how
    performance requirements should be considered at the planning and design stage
    and also how the basic LCM scenario should be drawn up.  Management items at the
    design stage are clearly defined and information that may be fed back to the planning
    stage and be transferred to the execution stage is described.
