    This document specifies a method for the determination of the mass concentration of particulate arsenic and arsenic compounds in workplace air sampled on a filter (e. g. 37 mm cellulose nitrate filter), digested with acid or an acid mixture and analysed quantitively by using electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry (ET-AAS). The method is not suitable for determination of arsenic in the form of metal arsenides, which decompose in the presence of water or acid, or for arsenic trioxide vapour.
    Many different types of sampling apparatus are used to collect respirable or inhalable dust, according to the occupational hygiene convention. This document is designed to accommodate the variety of samplers and collection substrates available to analysts. This document is intended to be used in conjunction with ISO 21832 which promotes best practices for these analyses.
    The method is applicable to the determination of masses of approximately 0,2 µg to 2 μg of arsenic per sample, for analysis of test solutions prepared using sample solution aliquots in the recommended range (see 10.1.3 and 10.1.4.1). The concentration range for arsenic in air, for which this procedure is applicable, is determined in part by the sampling procedure selected by the user.
    The method is applicable to personal and stationary air sampling.
    A number of transition metals can interfere with the determination of arsenic by electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry (see 11.3).
