    This part of ISO/IEC 14543 presents methods for overall building management of the home
    electronic system (HES) architecture. The interaction of building and home control systems
    requires a demarcation between building manager versus tenant responsibilities. A method for
    implementing agreements between building managers and tenants regarding user access to
    and control of applications via a firewall is specified.
    This technical report augments series ISO/IEC 14543, the architecture of HES (Home
    Electronic System), in order to accommodate both home and building automation in a mixeduse
    building. Both systems may coexist in a building with shops, offices and apartments. Some
    systems are applicable to the whole building versus the systems which are applicable to
    individual apartments and offices only. In some cases these systems need to interact.
    This technical report proposes a logical model for linking building and home control systems
    even if the two use different physical arrangements of components. The basic recommendations
    are:
    allow for distinct and separate building and home automation control systems, possibly
    supplied by different manufacturers;
    define clear points of connection between building and home control systems;
    limit the number of points of connection between building and home control systems,
    preferably to one per home system;
    accommodate systems that provide building tenants with user control of local systems. This
    favors an architecture where products can be designed for the user to override control
    decisions within parameters agreed with building management. Such actions are exercised
    by the building automation system and affect local systems. This enhances user safety and
    user privacy;
    provide seamless links between systems that are based on different architectures, that
    incorporate different communications protocols, and that may be purchased from different
    manufacturers.
