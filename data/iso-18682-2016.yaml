    ISO 18682:2016 specifies basic requirements for systems to execute notifications such as warning and awareness messages to provide hazard information to a driver.
    Requirements include principle of notifying, timing of notification, distance of notification, and information elements that should be included in messages.
    NOTE 1       Methods of implementing functions such as hazardous conditions detection, communication, and presentation to drivers are not specified in this document.
    NOTE 2       The formulae in Clause 5 and calculated concrete time or distance duration in Annex A are not normative elements but informative elements.
