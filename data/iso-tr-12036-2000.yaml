    This Technical Report applies to the removal and destruction of images from microforms when document
    expungement is ordered. It also applies to the revision of image content when an order requires the deletion,
    correction or amendment of specific information. It establishes proper procedures for image removal or revision and
    for documenting these actions to ensure file integrity.
    These guidelines cover techniques for removing information from microforms. If followed, they should enable the
    user to adequately meet an expungement request.
