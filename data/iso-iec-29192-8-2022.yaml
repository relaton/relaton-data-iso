abstract:
- content: |-
    This document specifies one method for authenticated encryption suitable for applications requiring lightweight cryptographic mechanisms.
    This method processes a data string with the following security objectives:
    a) data confidentiality, i.e. protection against unauthorized disclosure of data,
    b) data integrity, i.e. protection that enables the recipient of data to verify that it has not been modified.
    Optionally, this method can provide data origin authentication, i.e. protection that enables the recipient of data to verify the identity of the data originator.
    The method specified in this document is based on a lightweight stream cipher, and requires the parties of the protected data to share a secret key for this algorithm. Key management is outside the scope of this document.
    NOTE      Key management techniques are defined in the ISO/IEC 11770 series.
