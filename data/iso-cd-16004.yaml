    ISO 16004:2017 specifies dimensional interface and unobstructed space requirements applicable to the aircraft mating section of either
    a) passenger boarding bridges, or
    b) passenger transfer vehicles
    used at airports for boarding and disembarkation of passengers on the types of civil transport aircraft which have been listed hereafter. These types of aircraft have a door sill height greater than 2,0 m (80 in) over the ground. Lower aircraft usually do not require such means of access, and have not been taken into account.
