abstract:
- content: Gives a method for the determination of this quantity of transparent and
    light-coloured hydrocarbon liquids such as are used in capacitors, transformers,
    circuit breakers and in cables of the oil-filled type. This method is applicable
    to liquids having indices in the range 1,33 to 1,7 and at temperatures of 20 to
    30 degrees centigrade. It is not applicable, within the accuracy stated of liquids
    having bubble points so close to the test temperature that a reading cannot be
    obtained before substantial deterioration takes place.
