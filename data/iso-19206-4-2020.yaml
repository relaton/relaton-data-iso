    This document specifies the properties and performance requirements of a bicyclist target (BT) that represents a human bicyclist in terms of shape, movement, reflection properties, etc. for testing purposes. The BT is used to assess the system detection and activation performance of active safety systems.
    This document establishes the detection requirements for a BT in terms of sensing technologies commonly in use at the time of publication of this document, and where possible, anticipated future sensing technologies. It also establishes methodologies to verify the target response properties to these sensors, as well as some performance requirements for the target carrier.
    The BT according to this document is also representative for electrically assisted pedal bicycles (pedal electric cycle, pedelec).
    This document does not address the test procedures in terms of speeds, positions, or timing of events. Performance criteria for the active safety system being tested are also not addressed.
