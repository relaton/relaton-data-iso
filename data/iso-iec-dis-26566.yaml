abstract:
- content: "This document, within the context of methods’ and tools’ capability for
    supporting product line texture:\n— defines processes for product line texture
    management, operationalization, and support; those processes are described in
    terms of purpose, inputs, tasks, and outcomes;\n— defines method capabilities
    to support the defined tasks of each process;\n— defines tool capabilities that
    automate or semi-automate tasks and methods.\n\nThis document does not concern
    the processes and capabilities of tools and methods for a single system \nbut
    rather deals with those for a family of products."
