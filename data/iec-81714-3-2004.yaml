  script: Latn
  content: This part of IEC 81714 specifies requirements concerning the classification
    of connect nodes assigned to graphical symbols, being a representation of functional
    and product concepts. Due to the strong interrelation between the product and
    its corresponding graphical representation, identical classification principles
    are applied for both the classification of connect nodes of products as well as
    for the classification of networks and their representation by graphical symbols
    in computer-aided systems
