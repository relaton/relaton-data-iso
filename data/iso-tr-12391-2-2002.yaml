    This part of ISO/TR 12391 is a summary and compilation of the test results obtained during the development
    of the "Flawed-Cylinder Burst Test". The concept and development of the flawed cylinder burst test is
    described in ISO/TR 12391-1. The test is a method for evaluating the fracture performance of steel cylinders
    that are used to transport high pressure, compressed gases. In this part of ISO/TR 12391, test results are
    reported for several hundred flawed cylinder burst tests that were conducted on seamless steel cylinders
    ranging in tensile strength from less than 750 MPa up to about 1 400 MPa.
    This test method has been shown to reliably predict the fracture performance of seamless steel cylinders. The
    test method is intended to be used both for the selection of materials and design parameters in the
    development of new cylinder designs as well as for an efficient quality control test to be used during the
    production of cylinders.
