  content: "This proposed deliverable specifies an annotation scheme for semantic
    information relating to quantification in natural language. Quantification occurs
    whenever a predicate is applied to sets of arguments (rather than to single arguments)
    and gives rise to (among other things) questions of relative scope, distributivity,
    determinacy, and cardinality of collections of arguments. These issues make quantification
    a major source of ambiguity. \nThe application of a predicate to sets of arguments
    occurs in two major positions in natural language: (a) in a main clause, when
    a verb is combined with its arguments, and (b) in a noun phrase, when a head noun
    is modified by adjectives, other nouns, prepositional phrases, possessive phrases,
    or relative clauses. The proposal specifies for both positions how the semantically
    relevant quantification aspects can be annotated, and provides a semantics for
    the annotations based on a combination of the theory of generalized quantifiers,
    Discourse Representation Theory, and event semantics."
