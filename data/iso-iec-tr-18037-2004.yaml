    ISO/IEC TR 18037:2004 specifies a series of extensions of the programming language C (as specified by ISO/IEC 9899:1999) to support features commonly found in embedded processors.
    ISO/IEC TR 18037:2004 deals with the following topics: extensions to support fixed-point arithmetic, named address spaces, and basic I/O hardware addressing. Each topic begins with a technical description of its features and ends with the editorial changes to ISO/IEC 9899:1999 necessary to fully specify the topic, and thereby provides a complete definition. Additional explanation and rationale are provided in annexes.
