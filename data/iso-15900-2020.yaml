abstract:
- content: |-
    This document provides guidelines and requirements for the determination of aerosol particle number size distribution by means of the analysis of electrical mobility of aerosol particles. This measurement is usually called "differential electrical mobility analysis for aerosol particles". This analytical method is applicable to particle size measurements ranging from approximately 1 nm to 1 µm. This document does not address the specific instrument design or the specific requirements of particle size distribution measurements for different applications but includes the calculation method of uncertainty. In this document, the complete system for carrying out differential electrical mobility analysis is referred to as DMAS (differential mobility analysing system), while the element within this system that classifies the particles according to their electrical mobility is referred to as DEMC (differential electrical mobility classifier).
    NOTE    This document does not include technical requirements and specifications for the application of DMAS, which are defined in application specific standards or guidelines, e.g. for road vehicle applications (ISO/TC 22), environmental measurements (ISO/TC 146) or nanotechnologies (ISO/TC 229).
