    This document gives the safety requirements and measures for stationary:
    — cold presses;
    — hot presses;
    — bending presses;
    — edge/face gluing presses;
    — membrane presses;
    — embossing presses;
    where the pressing force is applied by hydraulic actuators pushing two flat or shaped surfaces against each other, capable of continuous production use, hereinafter referred to as "machines".
    It deals with all significant hazards, hazardous situations and events as listed in Annex A, relevant to machines, when operated, adjusted and maintained as intended and under the conditions foreseen by the manufacturer, including reasonably foreseeable misuse. Also, transport, assembly, dismantling, disabling and scrapping phases are taken into account.
    It is also applicable to machines fitted with one or more of the following devices/additional working units, whose hazards have been dealt with:
    a) device for hot gluing;
    b) device for high-frequency gluing;
    c) device for high-frequency shaping;
    d) automatic workpiece loading and unloading system;
    e) intermediate additional platens;
    f) workpiece extractor;
    g) workpiece clamping pressure beam;
    h) split moveable platens.
    The machines are designed to process workpieces consisting of:
    1) solid wood;
    2) materials with similar characteristics to wood (see ISO 19085 1:2021, 3.2);
    3) honeycomb board.
    This document does not deal with any hazards related to:
    — specific devices that differ from the list above;
    — hot fluid heating systems internal to the machine other than electrical;
    — any hot fluid heating systems external to the machine;
    — operation of taking intermediate platens out and in again;
    — the combination of a single machine being used with any other machine (as part of a line).
    It is not applicable to:
    — frame presses;
    — membrane presses where the pressing force is applied by vacuum only;
    — presses for producing chipboard, fibreboard, OSB;
    — machines intended for use in potentially explosive atmosphere;
    — machines manufactured before the date of its publication as an international standard.
