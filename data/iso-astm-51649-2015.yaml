abstract:
- content: |-
    ISO/ASTM 51649:2015 outlines dosimetric procedures to be followed in installation qualification (IQ), operational qualification (OQ) and performance qualifications (PQ), and routine processing at electron beam facilities.
    The electron beam energy range covered in this practice is between 300 keV and 25 MeV, although there are some discussions for other energies.
    Dosimetry is only one component of a total quality assurance program for adherence to good manufacturing practices used in radiation processing applications. Other measures besides dosimetry may be required for specific applications such as health care product sterilization and food preservation.
    ISO/ASTM 51649:2015 is one of a set of standards that provides recommendations for properly implementing and utilizing dosimetry in radiation processing. It is intended to be read in conjunction with ISO/ASTM 52628, "Practice for Dosimetry in Radiation Processing".
