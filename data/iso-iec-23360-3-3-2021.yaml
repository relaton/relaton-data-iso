abstract:
- content: 'This document defines a system interface for compiled applications and
    a minimal environment for support of installation scripts. Its purpose is to enable
    a uniform industry standard environment for high-volume applications conforming
    to the LSB. These specifications are composed of two basic parts: a common part
    describing those parts of the interface that remain constant across all implementations
    of the LSB, and an architecture-specific part describing the parts of the interface
    that vary by processor architecture. Together, the common part and the relevant
    architecture-specific part for a single hardware architecture provide a complete
    interface specification for compiled application programs on systems that share
    a common hardware architecture. The LSB contains both a set of Application Program
    Interfaces (APIs) and Application Binary Interfaces (ABIs). APIs may appear in
    the source code of portable applications, while the compiled binary of that application
    may use the larger set of ABIs. A conforming implementation provides all of the
    ABIs listed here. The compilation system may replace (e.g. by macro definition)
    certain APIs with calls to one or more of the underlying binary interfaces, and
    may insert calls to binary interfaces as needed. The LSB is primarily a binary
    interface definition. Not all of the source level APIs available to applications
    may be contained in this specification. This is the Itanium™ architecture specific
    part of the Desktop module of the Linux Standard Base (LSB). This part supplements
    the common part of the LSB Desktop module with those interfaces that differ between
    architectures. This part should be used in conjunction with the common part of
    LSB Desktop. Whenever a section of the common part is supplemented by architecture-specific
    information, the common part includes a reference to the architecture-specific
    part. This part may also contain additional information that is not referenced
    in the common part. Interfaces described in this part of LSB Desktop are mandatory
    except where explicitly listed otherwise. Interfaces described in the LSB Desktop
    module supplement those described in the LSB Core module. They do not depend on
    other LSB modules. '
