    ISO/IEC TS 33030:2017 contains an exemplar documented assessment process, and serves as guidance on the nature of activities required by this document. The content of this exemplar contains the minimum elements of a documented assessment process applicable for performing all classes of assessments as defined in ISO/IEC 33002. See also Annex B.
    ISO/IEC TS 33030:2017 is suitable for all classes of assessments defined in ISO/IEC 33002.
    This exemplar includes the activities by describing the tasks, inputs, outputs and the assessment-related roles and responsibilities. This description implicitly contains other elements that could comprise the process, like purpose, initial/end conditions, additional supporting roles/responsibilities or necessary resources.
    While this exemplar contains all of the activities that are considered to be required for a process assessment, it is the case that variation exists in individual process assessments, and therefore, some degree of tailoring of this assessment process could be required. Tailoring of the assessment process is permitted, though it is the responsibility of the Lead Assessor and it would need to be conformant to the requirements of ISO/IEC 33002.
    ISO/IEC TS 33030:2017 is not intended for use in performing organizational maturity assessments.
