    This document specifies a service architecture that defines the framework and domain for classification of probe vehicle systems (PVS), which are systems that collect probe data from private vehicles and that process the probe data statistically towards useful information that finally can be provided to end users.
    This document focuses on services that can be developed using public sector probe data that are generated by vehicles. It specifies the following items related to PVS:
    —     service framework of probe vehicle systems;
    —     definition of service domain of PVS.
