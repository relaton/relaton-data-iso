    This document specifies minimum requirements to support accurate measurement of optical signals in photometric methods used for qualitative or quantitative characterization of biological samples.
    This document is applicable to optical signals that are generated, for example, by bioluminescence, chemiluminescence and fluorescence, and optical signals that are detected as changes of light due to absorption.
    This document addresses the verification of optical signal measurement instruments used in photometric methods for measurement of biological samples including considerations for the use of optical references.
    This document does not provide sector- or application-specific performance criteria for the workflow of measuring biological samples. When applicable, users can also consult existing sector- or application- specific standards, or both.
