abstract:
- content: "This document gives guidelines for the establishment, and maintenance
    of the seismometer system as a part of the infrastructures for DRR in smart community
    infrastructures. The seismometer system in this document are for use in disasters
    induced by earthquakes and volcanic tremors. \nThis document shows examples on
    how different types of seismometer can be utilized to meet the needs and expectations
    of users and helps planners, developers, and operators of communities to properly
    and effectively use seismometers and its data for disaster risk reduction.\nThis
    document does not address how to design and develop seismometer systems."
