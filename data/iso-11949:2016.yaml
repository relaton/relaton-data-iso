    ISO 11949:2016 specifies requirements for single and double cold-reduced low-carbon mild steel electrolytic tinplate in the form of sheets or coils.
    Single cold-reduced tinplate is generally specified in nominal thicknesses that are multiples of 0,005 mm, from 0,150 mm up to and including 0,600 mm. Double cold-reduced tinplate is generally specified in nominal thicknesses that are multiples of 0,005 mm, from 0,100 mm up to and including 0,360 mm.
    ISO 11949:2016 applies to coils and sheets cut from coils in nominal minimum rolling widths of 600 mm.[1]
    [1] Nominal minimum rolling widths of 500 mm may be applied by agreement between the purchaser and the manufacturer.
