abstract:
- content: |-
    This document describes the principles and methods for evaluating the performance of density separation equipment used for coal cleaning operations. Testing and sampling procedures are specified, and methods of presenting test results are detailed. Performance parameters are recommended and defined, and their determination is formulated, thereby permitting their use in evaluating, comparing and predicting performance levels of coal cleaning operations.
    This document is applicable to the following types of coal cleaning equipment using relative density (RD) as the main characteristic for separation:
    a) dense-medium separators;
    b) jigs;
    c) other density-based separators, including spiral separator, hindered settling cleaners, shaking table, water-only cyclone, etc.
