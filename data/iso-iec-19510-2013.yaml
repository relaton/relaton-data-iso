    The primary goal of ISO/IEC 19510:2013 is to provide a notation that is readily understandable by all business users, from the business analysts that create the initial drafts of the processes, to the technical developers responsible for implementing the technology that will perform those processes, and finally, to the business people who will manage and monitor those processes. Thus, ISO/IEC 19510:2013 creates a standardized bridge for the gap between the business process design and process implementation.
    ISO/IEC 19510:2013 represents the amalgamation of best practices within the business modelling community to define the notation and semantics of Collaboration diagrams, Process diagrams, and Choreography diagrams. The intent of ISO/IEC 19510:2013 is to standardize a business process model and notation in the face of many different modelling notations and viewpoints. In doing so, ISO/IEC 19510:2013 will provide a simple means of communicating process information to other business users, process implementers, customers, and suppliers.
    ISO/IEC 19510:2013 is identical to OMG BPMN 2.0.1.
