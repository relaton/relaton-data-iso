    This document provides technical requirements and test methods for small unmanned aircraft electric energy systems (EESs).
    This document applies to the EES of small unmanned aircrafts (UAs) with the maximum take-off mass (MTOM) less than 25 kg corresponding to unmanned aircraft systems (UASs) at level I, II, III and IV as graded in ISO 21895:2020, and with secondary lithium batteries. This document can apply to new type of batteries to be used in the UA electric energy system in the future.
