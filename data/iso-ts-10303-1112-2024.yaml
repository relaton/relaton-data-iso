    ISO/TS 10303-1112 specifies the application module for Specification control.
    The following are within the scope of ISO/TS 10303-1112:
    - product classes used to identify sets of similar products to be offered to the market;
    - specifications used to describe characteristics of the products;
    - specification categories used to group similar characteristics of the products;
    - specification expressions used to control the usage of a part within a product and to represent conditions for product classes;
    - product functions used to describe the functional requirements for products and components of products;
    - product components used to describe the common decomposition structure of all products of a product class or of various alternative solutions;
    - alternative solutions used to describe the variants for a product component or for a product function;
    - item instances used to identify an occurrence of a component in an assembly structure;
    EXAMPLE 1   An item instance could identify the elements of an alternative solution.

    - configurations used to link the parts (item instances), alternative solutions, product components, or product functions with their usage cases;
    EXAMPLE 2   An usage case is the the conditions under which configurations are used.

    - product specifications are used to identify a manufacturable product out of a product class by its specific characteristics (specifications);
    EXAMPLE 3   A customer order for a piece of furniture is a product identification.

    - items within the scope of application module Alternative solution, ISO/TS 10303-1109;
    - items within the scope of application module Part collection, ISO/TS 10303-1115;
    - items within the scope of application module Product placement, ISO/TS 10303-1343;
    - items within the scope of application module Requirement view definition, ISO/TS 10303-1141;
    - items within the scope of application module Specification based configuration, ISO/TS 10303-1108.
