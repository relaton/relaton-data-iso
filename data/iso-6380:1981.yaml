  script: Latn
  content: Covers a method based on the selection of a gas chromatography column allowing
    the separation of the impurities to be determined. A gaseous test portion is passed
    through this column and the peaks obtained are detected by flame ionization and
    compared with those derived from an external standard. Uses two types of columns,
    one for the determination of methane, ethane and acetylene (adsorption chromatography)
    and the other for the determination of the other impurities (gas/liquid partition
    chromatography).
