- content: |-
    The lifecycle processes described in the ISO/IEC 29110 series are not intended to preclude or discourage their use by organisations bigger than VSEs. This document applies for the development of non safety critical products.
    The ISO/IEC 29110–4-6  will identify the requirements applicable to the tasks and work products described in this document.

    This document is targeted for VSEs that do not develop safety critical products and have little or no experience with systems engineering (SE) process planning and implementation using the ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288. This document is also targeted for VSEs which are familiar with the management and engineering guide of the systems engineering Intermediate profile (ISO/IEC TR 29110 5-6-3) for their system development projects and are involved in the development of more than one project in parallel with more than one work team. This document is intended to be used with any process, technique and method that enhances the VSE’s stakeholder satisfaction and productivity.
