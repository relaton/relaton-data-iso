    ISO 28522:2009 provides guidance for assembly and flushing of hydraulic oil systems. The aim of the flushing process is twofold:
    - to remove dirt from the erection, installation, and
    - to demonstrate that the pipes and the system as a whole are sufficiently clean.
    ISO 28522:2009 gives guidelines to ensure that pipes and components are mounted and tested correctly. It also gives practical conditions for the flushing oil and filter.
