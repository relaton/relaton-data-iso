abstract:
- content: Specifies the conditions for carrying out the tests as well as recommendations
    for the evaluation of the results. Unless otherwise agreed, the tests are of the
    fluctuating tension type and are carried out at room temperature. The influence
    of the compliance of clamped parts on the strain of the fastener is not taken
    into account. The test results can be influenced by the test conditions. For this
    reason, minimum requirements are specified to reduce this effect. In addition,
    calibration and centring control methods for the testing apparatus are included.
