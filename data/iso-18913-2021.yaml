    This document establishes a vocabulary of terms and definitions used in respect of the permanence of imaging materials, related storage materials and digital storage media.
    In most cases these terms and definitions are generic and are applicable to the entire imaging industry. For terms and definitions specific to particular applications, refer to industry standards. However, in some cases the definition of a term is still evolving and/or is used by different user groups in different ways. In this case a definition fit for use in Imaging Materials – Permanence work is given and a note to this effect is included.
