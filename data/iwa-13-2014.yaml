    IWA 13:2014 serves as the basis for a multiple-resource productivity analysis, providing a means to identify and evaluate scalable resource solutions that can be categorized as multiple-resource productivity (MRP) solutions. MRP solutions are defined as solutions that can produce at least two MRP resources (water, energy, food/cropland) without consuming the other resources.
    This standardized framework includes a guideline for the creation of a quantitative evaluation method for assessing a solution's feasibility and conducting economic cost-benefits analysis of various MRP solutions.
