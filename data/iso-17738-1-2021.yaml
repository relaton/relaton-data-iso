    This document outlines requirements for exterior insulation and finish systems (EIFS), used in combination with a drained air space as an exterior wall cladding system. The document includes requirements for a water resistive barrier assembly that are used as part of EIFS.
    This document outlines testing procedures with pass/fail criteria for an exterior insulation and finish system. The procedures cover the liquid applied water resistive barrier, which forms a second line of defense against water penetration, individual material components and the complete system to demonstrate durability.
    The use of mechanical fasteners is outside the scope of this document.
    In EIFS, the thermal insulation boards support the base coat with integral glass fibre reinforcing mesh. Systems where the reinforcement is the supporting element of the rendering, e.g. conventional stucco, are not covered by this document.
