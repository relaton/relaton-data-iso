abstract:
- content: ISO/TS 29585:2010 has three sections, 1) general considerations of design
    and deployment, 2) data aggregation and data modelling and 3) architecture and
    technology, and is intended to provide an overall set of guidelines for clinical
    data warehouse deployment supported by useful descriptions concerning different
    data aggregation and modelling approaches as well as particular aspects of information
    architecture that contribute to successful deployment. The first section is of
    particular interest to healthcare decision-makers, including information technology
    managers, of requirements and procedures that support successful clinical data
    warehouse deployment. The second section supports the understanding, choice, instigation
    and evaluation of methods that ensure reliable selection and aggregation of primary
    data for adequate compilation and presentation to support decisions – this section
    is of particular interest to statisticians, epidemiologists, healthcare evaluation
    specialists and others. Section three is of particular interest to informaticians
    concerned with efficient architectures, data mining methods, dynamic data querying
    and visualization for clinical data warehouses.
