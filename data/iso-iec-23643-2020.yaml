    This document specifies requirements for the vendors and gives guidelines for both the users and the developers of software safety and security verification tools. The users of such tools include, but are not limited to, bodies performing verification and software developers who need to be aware and pay attention to safety and/or security of software. This document guides the verification tool vendors to provide as high-quality products as possible and helps the users to understand the capabilities and characteristics of verification tools.
    This document introduces use cases for software safety and security verification tools and entity relationship model related to them. This document also introduces tool categories for software safety and security verification tools and gives category specific guidance and requirements for the tool vendors and developers.
