    ISO/IEC TR 15938-11:2005 contains the actual schema in XSD form for each of the ISO/IEC 15938-9 standard description profiles, namely the Simple Metadata Profile (SMP), User Description Profile (UDP), and the Core Description Profile (CDP) as describe below:
    - Simple Metadata Profile (SMP) -- describes simple metadata tagging for single instances of multimedia clips. This profile can be used in areas such as music, images and mobile applications, just to name a few.
    - User Description Profile (UDP) -- describes the personal preferences and usage patterns of users of multimedia content. Descriptions of users' preferences enable automatic discovery, selection and recommendation or recording of multimedia content. Preferences can be automatically inferred from the user's prior viewing and listening habits, which can in turn be derived from a usage history. The goal is to support improved usability of a variety of multimedia devices through personalization: personalized multimedia services offered to the consumer, personalized multimedia content discovery, filtering and selection and personalized consumption of multimedia content.
    - Core Description Profile (CDP) -- describes general multimedia content such as images, videos, audio and collections. Furthermore, content collections spanning various media types can also be described. As such, this profile provides a core set of tools that can be used to describe common multimedia content for a broad range of applications, such as general multimedia creation, consumption, distribution, broadcast television programming and educational courseware, just to name a few.
