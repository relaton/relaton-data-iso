    This document defines the requirements of the basic role and functional model of service applications for the introduction of low-speed automated driving system (LSADS) services including infrastructure facilities for supporting mobility in urban and rural areas.
    This document covers services using LSADS-equipped vehicles only; in-vehicle control systems are outside the scope.
    Examples of infrastructure facilities and road furniture include driving monitoring platforms, emergency response platforms, operation management platforms, user service platforms (e.g. for online reservations and online payments) and platforms for supporting automated driving systems.
