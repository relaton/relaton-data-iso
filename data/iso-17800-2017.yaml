  content: "ISO 17800:2017 provides the basis for common information exchange between
    control systems and end use devices found in single - and multi-family homes,
    commercial and institutional buildings, and industrial facilities that is independent
    of the communication protocol in use. It provides a common basis for electrical
    energy consumers to describe, manage, and communicate about electrical energy
    consumption and forecasts.\nISO 17800:2017 defines a comprehensive set of data
    objects and actions that support a wide range of energy management applications
    and electrical service provider interactions including:\na)     on-site generation,\nb)
    \    demand response,\nc)     electrical storage,\nd)     peak demand management,\ne)
    \    forward power usage estimation,\nf)      load shedding capability estimation,\ng)
    \    end load monitoring (sub metering),\nh)     power quality of service monitoring,
    \ni)      utilization of historical energy consumption data, and\nj)      direct
    load control."
