- content: "ISO/TS 10303-1293:2005 specifies the application module for AP239 part
    definition information, in particular:\n- representation of the data that identify
    parts and their versions;\n- representation of characterization views of a version
    of a part;\n- representation of parts, their versions, their definitions, and
    their management information, such as dates, that are assigned to them;\n- representation
