    This document is a summary of the results of a questionnaire survey, which was conducted to gather information on the current state of performance-based fire safety design (P-B FSD) practices in various countries.
    The questions include what types of buildings and areas of fire safety systems are being applied, what are the legislative environments in terms of acceptance of P-B FSD, and what documents are needed/desired from ISO/TC 92/SC 4 if the countries/regions wish to adopt P-B FSD.
