    This document defines how to access resources on a web-services interface of an offering party using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS). Resources can be accessed through request/reply and/or requested to be pushed.
    The Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural pattern is chosen as a common way to format resource paths both for request/reply and push. Some specific extensions to this pattern are defined to allow for asynchronous resource requests, such as, for example, forcing readouts of data from a connected vehicle.
