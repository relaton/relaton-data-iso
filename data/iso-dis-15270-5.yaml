  content: "This document establishes the terms, definitions, methodologies, and calculations
    that are necessary for the recovery of waste from plastic products and materials
    labelled as industrially compostable (hereafter referred to as compostable plastic
    waste) through organic recycling. The document identifies the different types
    of organic recycling technologies used in the recovery and subsequent recycling
    of industrially compostable plastics waste arising from pre-consumer and post-consumer
    sources. This document also establishes the requirements and calculations to be
    considered in evaluating organic recycling inputs and outputs and determining
    output classifications for the recycling operation and the downstream integration
    points. \nThe document also outlines general quality requirements to be applied
    in all steps of the recovery process, and provides general recommendations for
    inclusion in material standards, test standards and product specifications. The
    process stages, requirements, recommendations, and terminology presented in this
    document are intended to be of general applicability. \nThis document does not
    establish test methods and criteria for the definition of the organic recyclability
    (e.g. compostability) of plastic materials and products. \nThis document refers
    to plastic waste deriving from products that have been classified as suitable
    for recovery through organic recycling by the relevant reference standards (e.g.,
    ISO 17088, ISO 18606) and therefore labelled as industrially compostable. These
    products are generally called “industrially compostable” (e.g. compostable bag,
    compostable tableware) meaning “suitable for organic recycling”, independently
    of the final treatment technology (whether it is true aerobic composting, or a
    combination of anaerobic digestion and composting, or only anaerobic digestion).\nThis
    document does not address home composting because this gardening practice cannot
    be classified as recycling."
