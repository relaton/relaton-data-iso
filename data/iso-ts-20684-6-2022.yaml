abstract:
- content: |-
    Field devices are a key component in intelligent transport systems (ITS). Field devices include traffic signals, message signs, weather stations, traffic sensors, roadside equipment for connected ITS (C-ITS) environments, etc.
    Field devices often need to exchange information with other external entities (managers). Field devices can be quite complex, necessitating the standardization of many data concepts for exchange. As such, the ISO 20684 series is divided several individual parts.
    This document specifies the user needs, requirements and design elements that are used to issue an SNMP set-request in response to a trigger firing. This allows a manager to configure the field device to implement simple responses to conditions in the field.
    NOTE 1    There are similarities between certain portions of the Event MIB defined in IETF RFC 2981 and this document.
    NOTE 2    ISO 20684-1 provides additional details about how the ISO 20684 series relates to the overall ITS architecture.
