    This document specifies the syntax, description and resolution functional components of the digital object identifier system. It specifies the general principles for the creation, registration and administration of DOI names (where DOI is an initialism for “digital object identifier”).
    This document defines the syntax for a DOI name, which is used for the identification of an object of any material form (digital or physical) or an abstraction (such as a textual work) where there is a functional need to distinguish it from other objects.
    The DOI name does not replace, nor is it an alternative for, an identifier used in another scheme, such as the schemes defined by ISO/TC 46/SC 9. This document describes how the DOI system can be used in conjunction with another identifier scheme (for example, to provide additional functionality, such as resolution, where this is not already available), and how the character string of that other scheme can be integrated into the DOI system through the DOI metadata record or the DOI syntax or both.
    This document does not specify particular technologies to implement the syntax, description and resolution functional components of the digital object identifier system.
