abstract:
- content: ISO 18405:2017 defines terms and expressions used in the field of underwater
    acoustics, including natural, biological and anthropogenic (i.e. man-made) sound.
    It includes the generation, propagation and reception of underwater sound and
    its scattering, including reflection, in the underwater environment including
    the seabed (or sea bottom), sea surface and biological organisms. It also includes
    all aspects of the effects of underwater sound on the underwater environment,
    humans and aquatic life. The properties of underwater acoustical systems are excluded.
