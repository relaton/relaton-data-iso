    This document provides specifications for natural rubber latex concentrate which has low protein content [low protein natural rubber (LPNR) latex], as follows:
    —    LPNR latex: field latex or concentrated latex pretreated with deproteinising agent, centrifuged and preserved after concentration with ammonia only, with an alkalinity of at least a mass fraction of 0,6 % calculated with respect to the latex.
    This document is applicable to medical rubber products and avoids the possibility of allergies.
    This document covers requirements for LPNR latex, type HA (high ammonia), and LPNR latex, type LA (low ammonia).
