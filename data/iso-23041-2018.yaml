abstract:
- content: ISO 23041:2018 establishes standards, current guidelines and uniform procedures
    to minimize duplication of effort between the customer, the agency, participating
    nations and the emerging commercial space community. This document provides recommended
    practices for the development of space operations and support documentation, which
    should facilitate the sharing and exchange of beneficial information between organizations
    involved with space operations. This document establishes a common interface to
    simplify space operations planning and reduce the effort needed to learn and work
    with new space programmes and support organizations.
