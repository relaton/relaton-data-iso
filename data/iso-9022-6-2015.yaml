    ISO 9022-6:2015 specifies the methods relating to the environmental tests of optical instruments including additional assemblies from other fields (e.g. mechanical, chemical, and electronic devices), under equivalent conditions, for their ability to resist the influence of blowing dust.
    The purpose of testing is to investigate to what extent the optical, climatic, mechanical, chemical, and electrical (including electrostatic) performance characteristics of the specimen are affected by blowing dust, especially with a view to malfunctions of moving parts (such as sliding surfaces, bearings, contacts, operating controls, gears) or unacceptable wear of surfaces.
    This test is not intended to determine the wear resistance to coarse dust.
