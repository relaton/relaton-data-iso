abstract:
- content: "This document provides requirements for metallic mounting kits for part-turn
    valves and actuator attachments.\nIt includes all components transmitting torques
    from actuators to valves with a maximum flange torque up to 16 000 Nm (up to F30
    flange type).\nIt applies to mounting kits for part-turn valves and actuators
    with integral attachment flanges and drive components as described in ISO 5211,
    when direct mounting of the actuator on valve is not practical. \nStacking of
    mounting kits/intermediate supports is not within the scope of this document.\nThis
    document specifies methods for design and environmental corrosion protection.\nWhen
    a reference is made to this document, all the requirements apply, unless otherwise
    agreed between the purchaser and the manufacturer/supplier, prior to order.\nIn
    this document, the term \"valve\" covers valve or shaft extension top-flange,
    and the term “actuator” covers part-turn actuator or combination of multi-turn
    actuator and gearbox.\nControl valves are excluded from this document."
