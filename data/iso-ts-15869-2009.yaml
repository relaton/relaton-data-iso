    ISO 15869:2009 specifies the requirements for lightweight refillable fuel tanks intended for the on-board storage of high-pressure compressed gaseous hydrogen or hydrogen blends on land vehicles.
    It is not intended as a specification for fuel tanks used for solid, liquid hydrogen or hybrid cryogenic high-pressure hydrogen storage applications.
    ISO 15869:2009 is applicable for fuel tanks of steel, stainless steel, aluminium or non-metallic construction material, using any design or method of manufacture suitable for its specified service conditions.
    ISO 15869:2009 applies to the following types of fuel tank designs:
    - Type 1: metal fuel tanks;
    - Type 2: hoop-wrapped composite fuel tanks with a metal liner;
    - Type 3: fully wrapped composite fuel tanks with a metal liner;
    - Type 4: fully wrapped composite fuel tanks with no metal liner.
