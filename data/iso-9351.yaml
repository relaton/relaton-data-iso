  content: "The proposed Standard, based upon a revised and updated EN 12496: 2013
    will specify the minimum requirements and give recommendations for the chemical
    composition, the electrochemical properties, the physical tolerances, and the
    test and inspection procedures for cast galvanic anodes of aluminium, magnesium
    and zinc alloys for cathodic protection in sea water and saline mud. \nThe Standard
    will be applicable to the majority of galvanic anodes used for seawater and saline
    mud applications, i.e. cast anodes of trapezoidal, \"D\", or circular cross section
    and bracelet type anodes.\nThe general requirements and recommendations of this
    proposed Standard may also be applied to other anode shapes, e.g. half-spherical,
    button, etc., which are sometimes used for seawater applications.\nApplications
    for this Standard are in offshore renewables, flood defences, offshore oil and
    gas, offshore or submarine pipelines, ports and harbours, ships and all applications
    in which galvanic anodes are used for cathodic protection in sea water and saline
    muds. \nWork is proposed to be undertaken in parallel between ISO TC 156 WG 10
    and CEN TC 219 WG3, under ISO lead in accordance with the Vienna Convention. This
    scope is agreed in principle by both parties."
