    ISO 18437-1:2012 establishes the principles underlying ISO 18437-2 to ISO 18437-5 for the determination of the dynamic mechanical properties (i.e. elastic modulus, shear modulus, bulk modulus, loss factor, and Poisson ratio) of isotropic visco-elastic resilient materials used in vibration isolators from laboratory measurements. It also provides assistance in the selection of the appropriate part of this International Standard.
    ISO 18437-1:2012 is applicable to isotropic resilient materials that are used in vibration isolators in order to reduce: a) the transmissions of audio frequency vibrations to a structure that can, for example, radiate fluid-borne sound (airborne, structure-borne or other); b) the transmission of low frequency vibrations which can, for example, act upon humans or cause damage to structures or sensitive equipment when the vibration is too severe; c) the transmission of shock and noise.
    The data obtained with the measurement methods that are outlined in ISO 18437-1:2012 and further specified in ISO 18437-2 to ISO 18437-5 can be used for: 1) the design of efficient vibration isolators; 2) the selection of an optimum resilient material for a given design; 3) the theoretical computation of the transfer of vibrations through vibration isolators; 4) information during product development; 5) product information provided by manufacturers and suppliers; 6) quality control.
