abstract:
- content: The scope of this document encompasses design parameters of external visual
    communication used by single mode L4/L5 automated driving system-dedicated vehicles
    (ADS-DVs), as defined in SAE J3016. Guidance is given for passenger cars (including
    sport utility vehicles and light trucks) and commercial vehicles (including heavy
    trucks and buses), as well as derivatives of them that carry or do not carry compartments
    for occupants (i.e. driver or passengers). These vehicles can be operated in different
    domains, covering several alternative scenarios and use cases (e.g. open roads,
    motorways, urban environments, confined areas, geo-fenced areas with dedicated
    lanes, ports, terminals, pits). It is assumed that the design of ADS-DVs will
    be unique, thus making it readily apparent that the vehicle is an ADS-DV (see
    also Annex A for descriptions of use cases concerning the need for communication).
    The wide range of domains makes it important to consider users with different
    experiences and abilities, e.g. experienced and inexperienced drivers, elderly,
    people with disabilities and children.
