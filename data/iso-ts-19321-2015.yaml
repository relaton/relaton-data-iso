    ISO/TS 19321:2015 specifies the in-vehicle information (IVI) data structures that are required by different ITS services (for example, refer to ISO/TS 17425 and ISO/TS 17426) for exchanging information between ITS Stations. A general, extensible data structure is specified (see Clause 5). This is split into structures called containers to accommodate current-day information (see Clause 6). Transmitted information includes IVI such as contextual speed, road works warnings, vehicle restrictions, lane restrictions, road hazards warnings, location-based services, re-routing, etc. The information in the containers is organized in sub-structures called data frames and data elements which are described in terms of its content (see Clause 7) and its syntax (see Annex A).
    The data structures are specified as communications agnostic. This Technical Specification does not provide the communication protocols. This Technical Specification then provides scenarios for usage of the data structure, e.g. in case of real time, short-range communications.
