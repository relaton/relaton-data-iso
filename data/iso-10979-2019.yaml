    This document specifies requirements for the unique identification of fuel assemblies utilized in nuclear power plants. It was developed primarily for commercial light-water reactor fuel, but can be used for any reactor fuel contained in discrete fuel assemblies that can be identified with an identification code as specified by this document.
    This document defines the characters and proposed sequence to be used in assigning identification to the fuel assemblies. The identification is intended to be borne by the fuel assembly throughout its lifetime.
    This document aims at providing an organizing principle for fuel assembly identification systems in order to guarantee unequivocal identification at any time and any place in the world (see also IAEA Safety Guide No. GS-G-3.5).
    Considering that existing standards for fuel assembly identification (such as ANSI/ANS-57.8-1995, DIN 25433, IAEA Safety Guide No. GS-G-3.5) ensure unequivocal identification in their respective fields of application, this document allows without restriction the further application of these standards. Moreover, it is intended that this document be used as a guideline for new definitions of identification systems.
