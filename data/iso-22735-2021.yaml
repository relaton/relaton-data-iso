    This document specifies test methods and performance metrics to evaluate the behaviour of a vehicle equipped with lane keeping assistance system (LKAS, see 3.2).
    For this purpose, variables relevant to vehicle dynamics as well as controllability of a vehicle with LKAS and their measurement methods are defined.
    A system requiring a driver intervention is excluded from the scope. This document applies to the vehicles of M1 category.
