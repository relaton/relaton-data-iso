abstract:
- content: "ISO 1503:2008 sets out design principles, procedures, requirements and
    recommendations for the spatial orientation and direction of movement of controls
    and displays used in tool machines, industrial robots, office machines, earth‑moving
    machinery, transportation (automobiles, railway electric cars/rolling stock, aircraft,
    ships, etc.), information, daily commodities, public utilities and the operational
    components of building facilities. \nIt lays down basic requirements for determining
    the operating direction of controls and the moving directions or changing states
    of the target object, as well as other relations."
