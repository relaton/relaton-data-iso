    ISO 13584-511:2006 specifies a reference dictionary for representing fasteners with their properties and domains of values, as they are described in the various ISO mechanical fastener standards. These fasteners include bolts, screws, nuts, rivets, pins, washers etc.
    The reference dictionaries series of parts of ISO 13584 specify ontologies for representing the entities of an application domain, together with their descriptive properties and domains of values. Each entity, property or domain of values constitutes an entry of a dictionary that is the formal and computer sensible representation of the specified ontology. It is associated with a computer sensible and human readable definition, and with a computer sensible identification.
    Identification of a dictionary entry allows for unambiguous reference from any application. Definitions and identifications of dictionary entries consist of instances of the EXPRESS entity data types defined in the common dictionary schema, or in its extensions defined in the logical series of parts of ISO 13584.
