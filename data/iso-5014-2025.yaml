    This document specifies a method for the determination of the modulus of rupture of dense and insulating shaped refractory products at ambient temperature, under conditions of a constant rate of increase of stress.
    Shaped refractories are those which have fixed geometry and dimensions when delivered to the user. This document is accordingly applicable to standard shape refractory bricks, but also special shapes refractory products and pre-cast products.
    This document is also applicable to unshaped refractories (see ISO 1927-6) after preparation of test specimens according to ISO 1927-5.
