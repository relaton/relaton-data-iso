    This International Standard establishes an approach for sampling and empirical measurement of soft-bottom
    impacts from marine finfish net pen farms, and gives examples of detailed procedures for how environmental
    impacts from finfish net pen farm sites can be monitored in the field, including guidelines for quality assurance
    of sampling protocols and safety. The emphasis of the environmental impact in this International Standard is
    on eutrophication effects on the seabed.
    This International Standard identifies ecological objectives, the indicators used, and the methodology and
    design, and encompasses guidelines for quality assurance of sampling protocols and operational safety.
