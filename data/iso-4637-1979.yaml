  content: Only suitable when the material to be tested is substantially uniform in
    thickness and flat or sufficiently flexible to remain flat in case of slight compression.
    Particularly suitable for materials having a very thin rubber layer which are
    difficult to test by stripping or peeling methods. However, it should be noted
    that the results obtained by this method will not necessarily correlate with those
    obtained by a stripping test. A figure shows the prepartion of test assembly.
