- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: Specifies a method, the principle of which consists in breaking down a
    sample by a high velocity jet of air in a small fluidized bed, calculating the
    amount of breakdown (attrition) from the change in particle size distribution
    of the test portion before and after fluidization, and expressing the degree of
    attrition as the increase in the percentage of material which passes through a
    screen of aperture size 150 um.
