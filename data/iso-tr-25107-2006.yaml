  content: ISO/TR 25107:2005 gives guidelines for non-destructive testing (NDT) training
    syllabuses, with the intention of harmonising and maintaining the general standard
    of training of NDT personnel for industrial needs. It also establishes the minimum
    requirements for effective structured training of NDT personnel to ensure eligibility
    for qualification examinations leading to third-party certification according
    to recognized standards. In addition to non-destructive testing in general, its
    guidelines for syllabuses cover acoustic emission, eddy current, leak, magnetic
    particle, penetrant, radiographic, ultrasonic and visual testing.
