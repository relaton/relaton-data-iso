abstract:
- content: "This document specifies a method for determining the scratch properties
    of plastics under defined conditions.\nThe method defined in this document is
    used to investigate the behaviour of specified types of specimens under the scratch
    conditions defined and for classifying the type of scratch of specimens within
    the limitations inherent in the test conditions. It can also be used to determine
    comparative data for different types of material by means of a so-called scratch
    map in which the types of scratch behaviour for each set of test conditions of
    test load and test speed are determined using the basic method of constant-load
    testing, and also by means of the so-called critical normal load determined using
    an alternative method of linearly increasing load testing.\nThe method is suitable
    for use with the following range of materials.\n—     thermoplastic moulding,
    extrusion and casting materials, including filled and reinforced compounds in
    addition to unfilled types;\n—     thermosetting moulding materials, including
    filled and reinforced compounds; \n—     thermosetting sheets, rigid thermoplastic
    moulding and extrusion materials, including filled and reinforced compounds in
    addition to unfilled types.\nThe method specifies the preferred dimensions for
    the test specimen and the preferred scratch-tip geometry."
