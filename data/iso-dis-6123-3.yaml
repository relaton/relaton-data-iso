abstract:
- content: Specifies classes of dimensional tolerances and test methods for the measurement
    of dimensions. Defines covered rollers as cylindrical cores, generally of metal,
    with a cover of rubber or plastics for particular use. They are manufactured in
    a wide variety of sizes and hardness grades depending on the intended use. - Part
    1 and 2 of this standard deal with the requirements for hardness, and the surface
    characteristics.
