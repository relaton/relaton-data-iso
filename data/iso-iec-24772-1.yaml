  content: "This document catalogues common software programming language vulnerabilities
    and their mitigations in the development of systems where assured behaviour is
    required for security, safety, mission-critical and business-critical software.
    In general, this guidance is applicable to the software developed, reviewed, or
    maintained for any application.\nThis document is Part 1 of a series. Vulnerabilities
    and their mitigations are described in this document in a generic manner that
    is applicable to a broad range of programming languages. \nThis document is supplemented
    by other Parts in this series that describe how vulnerabilities catalogued in
    this document arise and how they can be mitigated in specific programming languages,
    such as C, C++, Ada, Java, Python, SPARK, and Fortran."
