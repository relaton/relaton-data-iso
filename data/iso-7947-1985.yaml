- content: Specifies both geometrical and practical tests for these moulding machines
    for general purpose use and normal accuracy, gives the corresponding permissible
    deviations and furthermore the nomenclature appropriate to each part of the machine
    in English an French, and the equivalent terms in German, Spanish, Italian and
    Swedish. It deals only with verification of the accuracy of the machine. It does
    not apply to the testing of the running of the machine or to its characteristics
    which should generally be checked before the accuracy is tested.
