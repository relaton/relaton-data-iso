    ISO 20816-1:2016 establishes general conditions and procedures for the measurement and evaluation of vibration using measurements made on rotating, non-rotating and non-reciprocating parts of complete machines. It is applicable to measurements of both absolute and relative radial shaft vibration with regard to the monitoring of radial clearances, but excludes axial shaft vibration. The general evaluation criteria, which are presented in terms of both vibration magnitude and change of vibration, relate to both operational monitoring and acceptance testing. They have been provided primarily with regard to securing reliable, safe, long-term operation of the machine while minimizing adverse effects on associated equipment. Guidelines are also presented for setting operational limits.
    NOTE 1       The evaluation criteria for different classes of machinery will be included in other parts of ISO 20816 when they become available. In the meantime, guidelines are given in Clause 6.
    NOTE 2       The term "shaft vibration" is used throughout ISO 20816 because, in most cases, measurements are made on machine shafts. However, the ISO 20816 series is also applicable to measurements made on other rotating elements if such elements are found to be more suitable, provided that the guidelines are respected.
    For the purposes of ISO 20816, operational monitoring is considered to be those vibration measurements made during the normal operation of a machine. The ISO 20816 series permits the use of different measurement quantities and methods, provided that they are well-defined and their limitations are set out, so that the interpretation of the measurements is well-understood.
    The evaluation criteria relate only to the vibration produced by the machine itself and not the vibration transmitted to it from outside.
    ISO 20816-1:2016 does not include consideration of torsional vibration.
    NOTE 3       For torsional vibration, see, for example, ISO 3046‑5, ISO 22266‑1 or VDI 2039.
