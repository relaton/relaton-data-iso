abstract:
- content: "ISO 18245:2003 defines code values used to enable the classification of
    merchants into specific categories based on the type of business, trade or services
    supplied. Values are specified only for those merchant categories that are generally
    expected to originate retail financial transactions. \nISO 18245:2003 also establishes
    the procedures for a Registration and Maintenance Management Group (RMMG), which
    considers requests for new code values, and a Maintenance Agency (MA), which provides
    the administrative procedures required to maintain an up-to-date list of codes.\nIt
    is not within the scope of ISO 18245:2003 to mandate the use of merchant category
    codes in any given situation."
