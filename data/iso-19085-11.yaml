abstract:
- content: "This document specifies the safety requirements and measures for combined
    woodworking machines (defined in 3.1), capable of continuous production use, with
    manual loading and unloading of the workpiece and hereinafter referred to also
    as “machines”. \nThe machines are designed to cut solid wood and material with
    similar physical characteristics to wood.\nIt deals with all significant hazards,
    hazardous situations and events, listed in Annex A, relevant to the machines,
    when operated, adjusted and maintained as intended and under the conditions foreseen
    by the manufacturer; reasonably foreseeable misuse has been considered too. Transport,
    assembly, dismantling, disabling and scrapping phases have also been taken into
    account.\nThis document does apply to machines also equipped with the devices/additional
    working units listed in the Scopes of ISO 19085 5:202x, ISO 19085 6:202x, ISO
    19085-7:202x and ISO 19085-9:202x.\nThis document does not apply to:\na) machines
    incorporating only a planing unit and a mortising device;\nNOTE \tSuch machines
    are dealt with in ISO 19085-7:202x.\nb) combined machines incorporating a band
    saw unit;\nc) machines with a mortising unit with a separate drive other than
    the planing unit drive;\nd) machines intended for use in potentially explosive
    atmosphere;\ne) machines manufactured before the date of its publication as an
    International Standard."
