abstract:
- content: "1.1  Purpose  \nThis International Standard defines a method for automating
    the counting of Function Points that is generally consistent with the Function
    Point Counting Practices Manual, Release 4.3.1 (IFPUG CPM) produced by the International
    Function Point Users Group (IFPUG). Guidelines in this International Standard
    may differ from those in the IFPUG CPM at points where subjective judgments have
    to be replaced by the rules needed for automation. The IFPUG CPM was selected
    as the anchor for this International Standard because it is the most widely used
    functional measurement specification with a large supporting infrastructure maintained
    by a professional organization.\nThis International Standard is applicable to
    the functional sizing of transaction-oriented software applications, and in particular
    those with data persistency. To be consistent with the IFPUG CPM, the International
    Standard provides details on the support of applications using relational databases.
    However, the International Standard can be used and extended for any type of transactional
    application with data persistency.\nThis International Standard does not address
    the sizing of enhancements to an application or maintained functionality (often
    called Enhancement Function Points). Extensions of the automated counting methods
    described in this International Standard such as Automated Enhancement Function
    Points will be addressed in future addendums to this International Standard. This
    International Standard does not address sizing for the non-functional components
    of a software application. Non-functional components (as defined by IFPUG) include:\n—
    \         Structural Quality Constraints Reliability, Security, Performance Efficiency,
    Maintainability, etc.\n—          Organizational Constraints locations for operations,
    target hardware, compliance to standards, etc.\n—          Environmental Constraints
    interoperability, security, privacy, safety, etc.\n—          Implementation Constraints
    development language, delivery schedule, etc."
