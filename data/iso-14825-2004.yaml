    ISO 14825:2004 specifies the conceptual and logical data model and the exchange format for geographic data bases for Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) applications. It includes a specification of potential contents of such data bases (features, attributes and relationships), a specification of how these contents shall be represented, and of how relevant information about the database itself can be specified (metadata).
    The focus of this International Standard is on ITS applications and it emphasizes road and road-related information. ITS applications, however, also require information in addition to road and road-related information.
    EXAMPLE 1 ITS applications need information about addressing systems in order to specify locations and/or destinations. Consequently, information about the administrative and postal subdivisions of an area is essential.
    EXAMPLE 2 Map display is an important component of ITS applications. For proper map display, the inclusion of contextual information such as land and water cover is essential.
    EXAMPLE 3 Point-of-Interest (POI) or service information is a key feature of traveller information. It adds value to end-user ITS applications.
