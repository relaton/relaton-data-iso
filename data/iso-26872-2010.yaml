- content: |-
    ISO 26872:2010 specifies requirements for the following:
    -        planning for disposal of satellites operating at geosynchronous altitude to ensure that final disposal is sufficiently characterized and that adequate propellant will be reserved for the manoeuvre;
    -        selecting final disposal orbits where the satellite will not re-enter the operational region within the next 100 years;
    -        executing the disposal manoeuvre successfully;
    -        depleting all energy sources on board the vehicle before the end of its life to minimize the possibility of an event that can produce debris.
    ISO 26872:2010 provides techniques for planning and executing the disposal of space hardware that reflect current internationally accepted guidelines and consider current operational procedures and best practices.
