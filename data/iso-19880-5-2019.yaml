    This document specifies the requirements for wire or textile reinforced hoses and hose assemblies suitable for dispensing hydrogen up to 70 MPa nominal working pressure, in the operating temperature range of −40 °C to 65 °C.
    This document contains safety requirements for material, design, manufacture and testing of gaseous hydrogen hose and hose assemblies for hydrogen fuelling stations.
    Hoses and hose assemblies excluded from the scope of this document are the following:
    1)   those used as part of a vehicle high pressure on-board fuel storage system,
    2)   those used as part of a vehicle low pressure fuel delivery system, and
    3)   flexible metal hoses.
    NOTE 1  This document was developed primarily for hoses and hose assemblies for dispensing high pressure hydrogen from refuelling dispensers to hydrogen vehicles. Requirements for hoses used to deliver hydrogen from a transportable vessel (e.g. trailer) into a buffer storage of a station are addressed in ISO 16964.
    NOTE 2  Hose assemblies include the hose with connectors on each end (see Figure 1). Each connector has two basic functional elements that are addressed as described below:
    1)    Coupling to hose. This function is defined by requirements and verified (along with the hose itself) by performance-based tests in this document.
    2)    Fitting for transition and connection to the piping system or equipment. This function is addressed by reference to appropriate hydrogen equipment standards and piping codes.
