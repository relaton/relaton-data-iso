    ISO/TS 21219-9:2016 establishes the method of delivering service and network information within a TPEG service. The TPEG-SNI application is designed to allow the efficient and language independent delivery of information about the availability of the same service on another bearer channel or similar service data from another service provider, directly from service provider to end-users.
    NOTE          A number of tables of information are described, which provide comprehensive options for describing services, their timing, content, geographical coverage, etc. In all TPEG streams, it is mandatory to deliver to so-called GST. Additionally, it is possible to signal linkage of content between different bearers and services.
