  content: "ISO/PAS 28000:2005 specifies the requirements for a security management
    system, including those aspects critical to security assurance of the supply chain.
    These aspects include, but are not limited to, financing, manufacturing, information
    management and the facilities for packing, storing and transferring goods between
    modes of transport and locations. Security management is linked to many other
    aspects of business management. These other aspects should be considered directly,
    where and when they have an impact on security management, including transporting
    these goods along the supply chain.\nISO/PAS 28000:2005 is applicable to all sizes
    of organizations, from small to multinational, in manufacturing, service, storage
    or transportation at any stage of the production or supply chain that wishes to:
    \nThere are legislative and regulatory codes that address some of the requirements
    in ISO/PAS 28000:2005. It is not the intention of ISO/PAS 28000:2005 to require
    duplicative demonstration of compliance.\nOrganizations that choose third party
    certification can further demonstrate that they are contributing significantly
    to supply chain security."
