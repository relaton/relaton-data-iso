    ISO 18901:2010 establishes the specifications for photographic films intended for the storage of records.
    ISO 18901:2010 is applicable specifically to films with a base of safety cellulose ester or polyester having silver-gelatin emulsions, processed to produce a black-and-white silver image by negative or full-reversal processing. It applies to film processed using a monobath that includes thiosulfate as the fixing agent, followed by a conventional wash. It also is applicable to silver films given a stabilizing treatment by partial or full conversion to silver sulfide, silver selenide or gold.
    ISO 18901:2010 is applicable to films having ultrasonic or dielectric (induction-heated) splices. It does not cover films with splices made of adhesive tape or solvent-type spIices.
    ISO 18901:2010 is not applicable to films with chromogenic black-and-white images, colour images of any type, or to films with a magnetic recording track. It does not apply to films with silver images produced by dry or thermal processing or by diffusion-reversal processing, or to films that have been processed by a monobath using means other than a thiosulfate-type fixing solution. It is not applicable to films where the silver salts are removed by means other than thiosulfate solutions.
    ISO 18901:2010 is not applicable to films to which lacquers have been applied.
