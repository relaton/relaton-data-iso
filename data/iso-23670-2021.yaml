    This document provides guidance and requirements for test providers and interested parties to implement vibration testing.
    This document specifies methods, including the force limiting approach, to mitigate unnecessary over-testing of spacecraft, subsystems and units for space application.
    The technical requirements in this document can be tailored to meet the actual test objectives.
