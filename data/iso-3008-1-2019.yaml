    This document, used in conjunction with ISO 834-1, specifies a method for determining the fire resistance of door and shutter assemblies designed primarily for installation within openings incorporated in vertical separating elements, such as
    —          hinged and pivoted doors,
    —          horizontally sliding and vertically sliding doors, including articulated sliding doors and sectional doors,
    —          steel single-skin folding shutters (un-insulated),
    —          other sliding, folding doors,
    —          tilting doors,
    —          rolling shutter doors,
    —          removable panels in walls,
    —          self-closing openable windows.
    Requirements are included for mechanical pre-conditioning, e.g. "cycling" of door and shutter assemblies prior to the conduct of the fire-resistance test.
