    This document specifies general requirements and guidance for metagenomics-dedicated sample preparation, generating and analyzing metagenomics sequence data obtained from massive parallel sequencing platforms. The specified metagenomics process includes the following stages:
    a) Sampling strategy and process, including type, storage, transportation, extraction, quality;
    b) Nucleic acid library preparation
    c) Sequencing strategy and assessment;
    d) Database construction;
    e) Bioinformatics analysis and report
    f) Validation and evaluation for bioinformatics pipeline, and database.
    This document applies to laboratories and research organizations.
