    This International Standard establishes the specifications for photographic films intended for the storage of records.
    It is applicable specifically to films with a base of safety cellulose ester or polyester having silver-gelatin emulsions, processed to produce a black-and-white silver image by negative or full-reversal processing. It applies to film processed by a monobath, which includes thiosulfate as the fixing agent, followed by a conventional wash. It also is applicable to silver films given a stabilizing treatment by partial or full conversion to silver sulfide, silver selenide or gold.
    This International Standard is applicable to films having ultrasonic or dielectric (induction heated) splices. It does not cover films with splices made by means of adhesive tape or solvent-type spIices.
    NOTE Solvent-type splices are suspect since they may retain traces of residual solvents containing peroxide which can pose some risk of oxidative attach on the silver image.
    This International Standard is not applicable to films with chromogenic black-and-white images, colour images of any type, nor to films with a magnetic recording track. It does not apply to films with silver images produced by dry or thermal processing or by diffusion-reversal processing, nor to films that have been processed by a monobath using a means other than a thiosulfate-type fixing solution. It is not applicable to films where the silver salts are removed by means other than thiosulfate solutions.
    This International Standard is not applicable to films to which lacquers have been applied.
