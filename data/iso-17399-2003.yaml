    ISO 17399:2003 defines all generic requirements for manned space flight vehicle/habitat structures and flight crew training or simulation facilities and the related equipment that directly interfaces with manned space system flight crew members. ISO 17399:2003 covers the field of human factors as they relate to the space environment and space habitats. These man-systems integration requirements apply to space system launch, re-entry, on-orbit and extraterrestrial environments.
    The requirements specified in ISO 17399:2003 are applicable to any manned space flight programme.
