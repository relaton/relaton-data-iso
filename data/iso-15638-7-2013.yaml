abstract:
- content: "ISO 15638-7:2013 provides business framework based on a (multiple) service
    provider oriented approach for the provision of additional unregulated services
    to regulated commercial freight vehicles using a common on-board telematics platform,
    including:\na) definition of the service that a 'Service Provider' has to provide,
    including a given service level (the service definition comprises service elements
    such as 'retrieve data from IVS', 'map data to a map with access conditions',
    etc.); \nb) means to realise the service;\nc) application data, naming content
    and quality that an IVS has to deliver;\nd) development of (any) rules for the
    approval and auditing of service providers for non-regulated service provision.\nISO
    15638-7:2013 defines the requirements for the scope and framework for all TARV
    commercial (unregulated) applications. These applications may then be simply instantiated
    as commercial applications conforming to the requirements of ISO 15638-7:2013,
    in which case no further standardization is required, so long as conformance can
    be demonstrated, and service offerings may vary from service provider to service
    provider. Where it is decided that there is benefit in standardized instantiation
    to a common format for a particular service, a separate standards deliverable
    will be required, but may be developed by the consensus of experts in that area
    of application by reference to ISO 15638-7:2013 in respect of the TARV technical
    aspects.\nISO 15638 has been developed for use in the context of regulated commercial
    freight vehicles (hereinafter referred to as 'regulated vehicles'). There is nothing,
    however, to prevent a jurisdiction extending or adapting the scope to include
    other types of regulated vehicles, as it deems appropriate."
