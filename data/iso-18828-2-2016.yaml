    ISO 18828-2:2016 describes a reference planning process for seamless production planning.
    The scope of the discussed reference process focusses on the planning of production systems such as make-to-stock or assemble-to-order production. The analysis of the process activities has been limited to those within the production planning. The following aspects are within the scope of ISO 18828-2:2016:
    ·         general overview of the reference planning process;
    ·         basic principles of the process model;
    ·         description of each level identified within the reference planning process for production planning;
    ·         structure of activities and relations within each planning discipline;
    ·         dependencies of interdisciplinary activities.
    The following items are outside the scope of ISO 18828-2:2016:
    ·         material requirement planning/manufacturing resource planning;
    ·         production order control;
    ·         production process;
    ·         early stage product design;
    ·         order management, inventory management, purchasing, transportation, warehousing;
    ·         production facilities planning/manufacturing facilities planning (physical plant and equipment), including any kind of resource that is not directly related to the manufacturing process;
    ·         value chain (inbound logistics, operations management, outbound logistics, marketing and sales);
    ·         resource visualization;
    ·         process simulation.
