    This part 1 of ISO 18623 is applicable to compressors and compressor units having an operating pressure greater than 0,5 bar and designed to compress air, nitrogen or inert gases. This standard deals with all significant hazards, hazardous situations and events relevant to the design, installation, operation, maintenance, dismantling and disposal of compressors and compressor units, when they are used as intended and under conditions of misuse which are reasonably foreseeable by the manufacturer (see Clause 4).
    This part of ISO 18623 includes under the general term compressor units those machines which comprise:
    - the compressor;
    - a drive system;
    - any component or device which is necessary for operation.
    This part covers compressors driven by any power media, including battery powered and which are fitted in or used with motor vehicles.
    The significant hazards dealt with in the standard are identified in Annex A.
    It does not cover requirements for compressors and compressor units used in potentially explosive atmospheres.
    It is not applicable to compressors and compressor units which are manufactured before the date of publication of this standard.
    It does not cover compressors and compressor units for processing petroleum, petrochemicals, or chemicals within the scope of ISO/TC 67.
