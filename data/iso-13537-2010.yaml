  content: ISO 13537:2010 presents a reference architecture for space data systems
    (RASDS). The RASDS is intended to provide a standardized approach for description
    of data system architectures and high-level designs, which individual CCSDS working
    groups may use within CCSDS. This approach is aligned with current practices in
    the fields of system and software architecture and is specifically adapted for
    the space domain. While it is intended for use within CCSDS, it is also suitable
    for use by mission and project design teams to describe system architectures and
    designs within the space domain. It does not propose any specific formal modeling
    method or tool, but can be adapted to use methods like UML or SysML.
