    This document specifies a method for determining the boiling range of liquids that boil between 30 °C and 300 °C at normal pressure, and that are chemically stable and do not corrode the apparatus during the distillation.
    The method is applicable to organic liquids such as hydrocarbons, esters, alcohols, ketones, ethers and similar products.
    NOTE 1        The method differs from that described in ISO 918 with respect to the volume of the distillation flask, the type of cooler and the distillation receiver.
    NOTE 2        The method differs from that specified in ISO 3405 with respect to the volume of the distillation flask and the diameter of the hole in the flask support.
