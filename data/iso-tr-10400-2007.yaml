    ISO/TR 10400:2007 illustrates the equations and templates necessary to calculate the various pipe properties given in International Standards, including pipe performance properties, such as axial strength, internal pressure resistance and collapse resistance, minimum physical properties, product assembly force (torque), product test pressures, critical product dimensions related to testing criteria, critical dimensions of testing equipment, and critical dimensions of test samples.
    For equations related to performance properties, extensive background information is also provided regarding their development and use.
    Equations presented in ISO/TR 10400:2007 are intended for use with pipe manufactured in accordance with ISO 11960 or API 5CT, ISO 11961 or API 5D, and ISO 3183 or API 5L, as applicable. These equations and templates may be extended to other pipe with due caution. Pipe cold-worked during production is included in the scope of this Technical Report (e.g. cold rotary straightened pipe). Pipe modified by cold working after production, such as expandable tubulars and coiled tubing, is beyond the scope of this Technical Report.
    Application of performance property equations in ISO/TR 10400:2007 to line pipe and other pipe is restricted to their use as casing/tubing in a well or laboratory test, and requires due caution to match the heat-treat process, straightening process, yield strength, etc., with the closest appropriate casing/tubing product. Similar caution should be exercised when using the performance equations for drill pipe.
    ISO/TR 10400:2007 and the equations contained herein relate the input pipe manufacturing parameters in ISO 11960 or API 5CT, ISO 11961 or API 5, and ISO 3183 or API 5L to expected pipe performance. The design equations in ISO/TR 10400:2007 are not to be understood as a manufacturing warrantee. Manufacturers are typically licensed to produce tubular products in accordance with manufacturing specifications which control the dimensions and physical properties of their product. Design equations, on the other hand, are a reference point for users to characterize tubular performance and begin their own well design or research of pipe input properties.
    ISO/TR 10400:2007 is not a design code. It only provides equations and templates for calculating the properties of tubulars intended for use in downhole applications. ISO/TR 10400:2007 does not provide any guidance about loads that may be encountered by tubulars or about safety margins needed for acceptable design. Users are responsible for defining appropriate design loads and selecting adequate safety factors to develop safe and efficient designs. The design loads and safety factors will likely be selected based on historical practice, local regulatory requirements, and specific well conditions.
    All equations and listed values for performance properties in ISO/TR 10400:2007 assume a benign environment and material properties conforming to ISO 11960 or API 5CT,   ISO 11961 or API 5D, and ISO 3183 or API 5L. Other environments may require additional analyses, such as that outlined in Annex D.
    Pipe performance properties under dynamic loads and pipe connection sealing resistance are excluded from the scope of ISO/TR 10400:2007.
