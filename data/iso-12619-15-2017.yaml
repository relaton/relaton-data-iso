    ISO 12619-15:2017 specifies tests and requirements for the filter, a compressed gaseous hydrogen (CGH2) and hydrogen/natural gas blend fuel system component intended for use on the types of motor vehicles defined in ISO 3833.
    It is applicable to vehicles using CGH2 in accordance with ISO 14687-1 or ISO 14687-2 and hydrogen/natural gas blend using natural gas in accordance with ISO 15403-1 and ISO/TR 15403-2. It is not applicable to the following:
    a)    liquefied hydrogen (LH2) fuel system components;
    b)    fuel containers;
    c)    stationary gas engines;
    d)    container mounting hardware;
    e)    electronic fuel management;
    f)     refuelling receptacles;
    g)    fuel cell vehicles.
    NOTE 1    It is recognized that miscellaneous components not specifically covered herein can be examined to meet the criteria of ISO 12619-15:2017 and tested according to the appropriate functional tests.
    NOTE 2    All references to pressure in ISO 12619-15:2017  are considered gauge pressures unless otherwise specified.
