    ISO 4513:2010 establishes the location of drivers' eyes inside a vehicle. Elliptical (eyellipse) models in three dimensions are used to represent tangent cut-off percentiles of driver eye locations. Procedures are provided to construct 95th and 99th percentile tangent cut-off eyellipses for a 50/50 gender mix, adult user population.
    Neck pivot, P, points are defined to establish specific left and right eye points for direct and indirect viewing tasks described in SAE J1050. These P points are defined only for adjustable seat eyellipses.
    ISO 4513:2010 applies to Class A vehicles (passenger cars, multipurpose passenger vehicles and light trucks) as defined in SAE J1100. It also applies to Class B vehicles (heavy trucks).
