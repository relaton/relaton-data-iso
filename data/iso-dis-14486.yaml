    This International Standard specifies the characteristics of laminate floor coverings, supplied in either tile or plank form. To encourage the consumer to make an informed choice, the standard includes a classification system (see ISO 10874) based on intensity of use, which shows where these floor coverings should give satisfactory service. It also specifies requirements for marking and packaging.
    Laminate floor coverings are generally designed for floating installations for interior use and are considered for domestic and commercial levels of use, including domestic kitchens. This document does not specify requirements relating to the use in areas which are subjected to frequent wetting, such as bathrooms, laundry rooms or saunas. In general laminate floor coverings can only be used in those areas when authorized by the manufacturer and under conditions described in the manufacturer's installation guidelines.
