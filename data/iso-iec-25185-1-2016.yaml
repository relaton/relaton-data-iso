- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: |-
    ISO/IEC 25185-1:2016 provides an authentication protocol suitable for use in physical and logical access control systems based on ICCs and related systems which support standards based AES-128 and RSA-2048 ciphers and the SHA-256 hashing algorithm.
    It specifies PLAID and its implementation in sufficient detail to allow any two or more implementations to be interoperable.
    It does not address how implementations share cryptographic keys, access control system credential records (including revocation) or manage payload entities such as PIN, PINHash, or biometric templates or other payload objects.
