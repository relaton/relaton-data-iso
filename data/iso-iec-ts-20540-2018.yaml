  content: "This document provides recommendations and checklists which can be used
    to support the specification and operational testing of cryptographic modules
    in their operational environment within an organization's security system. \nThe
    cryptographic modules have four security levels which ISO/IEC 19790 defines to
    provide for a wide spectrum of data sensitivity (e.g. low-value administrative
    data, million-dollar funds transfers, life-protecting data, personal identity
    information, and sensitive information used by government) and a diversity of
    application environments (e.g. a guarded facility, an office, removable media,
    and a completely unprotected location).\nThis document includes:\na)    recommendations
    to perform secure assessing for cryptographic module installation, configuration
    and operation;\nb)    recommendations to inspecting the key management system,
    protection of authentication credentials, and public and critical security parameters
    in the operational environment;\nc)    recommendations for identifying cryptographic
    module vulnerabilities;\nd)    checklists for the cryptographic algorithm policy,
    security guidance and regulation, security manage requirements, security level
    for each of the 11 requirement areas, the strength of the security function, etc.;
    and\ne)    recommendations to determine that the cryptographic module's deployment
    satisfies the security requirements of the organization.\nThis document assumes
    that the cryptographic module has been validated as conformant with ISO/IEC 19790.\nIt
    can be used by an operational tester along with other recommendations if needed.\nThis
    document is limited to the security related to the cryptographic module. It does
    not include assessing the security of the operational or application environment.
    It does not define techniques for the identification, assessment and acceptance
    of the organization's operational risk. \nThe organization's accreditation, deployment
    and operation processes, shown in Figure 1, is not included to the scope of this
    document.\nThis document addresses operational testers who perform the operational
    testing for the cryptographic modules in their operational environment authorizing
    officials of cryptographic modules."
