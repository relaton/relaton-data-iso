    This document specifies test methods for assessing important properties of mechanically recycled polypropylene [PP (REC)] and polyethylene [PE (REC)] in granular or pellet form for use in conventional plastics processing techniques.
    General guidance is provided for determining the characteristics of PP (REC) and PE (REC), which can be used at 100 % or in a proportion with standard (virgin) material grades available for processing on machines such as injection moulding, blow moulding, types of extrusion techniques, etc.
    This document intends to help plastics processors and end users who intend to use recyclates with agreement on product specifications, as applicable.
    Country specific health and food-safety and environment related regulations for use of plastics recyclates are not in the scope of this document.
    Mixture of recyclates of PP and PE is not in the scope of this document.
