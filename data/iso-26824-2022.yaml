  content: This document defines terms that are relevant to the characterization of
    particles and particulate systems. This document includes such fields as the representation
    of results of particle size analysis, the descriptive and quantitative representation
    of particle shape and morphology, sample preparation, specific surface area and
    porosity characterization and such measurement methods as sedimentation, classification,
    acoustic methods, laser diffraction, dynamic light scattering, single particle
    light interaction methods, differential electrical mobility analysis, image analysis
    and others in a size scale from nanometre to millimetre.
