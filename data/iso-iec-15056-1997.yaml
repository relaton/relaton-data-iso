abstract:
- content: This International Standard specifies the signaling protocol for the support
    of the Transit Counter additional network feature (ANF-TC) at the Q reference
    point between Private Integrated Services Network Exchanges (PINXs) connected
    together within a Private Integrated Services Network (PISN). ANF-TC is a feature
    that limits the number of Transit PINXs that a call setup request may be routed
    through e.g., to protect the network against indefinite looping. The Q reference
    point is defined in ISO/IEC 11579- 1. Service specifications are produced in three
    stages and according to the method specified in CCITT Recommendation I. 130. This
    International Standard contains the stage 3 specification for the Q reference
    point and satisfies the requirements identified by the stage 1 and stage 2 specifications
    in ISO/IEC 15055. The signaling protocol for ANF-TC operates in association with
    the signaling protocols for basic circuit switched call control (as specified
    in ISO/IEC 11572) and call independent (connection oriented) signaling connections
    (as specified in ISOIIEC 11582). This International Standard also specifies additional
    signaling protocol requirements for the support of interactions at the Q reference
    point between ANF-TC and other supplementary services and ANFs. This International
    Standard is applicable to PINXs that can interconnect to form a PISN.
