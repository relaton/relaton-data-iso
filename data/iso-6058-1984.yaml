  content: Describes a procedure for ground waters, surface waters and drinking waters.
    It can also be used for municipal and industrial raw waters, provided they do
    not contain interfering amounts of heavy metals. The procedure is not applicable
    to sea waters and other similar waters having a high concentration of salts. It
    is applicable to waters with contents ranging from 2 to 100 mg/l. For higher contents
    a diluted sample is to be used.
