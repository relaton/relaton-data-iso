  content: Applies to steel sheet of structural quality in the grades HR235, HR275
    and HR355, usually without the use of microalloying elements, produced in thicknesses
    from 1,6 mm to 6 mm and widths of 600 mm and over. Specifies conditions of manufacture
    (steelmaking, chemical composition, chemical analysis, weldability, application,
    mechanical properties, surface condition), dimensional tolerances, sampling, mechanical
    property tests (tensile test, bend test), retests, resubmission, workmanship,
    inspection and acceptance, coil size, marking, information to be supplied by the
    purchaser.
