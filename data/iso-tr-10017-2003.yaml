  content: "ISO/TR 10017:2003 provides guidance on the selection of appropriate statistical
    techniques that may be useful to an organization in developing, implementing,
    maintaining and improving a quality management system in compliance with ISO 9001.
    This is done by examining those requirements of ISO 9001 that involve the use
    of quantitative data, and then identifying and describing the statistical techniques
    that can be useful when applied to such data.\nThe list of statistical techniques
    cited in ISO/TR 10017:2003 is neither complete nor exhaustive, and does not preclude
    the use of any other techniques (statistical or otherwise) that are deemed to
    be beneficial to the organization. Furthermore, ISO/TR 10017:2003 does not attempt
    to prescribe which statistical technique(s) are to be used; nor does it attempt
    to advise on how the technique(s) are to be implemented. \nISO/TR 10017:2003 is
    not intended for contractual, regulatory or certification/registration purposes.
    It is not intended to be used as a mandatory checklist for compliance with ISO
    9001:2000 requirements. The justification for using statistical techniques is
    that their application would help to improve the effectiveness of the quality
    management system."
