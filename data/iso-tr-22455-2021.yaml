    This document describes a method for high throughput evaluation of cytotoxic response of 3D model cells exposed to NPs without optical interference.
    The method in this document is intended to be used in biological testing laboratories that are competent in the culture and growth of cells and the evaluation of cytotoxicity of NPs using 3D-model cells.
    This method applies to materials that consist of nano-objects such as nanoparticles, nanopowders, nanofibres, nanotubes, and nanowires, as well as aggregates and agglomerates of these materials.
