    This International Standard specifies the physical and magnetic characteristics of an 8 mm wide magnetic tape cartridge to
    enable physical interchange of such cartridges between drives. It also specifies the quality of the recorded signals, the recording
    method and the recorded format called VXA-1, and thereby allowing data interchange between drives by means of such
    magnetic tape cartridges.
    This International Standard specifies three types depending on the length of magnetic tape contained in the case, referred to as
    Type A, Type B and Type C.
    Information interchange between systems also requires, at a minimum, agreement between the interchange parties upon the
    interchange code(s) and the specifications of the structure and labelling of the information on the interchanged cartridge.
    If compression is used with this format, it shall be according to International Standard ISO/IEC 15200.
