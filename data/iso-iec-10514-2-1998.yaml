    1.1 General
    This part of ISO/IEC 10514 specifies extensions to allow generic programming facilities to be added to the base Modula-2
    language defined in International Standard ISO/IEC 10514-1 without altering the meaning of valid programs allowed by the
    Base Language (except for the use of the new keyword introduced by this standard—see clause 5).
    1.2 Specifications included in this part of ISO/IEC 10514
    In addition to the specifications included in the Base Language this part of ISO/IEC 10514 provides specifications for:
    — required symbols for programs written in ISO Standard Modula-2 with Generic extensions;
    — the lexical structure and semantics of programs written in ISO Standard Modula-2 with Generic extensions;
    — the syntax of programs written in ISO Standard Modula-2 with Generic extensions;
    — violations of the rules for the use of the Generic extensions that a conforming implementation is required to detect;
    — further compliance requirements for implementations, including documentation requirements.
    1.3 Relationship to ISO/IEC 10514-1
    This part of ISO/IEC 10514 is part two of the multi-part Standard ISO/IEC 10514. This part of ISO/IEC 10514 extends and
    modifies the Base Language ISO/IEC 10514-1, but the adoption of this part of ISO/IEC 10514 is optional with respect to the
    Base Language. This part of ISO/IEC 10514 is also independent of any other parts of ISO/IEC 10514, except for part 1, and
    can be adopted either together with or independently of such other parts.
    1.4 Specifications not within the scope of this part of ISO/IEC 10514
    In addition to the categories of specifications excluded by the Base Language this part of ISO/IEC 10514 provides no
    specifications for:
    — the method by which specific refinements are constructed from generic library modules;
    — the method by which generic library modules, their associated refining modules, and the refinements produced by these are
    stored (including any correspondence between the module names and system file names where files are used).
