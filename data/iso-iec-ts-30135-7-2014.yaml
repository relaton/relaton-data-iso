abstract:
- content: |-
    EPUB® documents, unlike print books or PDF files, are designed to change. The content flows, or reflows, to fit
    the screen and to fit the needs of the reader. The EPUB 3.0 Specification says that "content presentation should
    adapt to the user rather than the user having to adapt to a particular representation of content."
    But this principle doesn't work for all types of documents. Sometimes content and design are so intertwined
    they cannot be separated. Any change in appearance risks changing the meaning, or losing all meaning. Fixedlayout
    documents give content creators greater control over presentation, when a reflowable EPUB is not
    suitable for the content.
    This document, EPUB 3 Fixed-Layout Documents, defines a set of metadata properties to allow declarative
    expression of intended rendering behaviors of fixed-layout documents in the context of EPUB 3. It also defines
    mechanisms to express the intended rendering dimensions of fixed-layout XHTML and SVG [ContentDocs30]
    content, as well as bitmap images.
