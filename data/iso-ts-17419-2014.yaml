abstract:
- content: 'ISO/TS 17419:2014 illustrates and specifies "Global Classification and
    Management of ITS Applications" (GCMA). It is based on the ITS station and communication
    architecture described in ISO 21217. It describes and specifies globally unique
    addresses and identifiers (ITS-S object identifiers) which are both internal and
    external to ITS stations and are used for ITS station management, describes how
    ITS-S object identifiers and related technical parameters are used for classification,
    registration and management of ITS applications and ITS application classes and
    how ITS-S object identifiers are used in the ITS communication protocol stack,
    introduces an organizational framework for registration and management of ITS-S
    objects, and defines and specifies management procedures at a high functional
    level. '
