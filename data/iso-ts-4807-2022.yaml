    This document is intended to support users of reference materials (RMs) for particle size analysis to identify suitable RMs (certified or not) for their needs. In line with the focus on users, questions on sample preparation that go beyond preparation of the sample as received by the user will not be covered by this document.
    This document describes the fundamental requirements that RMs (certified or not) for the determination of particle size shall fulfil in order to be fit for a given purpose. The document is limited to a description of the fundamental principles – the discussion whether a certain numerical value is fit for purpose is beyond the scope of this document.
    The scope of this document is limited to RMs (certified or not) in the form of particles. This document does not deal with any other form of RMs, like calibration grids.
