abstract:
- content: This document specifies a method for determining the cross tensional strength
    of the bonded plates of carbon fibre reinforced plastics (CFRPs) to metal assemblies,
    with a standard specimen loaded in cross tension and under specified conditions
    of preparation, conditioning and testing. This method is intended for testing
    those bonded plates used in bonding carbon fibre reinforced plastics (CFRPs) to
    metal assemblies.
