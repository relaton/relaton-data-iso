abstract:
- content: |-
    This document gives guidance on the risk-based approach to follow for the design and operation of the LNG bunker transfer system, including the interface between the LNG bunkering supply facilities and receiving LNG fuelled vessels.
    This document provides requirements and recommendations for the development of a bunkering site and facility and the LNG bunker transfer system, providing the minimum functional requirements qualified by a structured risk assessment approach taking into consideration LNG properties and behaviour, simultaneous operations and all parties involved in the operation.
    This document is applicable to bunkering of both seagoing and inland trading vessels. It covers LNG bunkering from shore or ship, mobile to ship and ship to ship LNG supply scenarios, as described in Clause 4.
