abstract:
- content: "This document specifies a method for measuring the non-functional size
    of the software. It complements ISO/ IEC 20926:2009, which defines a method for
    measuring the functional size of the software. Together, the two standards provide
    a method to measure the software size derived by quantifying the functional and
    non-functional user requirements.\nMeasuring the non-functional size of the software
    assists organizations in multiple ways. It provides insight into the delivery
    of projects and maintenance of applications to assist in estimating effort and
    analyzing quality and productivity. Used in conjunction with FSM (Functional Size
    Measurement), the non-functional size provides information to identify items impacting
    quality and productivity -  positively or negatively.\nThe standard provides a
    clear and detailed description of the sizing method:\n- A foundation to ensure
    that sizing is consistent.\n- The sizing process.\n- Formulas to calculate the
    software size\n- Guidance to handle requirements involving both functional and
    non-functional aspects.\nThe standard also provides information on how to apply
    the non-functional size for project resource forecasting, cost estimation, and
    project performance management. "
