  content: "ISO 13506-2:2017 provides technical details for calculating predicted
    burn injury to human skin when its surface is subject to a varying heat flux,
    such as may occur due to energy transmitted through and by a garment or protective
    clothing ensemble exposed to flames. A series of test cases are provided against
    which the burn injury prediction calculation method is verified. It also contains
    requirements for the in situ calibration of the thermal energy sensor ? skin injury
    prediction system for the range of heat fluxes that occur under garments. \nThe
    skin burn injury calculation methods as presented in this test method do not include
    terms for handling short wavelength radiation that may penetrate the skin. The
    latter include arc flashes, some types of fire exposures with liquid or solid
    fuels, and nuclear sources."
