    This document describes the reference software and conformance suite for the file format documents in MPEG-4 and MPEG-H. Since these documents share a lot of technology, their reference software and conformance program are being handled together. These documents are: ISO/IEC 14496-12, ISO/IEC 14496-14, ISO/IEC 14496-15, ISO/IEC 14496-30 and ISO/IEC 23008-12.
    The purpose of the conformance suite is to cover the set of valid features that can be exercised in the file format. Media conformance is not covered, though of course in order to exercise the file format features, media will be stored.
