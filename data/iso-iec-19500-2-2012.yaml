abstract:
- content: |-
    ISO/IEC 19500-2:2012 specifies a comprehensive, flexible approach to supporting networks of objects that are distributed across and managed by multiple, heterogeneous CORBA-compliant Object Request Brokers (ORBs). The approach to inter-ORB operation is universal, because elements can be combined in many ways to satisfy a very broad range of needs.
    ISO/IEC 19500-2:2012 specifies
    - ORB interoperability architecture
    - Inter-ORB bridge support
    - General Inter-ORB Protocol (GIOP) for object request broker (ORB) interoperability. GIOP can be mapped onto any connection-oriented transport protocol that meets a minimal set of assumptions defined by this International Standard
    - Internet Inter-ORB Protocol (IIOP), a specific mapping of the GIOP which runs directly over connections that use the Internet Protocol and the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP/IP connections)
    - CORBA Security Attribute Service (SAS) protocol and its use within the CSIv2 architecture to address the requirements of CORBA security for interoperable authentication, delegation, and privileges
    ISO/IEC 19500-2:2012 provides a widely implemented and used particularization of ITU-T Rec. X.931 | ISO/IEC 14752. It supports interoperability and location transparency in ODP systems.
