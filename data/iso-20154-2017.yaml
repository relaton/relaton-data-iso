abstract:
- content: The purpose of ISO 20154:2017 is to provide general guidelines on the design
    of ship vibration isolation based on the basic methodology of vibration isolation
    for shipboard machinery, for example, auxiliary engine, compressor, fan, pump,
    etc. A well-designed vibration isolation system can significantly reduce the vibration
    transmission from shipboard machinery to ship structures lowering the noise level
    onboard the ship or the underwater noise radiated from the ship.
