    This document specifies a method for testing engines designed for automotive vehicles. It applies to the evaluation of their performance with a view, in particular to presenting curves of power and specific fuel consumption at full load as a function of engine speed.
    It applies only to net power assessment.
    This document concerns internal combustion engines used for propulsion of passenger cars, trucks and other motor vehicles, excluding motorcycles, mopeds and agricultural tractors normally travelling on roads, and included in one of the following categories:
    —     reciprocating internal combustion engines (spark-ignition or compression-ignition) but excluding free piston engines;
    —     rotary piston engines.
    These engines can be naturally aspirated or pressure-charged, either using a mechanical supercharger or turbocharger.
