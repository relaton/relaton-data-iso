    This document specifies a method for determining the electrostatic charging propensity of fibre ropes by measuring the surface potential generated by tribocharging.
    This document is not intended to be used to evaluate the safety of ropes for use in explosive atmospheres as safety also depends on application conditions.
    The test method described in this document is only applicable to fibre ropes of diameter between 12 mm and 20 mm.
    The result obtained using this test method is valid only for the charging mechanism and parameters described in the test method. Charging can be different in end-use applications.
