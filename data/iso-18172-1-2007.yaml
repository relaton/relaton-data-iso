  content: "ISO 18172-1:2007 specifies minimum requirements concerning material, design,
    construction and workmanship, manufacturing processes and testing of refillable
    transportable welded stainless steel gas cylinders, of water capacities from 0,5
    l up to and including 500 l, for compressed, liquefied and dissolved gases. ISO
    18172-1:2007 is applicable only to cylinders manufactured from stainless steels
    with test pressures up to 6 MPa (60 bar). \nIf required, transportable large cylinders
    of water capacity above 150 l and up to 500 l may be manufactured and certified
    to ISO 18172-1:2007, providing that handling facilities are provided."
