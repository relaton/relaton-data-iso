abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 17963:2013 describes a Web services protocol based on SOAP for
    use in management‑specific domains. These domains include the management of entities
    such as PCs, servers, devices, Web services and other applications manageable
    entities. Services can expose only a WS-Management interface or compose the WS-Management
    service interface with some of the many other Web service specifications. \nA
    crucial application for these services is in the area of systems management. To
    promote interoperability between management applications and managed resources,
    ISO/IEC PAS 17963:2012 identifies a core set of Web service specifications and
    usage requirements that expose a common set of operations central to all systems
    management. This includes the ability to do the following:\na) get, put (update),
    create, and delete individual resource instances, such as settings and dynamic
    values;\nb) enumerate the contents of containers and collections, such as large
    tables and logs;\nc) subscribe to events emitted by managed resources;\nd) execute
    specific management methods with strongly typed input and output parameters.\nIn
    each of these areas of scope, ISO/IEC 17963:2013 defines minimal implementation
    requirements for conformant Web service implementations. An implementation is
    free to extend beyond this set of operations, and to choose not to support one
    or more of the preceding areas of functionality if that functionality is not appropriate
    to the target device or system. \nISO/IEC 17963:2013 intends to meet the following
    requirements: \na) constrain Web services protocols and formats so that Web services
    can be implemented with a small footprint in both hardware and software management
    services;\nb) define minimum requirements for compliance without constraining
    richer implementations;\nc) ensure backward compatibility and interoperability
    with WS-Management version 1.0;\nd) ensure composability with other Web services
    specifications."
