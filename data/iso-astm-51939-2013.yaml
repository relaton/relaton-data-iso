abstract:
- content: 'ISO/ASTM 51939:2013 outlines irradiator installation qualification, operational
    qualification, performance qualification and routine product processing dosimetric
    procedures to be followed in the irradiation of blood and blood components by
    the blood-banking community. If followed, these procedures will help to ensure
    that the products processed with ionizing radiation from gamma, X-radiation (bremsstrahlung),
    or electron sources receive absorbed doses within a predetermined range. ISO/ASTM
    51939:2013 covers dosimetry for the irradiation of blood for these types of irradiators:
    self-contained irradiators (free-standing irradiators) utilizing 137Cs, 60Co or
    X-radiation (bremsstrahlung), teletherapy units, and electron accelerators. ISO/ASTM
    51939:2013 also covers the use of radiation-sensitive indicators for the visual
    and qualitative indication that the product has been irradiated.'
