    This document:
    —     specifies a group of structured and inter-related concepts pertaining to traceability as a legal or regulatory requirement in the Open-edi context, in addition to concepts that appear in other parts of ISO/IEC 15944 series these concepts having the characteristics of cultural adaptability through the use of multilingual terms and definitions;
    —     provides additional specifications for Open-edi scenarios and scenario components from the perspective of traceability as required by internal or external constraints in business transactions;
    —     provides a more detailed specification for business transactions regarding aspects of traceability, including refined models of Person, Data and Process in support of the ability for Open-edi to incorporate elements or characteristics of traceability in its information bundles (including their semantic components) and business processes;
    —     realizes specifications and descriptions from the traceability requirements as rules and guidelines, to provide recommendations or guidance on Open-edi practices; and,
    —     provides revised primitive Open-edi scenario templates for traceability, integrating the modifications to the template from other existing parts of ISO/IEC 15944 series.
    This document can be used by Open-edi implementers (including business modellers and system designers) and Open-edi standard developers in specifying Open-edi scenarios, developing Open-edi related standards, and implementing Open-edi rules and guidelines for Open-edi activities.
    This document does not specify the FSV aspects of traceability, internal behaviour requirements of an organization, or traceability as a metrological concept. Detailed exclusions to the scope of this document are provided in Annex H.
