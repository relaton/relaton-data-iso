abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: ISO/IEC 29341-4-4:2011(E) defines the layout of the AV Datastructure Template
    (AVDT) XML document. An AVDT document describes the format requirements and restrictions
    of various data structures used within the UPnP AV specifications. Its purpose
    is to enable each device to describe (at run-time) its particular variation of
    these AV data structures. AVDT documents allow users of AV data structures (e.g.
    UPnP control points) to reduce the number of instances of those data structures
    that comply with the service specification but are not compatible with the device's
    particular capabilities. The ultimate goal of an AVDT document is to reduce those
    error conditions that are caused by control points creating instances of a data
    structure that exceed the static (known) capabilities of the device. Unfortunately,
    the AVDT mechanism will never eliminate all preventable error conditions, but
    it will help to reduce them by giving the client more information about the device's
    particular capabilities. This International Standard replaces ISO/IEC 29341-4-4,
    first edition, published in 2008, and constitutes a technical revision.
