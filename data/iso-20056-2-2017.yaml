- content: |-
    ISO 20056-2:2017 specifies methods of calculating the static load ratings for hybrid bearings with bearing rings made of contemporary, commonly used, high quality hardened bearing steel, in accordance with good manufacturing practice, and a full set of rolling elements made of silicon nitride (Si3N4) in contemporary, commonly used material and manufacturing quality. For balls, ISO 26602,[4] together with ISO 3290‑2,[1] is applicable. For rollers, ISO 12297‑2[2] is applicable, and ISO 26602[4] is applicable in an analogous way.
    For applications where hybrid bearings are used, guideline values of the static safety factor, S0, according to Table 1 and Table 2 are observed.
