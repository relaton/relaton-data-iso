  content: Specifies requirements relating to the coatings intended to give protection
    against corrosion and as a base for other coatings. Requirements are concerned
    with surface preparation, method of application, electrical insulation resistance,
    adhesion, corrosion resistance, coating mass per unit area, coating mass significance,
    coating identification, sampling and test specimens, classification. Annex A describes
    qualitative testing of the layer composition, annex B gives treatment sequence
    options.
