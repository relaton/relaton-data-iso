abstract:
- content: |-
    ISO 20806:2009 specifies procedures to be adopted when balancing medium and large rotors installed in their own bearings on site. It addresses the conditions under which it is appropriate to undertake in-situ balancing, the instrumentation required, the safety implications and the requirements for reporting and maintaining records.
    ISO 20806:2009 can be used as a basis for a contract to undertake in-situ balancing.
    It does not provide guidance on the methods used to calculate the correction masses from measured vibration data.
