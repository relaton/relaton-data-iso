- content: |-
    ISO/TR 17870-1:2015 defines the quality of ceramic tiling and provides guidance for materials selection, installation and use, to achieve required levels of quality and performance.
    It considers aspects related to the specification and installation of the tiling project, in terms of:
    -      manufacture and distribution of the materials (ceramic tiles, adhesives, grouts, etc.);
    -      specification of the tiling;
    -      installation of the tiling (tile fixing operations).
    It is applicable to internal and external floor and wall ceramic tiling, installed by either cement mortar or other adhesive methods.
    NOTE          The quality of ceramic tiling depends on the following general characteristics:
    -      regularity;
    -      durability;
    -      safety.
    The durability of the tiling can depend on its use and management.
