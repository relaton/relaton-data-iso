  content: ISO/TR 7861:2002 presents injury risk curves that can be used for injury
    risk assessment in the evaluation of occupant protection in road-vehicle frontal
    impact. The measurements were made on frontal-impact crash test dummies which
    present acceptable levels of biofidelity response in accordance with ISO 12349-1
    and ISO 12349-2 and which are used in the frontal-impact test procedures of existing
    International Standards.
