    This document specifies requirements for five types of hose and hose assembly used in automobile power-steering systems, the five types differing in their pressure ratings and volumetric expansion. They are for use with fluids in the temperature range −40 °C to +135 °C.
    This document is based on performance tests. In order to take account of technological developments, no requirements are included for specific materials, detailed construction or manufacturing methods.
