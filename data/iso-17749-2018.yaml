    This document specifies requirements for factory-made products of sheep wool, which are used for the thermal insulation of buildings. This document applies to material containing more than 50 % (by mass) natural sheep wool, with the balance being polymeric material. The products are delivered as a mat or board with or without facings.
    This document describes product characteristics and testing methods, marking, labelling and packaging.
    Products covered in this document are also used in prefabricated thermal insulation systems and composite panels; the performance of systems incorporating these products is not covered.
    The sheep wool mat and board thermal insulation is not to be used when the continuous service temperature of the substrate is outside the range of −60 °C to +80 °C.
    The use of mothproof agent residues is outside the scope of this document.
    This document does not address all the health and safety aspects associated with its use. It is the responsibility of the user of this document to establish appropriate health and safety practices.
