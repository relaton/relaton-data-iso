    personal mobility services (PMS). \nThe users of PMS ride personal mobility devices
    (PMD), which are empowered by electricity or human, and interact with the PMS
    through the VUI attached to the PMD. \nThe functional requirements, the performance
    requirements, and the procedure of the VUI are described in the document. This
    document is applicable to a VUI attached to a PMD, which can be used for interaction
    between users and the PMD."
