abstract:
- content: The soap is dissolved in ethanol, filtrated and the undissolved residue
    is weighed. The constituents not dissolved correspond to the additives and foreign
    matter, of low solubility or insolubility in 95 % (V/V) ethanol, added to soaps
    and also to substances in all soap formulations, such as alkali carbonates and
    chlorides, borates, perborates, suphates, silicates, phosphates etc. It also may
    consist of organic substances like starches, dextrins, caseins, sugars, cellulose
    derivatives, alginates, etc.
