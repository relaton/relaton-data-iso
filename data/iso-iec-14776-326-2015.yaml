  script: Latn
  content: ISO/IEC 14776-326:2015(E) defines a Reduced Block Command set for logical
    block devices. The Reduced Block Commands along with the required SPC-2 commands
    and their restrictions described in this   standard, fully specify the complete
    command set for RBC logical block devices. It provides a command set of reduced
    requirements and options from SCSI Block Commands (SBC) (ISO/IEC 14776-321) for
    block devices. The reduced command set is intended to more closely match the functionality
    required for simple block logical units. The specified commands place no restrictions
    on device performance. The initial focus of this command set was to enable rigid
    disks and removable media devices attached to Serial Bus and utilizing SBP-2 (ISO/IEC
    14776-232) for command and control. This second edition cancels and replaces the
    first edition published in 2002 and constitutes a minor revision. This second
    edition provides additional explanations and corrects mistakes with respect to
    the first edition.
