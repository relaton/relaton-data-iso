    This document specifies the principles of particle size analysis by gravitational sedimentation, the principal types of measurement techniques as well as the general rules for conducting measurements, method validation, determination of the uncertainty budget and representation of results.
    This document covers neither particle migration by centrifugal, electric or magnetic forces nor sedimentation at high particle concentrations (e.g. zone sedimentation). Moreover, this document does not deal with the determination of properties other than sedimentation velocity and particle size (i.e. neither particle concentration, particle shape, particle density, zeta-potential nor apparent viscosity).
    NOTE            This document can involve hazardous materials, operations and equipment. This document does not purport to address all the safety problems associated with its use. Explosion proof analysers are required when examining volatile liquids with a low flash point.
