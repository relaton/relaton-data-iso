abstract:
- content: "This International Standard specifies the test method to evaluate the
    assistance/enhancement performance of the lower-limb wearable robots by using
    an anthropomorphic test dummy robot (ATDR). ATDR wears the lower-limb wearable
    robot and runs test instead of a human thereby ensuring the objectivity and repeatability
    of the test. This International Standard is applied to all wearable robots that
    operate by being connected to lower limbs regardless of the purpose of use and
    the driving method (powered/non-powered, electric/hydraulic). \n\nThis standard
    does not apply to the lower-limb wearable robots that operate based on biosignals
    such as electromyography (EMG)."
