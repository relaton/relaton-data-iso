abstract:
- content: Gives the requirements for two classes of single-hole fixing switches for
    use in nominal 28 V d. c. and 115/200 V three-phase, 400 Hz a.c. systems. Class
    1 switches are sealed and are suitable for higher altitude and temperature conditions
    than are Class 2 switches, which are sealed only at the lever entry. Furthermore,
    gives requirements for dimensions, operation, construction, voltage and current
    ratings, environment, tests, type tests, production tests, quality tests, declarations
    and marking.
