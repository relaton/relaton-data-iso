abstract:
- content: The method is based on determination by measuring the distance between
    the planes of the pile surface located under a standard pressure and the plane
    of the backing surface located under a standard loading. This method and that
    of ISO 1766 may not give identical results. In case of dispute or where maximum
    accuracy is required, thickness shall be determined by the method of ISO 1766.
