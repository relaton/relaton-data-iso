abstract:
- content: |-
    This document establishes general rules for qualification assessment of space systems and products used in space systems against their functional and technical specifications. It establishes general requirements for determining system or product readiness for any stage of the life cycle. This includes, for example, readiness for development, manufacture, test, operation, modification, or disposal.
    This document is applicable to systems and products used in flight or ground support and to products at all levels in a product tree. It applies to systems and products consisting of hardware, software, facilities, materials, methods, processes, procedures or any combination of these.
    It establishes common:
    a) general requirements for qualification assessment of item readiness;
    b) approaches to qualification.
    This document is intended for use as the basis for a design justification plan. It is intended to be used either in establishing an agreement for such a plan between a customer and a supplier or as the basis for a supplier’s internal qualification practices.
