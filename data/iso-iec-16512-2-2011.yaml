  script: Latn
  content: "ISO/IEC 16512-2:2011 specifies the relayed multicast protocol for simplex
    group applications (RMCP-2), an application-layer protocol, which constructs a
    multicast tree for data delivery from one sender to multiple receivers over the
    Internet where IP multicast is not fully deployed.\nIt defines a basic RMCP-2
    protocol without security features, and a secure RMCP-2 protocol that adds security
    features to the basic protocol. Both protocols specify a series of functions and
    procedures for multicast agents to construct a one-to-many relayed data path and
    to relay simplex data. They also specify the operations of the session manager
    to manage multicast sessions.\nThese protocols can be used for applications that
    require one-to-many data delivery services, such as multimedia streaming services
    or file dissemination services.\nISO/IEC 16512-2:2011 also defines a membership
    authentication procedure for use with the secure RMCP-2 protocol and provides
    informative material related to the protocols.  "
