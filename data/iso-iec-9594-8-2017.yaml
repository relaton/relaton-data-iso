abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 9594-8:2017 addresses some of the security requirements in the
    areas of authentication and other security services through the provision of a
    set of frameworks upon which full services can be based. Specifically, this Recommendation
    | International Standard defines frameworks for:\n-      public-key certificates;
    and\n-      attribute certificates.\nThe public-key certificate framework defined
    in this Recommendation | International Standard specifies the information objects
    and data types for a public-key infrastructure (PKI), including public-key certificates,
    certificate revocation lists (CRLs), trust broker and authorization and validation
    lists (AVLs). The attribute certificate framework specifies the information objects
    and data types for a privilege management infrastructure (PMI), including attribute
    certificates, and attribute certificate revocation lists (ACRLs). This Recommendation
    | International Standard also provides the framework for issuing, managing, using
    and revoking certificates. An extensibility mechanism is included in the defined
    formats for both certificate types and for all revocation list schemes. This Recommendation
    | International Standard also includes a set of extensions, which is expected
    to be generally useful across a number of applications of PKI and PMI. The schema
    components (including object classes, attribute types and matching rules) for
    storing PKI and PMI information in a directory, are included in this Recommendation
    | International Standard. \nISO/IEC 9594-8:2017 specifies the framework for strong
    authentication, involving credentials formed using cryptographic techniques. It
    is not intended to establish this as a general framework for authentication, but
    it can be of general use for applications which consider these techniques adequate.
    \nAuthentication (and other security services) can only be provided within the
    context of a defined security policy. It is a matter for users of an application
    to define their own security policy."
