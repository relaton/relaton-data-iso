    This document describes the following:
    -      polling for proximity cards or objects (PICCs) entering the field of a proximity coupling device (PCD);
    -      the byte format, the frames and timing used during the initial phase of communication between PCDs and PICCs;
    -      the initial Request and Answer to Request command content;
    -      methods to detect and communicate with one PICC among several PICCs (anticollision);
    -      other parameters required to initialize communications between a PICC and PCD;
    -      optional means to ease and speed up the selection of one PICC among several PICCs based on application criteria;
    -      optional capability to allow a device to alternate between the functions of a PICC and a PCD to communicate with a PCD or a PICC, respectively. A device which implements this capability is called a PXD.
    Protocol and commands used by higher layers and by applications and which are used after the initial phase are described in ISO/IEC 14443‑4.
    This document is applicable to PICCs of Type A and of Type B (as described in ISO/IEC 14443‑2), to PCDs (as described in ISO/IEC 14443‑2) and to PXDs.
    NOTE 1    Part of the timing of data communication is defined in ISO/IEC 14443‑2.
    NOTE 2    Test methods for this document are defined in ISO/IEC 10373‑6.
