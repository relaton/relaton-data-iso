  content: This document specifies a procedure by which the intensity scale of an
    X-ray photoelectron spectrometer which employs a concentric hemispherical analyser
    can be calibrated using low-density poly(ethylene). This document is applicable
    to instruments using quartz-crystal-monochromated Al Kα X-rays and is suitable
    for all instrument geometries. The intensity calibration is only valid for the
    specific settings of the instrument (pass energy or retardation ratio, lens mode,
    slit and aperture settings) used during the calibration procedure. The intensity
    calibration is suitable for intensity calibration at kinetic energies higher than
    180 eV. This document is not applicable to XPS instruments which do not have a
    low energy electron flood source or instruments that have a non-linear intensity
    response. This document is not applicable to instruments and operating modes which
    generate significant intensity from electrons scattered internally in the spectrometer.
