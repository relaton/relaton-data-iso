    This International Standard specifies the characteristics of triers for green coffee or raw coffee and for
    parchment coffee (coffee in parchment) suitable for taking samples through the sides of closed bags and which
    is particularly suitable for sampling based on ISO 4072[1].
    This International Standard is applicable to triers neither for sampling from bulk container liners nor from "big
    bags" [e.g. bags designated "1 MT" or "1 Mt" (metric tonne)].
