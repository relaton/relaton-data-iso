    This part of ISO/IEC 8859 specifies a set of 146
    coded graphic characters identified as Latin/Arabic
    alphabet.
    This set of coded graphic characters is intended for
    use in data and text processing applications and
    also for information interchange.
    The set contains graphic characters used for
    general purpose applications in typical office
    environments in at least the following languages:
    Arabic, English and Latin.
    Some of the characters in this set are combining
    characters (see clause 6).
    This set of coded graphic characters may be
    regarded as a version of an 8-bit code according to
    ISO/IEC 2022 or ISO/IEC 4873 at level 1.
    This part of ISO/IEC 8859 may not be used in
    conjunction with any other parts of ISO/IEC 8859.
    If coded characters from more than one part are to
    be used together, by means of code extension
    techniques, the equivalent coded character sets
    from ISO/IEC 10367 should be used instead within
    a version of ISO/IEC 4873 at level 2 or level 3.
    The coded characters in this set may be used in
    conjunction with coded control functions selected
    from ISO/IEC 6429. However, control functions are
    not used to create composite graphic symbols from
    two or more graphic characters (see clause 6).
    NOTE ? ISO/IEC 8859 is not intended for use with
    Telematic services defined by ITU-T. If information coded
    according to ISO/IEC 8859 is to be transferred to such
    services, it will have to conform to the requirements of
    those services at the access-point.
