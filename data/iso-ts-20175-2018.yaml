abstract:
- content: "This document describes procedures to characterize quadrupole mass spectrometers
    (QMSs) with an ion source of electron impact ionization and which are designed
    for the measurement of atomic mass-to-charge ratios m/z < 300. \nThis document
    is not applicable to QMSs with other ion sources, such as chemical ionization,
    photo-ionization or field ionization sources and for the measurements of higher
    m/z, which are mainly used to specify organic materials.\nIt is well known from
    published investigations on the metrological characteristics of quadrupole mass
    spectrometers that their indications of partial pressures depend significantly
    on the settings of the instrument, the total pressure, and the composition of
    the gas mixture. For this reason, it is not possible to calibrate a quadrupole
    mass spectrometer for all possible kinds of use. The characterization procedures
    described in this document cover the applications of continuous leak monitoring
    of a vacuum system, leak rate measurement with tracer gas, residual gas analysis
    and outgassing rate measurements. The user can select that characterization procedure
    that best suits his or her needs. These characterization procedures can also be
    useful for other applications.\nIt is also well known that the stability of several
    parameters of quadrupole mass spectrometers, in particular sensitivity, are rather
    poor. Therefore, when a parameter has been calibrated, it needs frequent recalibration
    when accuracy is required. For practical reasons this can only be accomplished
    by in situ calibrations. To this end, this document not only describes how a quadrupole
    mass spectrometer can be calibrated by a calibration laboratory or a National
    Metrological Institute with direct traceability to the System International (SI),
    but also how calibrated parameters can be frequently checked and maintained in
    situ.\nBy their physical principle, quadrupole mass spectrometers need high vacuum
    within the instrument. By reducing dimensions or by special ion sources combined
    with differential pumping the operational range can be extended to higher pressures,
    up to atmospheric pressure. This document, however, does not include quadrupole
    mass spectrometers with differential pumping technology. Therefore, it does not
    cover pressures exceeding 1 Pa on the inlet flange of the quadrupole mass spectrometer.\nThis
    document does not describe how the initial adjustment of a quadrupole mass spectrometer
    by the manufacturer or by a service given order by the manufacturer should be
    made. The purpose of such an initial adjustment is mainly to provide a correct
    m/z scale, constant mass resolution or constant transmission, and is very specific
    to the instrument. Instead, it is assumed for this document that a manufacturer's
    readjustment procedure exists which can be carried on-site by a user. This procedure
    is intended to ensure that the quadrupole mass spectrometer is in a well-defined
    condition for the characterization.\nIt is the intention of this document that
    the user gets the best possible metrological quality from his quadrupole mass
    spectrometer. From investigations it is known that in most cases this can be achieved
    in the so called \"scan mode\". The bar graph may also be of an adequate quality
    depending on the software used for evaluation of the data taken by the quadrupole
    mass spectrometer. The trend mode, however, often involves the additional uncertainty
    that a shift of the peak value position on the mass scale causes a shift in ion
    current. For this reason, the scan mode is preferable for most of the measurement
    procedures of this document.\nIt is not the intent of this document that all the
    parameters described be determined for each quadrupole mass spectrometer. However,
    it is intended that the value of a parameter addressed in this document be determined
    according to the procedure described in this document if it is given or measured
    (e.g. for an inspection test).\nIt is assumed for this document that the applicant
    is familiar with both the operation of quadrupole mass spectrometers and high
    and ultra-high vacuum technology."
