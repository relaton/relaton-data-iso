abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 29341-20-10:2017 is compliant with UPnP Device Architecture version
    1.0 [14]. \nThis service type enables control over the transport of audio and
    video streams. The service type defines a common model for A/V transport control
    suitable for a generic user interface. It can be used to control a wide variety
    of disc, tape and solid-state based media devices such as CD players, VCRs and
    MP3 players. A minimal implementation of this service can be used to control tuners.
    \nThe service type is related to the ConnectionManager service type, which describes
    A/V connection setup procedures, and the ContentDirectory service, which offers
    meta-information about the resource stored on the media. AVTransport also offers
    an action to retrieve any metadata embedded in the resource itself. \nThis service
    type does not offer scheduled recording."
