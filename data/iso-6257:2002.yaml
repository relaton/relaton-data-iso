abstract:
- content: "ISO 6257:2002 specifies methods for sampling and preparing samples prior
    to testing of binder pitch used in the manufacture of electrodes for the electrolytic
    production of aluminium. \nThese methods are applicable to grades of pitch in
    liquid or solid form, the latter having softening points higher than 30 °C (determined
    according to the method specified in ISO 5940), in bulk, or in a number of containers
    making up one batch at sites of manufacture, storage, or delivery. Sampling methods
    and sampling plans for large consignments, or lots, of pitch in liquid form during
    the loading and unloading of ships are included."
