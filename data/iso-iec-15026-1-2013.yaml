    ISO/IEC 15026-1:2013 defines assurance-related terms and establishes an organized set of concepts and their relationships, thereby establishing a basis for shared understanding of the concepts and principles central to all parts of ISO/IEC 15026 across its user communities. It provides information to users of the subsequent parts of ISO/IEC 15026, including the use of each part and the combined use of multiple parts.
    Coverage of assurance for a service being operated and managed on an ongoing basis is not covered in ISO/IEC 15026.
