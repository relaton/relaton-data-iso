    ISO/TR 17329:2015 provides an inventory, as far as known at time of publication, of manufacturer's identification marks and their assigned radio frequency identification (RFID) codes according to ISO 21007-1 and ISO 21007-2. The listing includes marks of existing gas cylinder manufacturers, as well as cylinder manufacturers which have ceased production in the past, but whose cylinders can still be in service today.
    NOTE          It is intended to revise Annex A of this Technical Report from time to time in order to update the list of codes and identification marks of gas cylinder manufacturers in accordance with the progressing commercial and economic development in the cylinder manufacturing industry.
    Any request for inclusion or modification of these identifications is to be made to the ISO/TC 58/SC 4 Secretariat, who would update the information in Annex A after consultation with the committee leadership.
