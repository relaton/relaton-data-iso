    This international standard specifies a test method for microbiologically influenced corrosion of oil and gas transmission pipelines, including the principle, apparatus, sources of strains, solutions, specimens, sterilization, procedure, results and report.
    This document is applicable to corrosion evaluations, materials selection, performance limitations of specific metallic materials, and assessment of MIC prevention such as bactericides application.
