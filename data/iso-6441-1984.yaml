abstract:
- content: The test method is applicable on a single or multi-coat system. The result
    is expressed as the depth of indentation produced when an indentor of specified
    or between the interested parties agreed size and shape is applied to the coating
    under defined conditions. The method is applicable if the identation does not
    exceed approximately 10 % of the total coating thickness. The indentation apparatus
    shall be constructed so that the contact load and the test load can successively
    be applied to an indentor.
