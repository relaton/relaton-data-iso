    This part of ISO 10303 specifies the interpretation of the generic resources for the definition of an elementary
    boundary representation model.
    The following are within the scope of this part of ISO 10303:
    — the definition of an elementary_brep_shape_representation, this is a representation composed
    of one or more manifold_solid_breps each of which is defined with elementary geometry and
    complete explicit topology;
    — the definition of the unbounded geometry of curves and surfaces used in the definition of the faces
    of such a B-rep model;
    — the definition of the topological structure of a B-rep model;
    — 3D geometry;
    — B-reps;
    — elementary curves, these are lines or conics;
    — elementary_surfaces;
    — geometric transformations;
    — polylines;
    — unbounded geometry;
    — use of topology to bound geometric entities.
    The following are outside the scope of this part of ISO 10303:
    — 2D geometry;
    — bounded curves other than polylines;
    — bounded surfaces
    — offset curves and surfaces.
    This AIC is independent of any industrial application domain.
