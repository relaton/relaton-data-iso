    systems engineering agility, and\n-\tprovides guidelines for their selection and
    application.\nThis part of ISO/IEC/IEEE 24748 is applicable to\n-\tthose who use
    or plan to use ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 on projects dealing with man-made systems including
    software-intensive systems, software products, and services related to those systems
    and products,\n-\tthose who are responsible for the technical management of projects
    concerned with the engineering of systems,\n-\tthose responsible for executing
    ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 system life cycle processes at a project level, and\n-\torganizations
    and individuals who are seeking to improve their capability to deal with uncertain
    knowledge and dynamic environments."
