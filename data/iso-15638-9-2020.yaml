    This document addresses the provision of ?Remote Digital Tachograph Monitoring' and specifies the form and content of the transmission of such data required to support such systems, and access methods to that data.
    This document provides specifications for common communications and data exchange aspects of the application service remote digital tachograph monitoring that a jurisdiction regulator can elect to require or support as an option, including:
    a)   High level definition of the service that a service provider provides. The service definition describes common service elements but does not define the detail of how such an application service is instantiated, nor the acceptable value ranges of the data concepts defined.
    b)   Means to realize the service.
    c)   Application data naming, content and quality that an IVS delivers, including a number of profiles for data (noting that requirements and constraints of what can/cannot be transmitted over the air can vary between jurisdictions).
    d)   Support for a number of defined communication profiles to enable remote inspection.
    This document is not applicable for analogue tachograph equipment/systems.
    This document provides specifications for the following communication profiles:
    —     Communication Profile C1: Roadside inspection using a short-range wireless communication interrogator instigating a physical roadside inspection (master<>slave)
    Profile C1a: via a hand aimed or temporary roadside mounted and aimed interrogator
    Profile C1b: via a vehicle mounted and directed interrogator
    Profile C1c: via a permanent or semi-permanent roadside or overhead gantry
    —          Communication Profile C2: Roadside inspection using a short-range wireless communication interrogator instigating a download of data to an application service provider via an ITS-station communication (master<>slave + peer<>peer)
    Profile C2a: via a hand aimed or temporary roadside mounted and aimed interrogator
    Profile C2b: via a vehicle mounted and directed interrogator
    Profile C2c: via a permanent or semi-permanent roadside or overhead gantry
    —     Communication Profile C3: Remote inspection addressed via an ITS-station instigating a download of data to an application service provider via a wireless communications interface (as defined in ISO 15638‑2).
    It is possible that subsequent versions of this document will support additional communication profiles.
    NOTE 1  The definition of what comprises a ?regulated' service is regarded as an issue for national decision and can vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. This document does not impose any requirements on nations in respect of which services for regulated vehicles jurisdictions will require, or support as an option, but provides standardized sets of requirements descriptions for identified services to enable consistent and cost-efficient implementations where instantiated.
    NOTE 2  The ISO 15638 series has been developed for use in the context of regulated commercial freight vehicles (hereinafter referred to as ?regulated vehicles'). However, there is nothing to prevent a jurisdiction from extending or adapting the scope to include other types of regulated vehicles, as it deems appropriate.
