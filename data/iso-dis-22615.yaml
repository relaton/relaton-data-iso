abstract:
- content: "This document specifies requirements and test methods for materials and
    seams of re-usable and single use protective clothing providing protection of
    the wearer against infective biological agents. Design criteria, mechanical requirements,
    and functional fit requirements are basd on either ISO 16602 series or by the
    ISO 20384 as indicated in this document, while the barrier properties of this
    document will be additive to ensure the protection against infective biological
    agents.\n\nNOTE\tThis standard is a standalone standard but using requirements
    based on ISO 16602 series and ISO 20384.\n\nFor products intended for the dual
    use as both a PPE and as a medical gown, both this document and the ISO 20384
    shall apply.\n\nClothing worn by surgical teams or drapes laid on patients to
    prevent cross-contamination during surgical interventions are not covered by the
    scope of this document, but are covered solely by ISO 20384.\n\nThis document
    not applicable to components such as gloves, boots, eye/face protection devices
    and respiratory protective devices as their performance criteria are given in
    other standards.  However, when these components are either an integral part of
    the protective clothing ensemble or are tested separately as partial body protection,
    supplementary requirements are provided in this standard. This document does not
    cover requirements for antimicrobial treatments for protective clothing."
