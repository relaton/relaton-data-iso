    This document specifies the transformation of SysML (ISO/IEC 19514:2017) constructs to XSD (World Wide Web Consortium's XML schema definition language) constructs for the purpose of representing the SysML model represented in XMI (ISO/IEC 19509:2014) as XML (World Wide Web Consortium's XML) schemas. The specified mapping is a one-way transformation from SysML information model represented in XMI into an XML schema. These limitations make the mapping unsuitable for the transformation of arbitrary SysML models to XML schemas.
    The following are within the scope of this document:
    —    the specification of the structure, components, and conventions of the XSD for the STEP (ISO 10303-1) XML implementation method;
    —    the transformation of SysML metamodel constructs represented in XMI to XSD constructs for the purpose of representing SysML information models as XML schemas.
    The following are outside the scope of this document:
    —    the transformation of SysML metamodel constructs into XSD constructs that are not used in the STEP extended architecture;
    —    the transformation of SysML metamodel constructs into XSD constructs for other purposes than representing SysML constructs as STEP concepts;
    —    codes and scripts to transform SysML XMI to XSD schema;
    —    the transformation of SysML constraints (OCL, see ISO/IEC 19507) into Schematron (see ISO/IEC 19757‑3).
