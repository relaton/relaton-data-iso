    This document provides information and specifications on the management of road traffic in controlled zones (CZ) through the application of geofencing. Specifically, this document specifies a “Controlled Zone Data Dictionary” (CZDD) for management of controlled zones, and provides an extendible toolkit that regulators can use, for example, to inform potential CZ users (e.g. vehicles) about:
    —     the CZ area, i.e. the geographical boundaries of the CZ;
    —     CZ access conditions including exemptions;
    —     time windows indicating when these CZ access conditions are applicable.
    This allows potential CZ users to select an appropriate routing, either by pre-trip planning or ad hoc re-routing.
    This document also provides illustrations and guidelines on how to use this toolkit.
    The toolkit is designed in accordance with the general ITS station and communications architecture specified in ISO 21217, and with optionally applicable C-ITS protocols and procedures, e.g. ISO 22418 on “Service Announcement”, ISO 18750 on the “Local Dynamic Map”, and ISO 17419 on globally unique identifiers. Cybersecurity provision can be provided through conformance to ISO 21177.
    Enforcement is out of scope of this document.
