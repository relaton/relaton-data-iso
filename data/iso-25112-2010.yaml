  content: "ISO 25112:2010 selects the options appropriate for CALM using mobile wireless
    broadband (MWB) techniques conforming to IEEE 802.16, and specifies the management
    interface requirements.\nCALM links are required for quasi-continuous, prolonged
    and short communications between vehicles and the roadside, between vehicles,
    and between mobile equipment and fixed infrastructure points.\nWherever practicable,
    ISO 25112:2010 has been developed by reference to suitable extant standards, adopted
    by selection. Required regional variations are provided.  \nApplication specific
    upper layers will not be included in ISO 25112:2010, but will be driven by application
    standards (which might not be technology specific)."
