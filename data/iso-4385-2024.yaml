    This document specifies a method for compression testing of bearing materials. It is applicable for both bulk materials and coatings.
    Compression testing within the meaning of this document serves for the determination of the behaviour of bearing materials under uniaxial compression loading which is uniformly distributed over the cross-section. For this purpose, a cylindrical specimen or a setup of two such specimen, with an original cross-section, A0, is loaded at constant crosshead speed and the resulting compressive stress and compressive strain are recorded.
