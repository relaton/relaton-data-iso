abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 17343:2004 specifies signalling interworking between "QSIG" and
    the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) in support of basic services within a corporate
    telecommunication network (CN). "QSIG" is a signalling protocol that operates
    between Private Integrated Services eXchanges (PINX) within a Private Integrated
    Services Network (PISN). A PISN provides circuit-switched basic services and supplementary
    services to its users. QSIG is specified in other Standards, in particular ISO/IEC
    11572 (call control in support of basic services), ISO/IEC 11582 (generic functional
    protocol for the support of supplementary services) and a number of Standards
    specifying individual supplementary services. SIP is an application layer protocol
    for establishing, terminating and modifying multimedia sessions. It is typically
    carried over the Internet Protocol (IP) (IETF RFC 791 and IETF RFC 2460). Telephone
    calls are considered as a type of multimedia session where just audio is exchanged.
    SIP is defined in IETF RFC 3261.
