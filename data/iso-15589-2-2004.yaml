abstract:
- content: |-
    ISO 15589-2:2004 specifies requirements and gives recommendations for the pre-installation surveys, design, materials, equipment, fabrication, installation, commissioning, operation, inspection and maintenance of cathodic protection systems for offshore pipelines for the petroleum and natural gas industries as defined in ISO 13623.
    ISO 15589-2:2004 is applicable to carbon and stainless steel pipelines in offshore service.
    ISO 15589-2:2004 is applicable to retrofits, modifications and repairs made to existing pipeline systems.
    ISO 15589-2:2004 is applicable to all types of seawater and seabed environments encountered in submerged conditions and on risers up to mean water level.
    Note that special conditions sometimes exist where cathodic protection is ineffective or only partially effective. Such conditions can include elevated temperatures, disbonded coatings, thermal insulating coatings, shielding, bacterial attack, and unusual contaminants in the electrolyte.
