abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 29431-18-10:2011(E) describes a service definition which is compliant
    with the UPnP Device Architecture version 1.0. It defines a service type referred
    to herein as InboundConnectionConfig service. The InboundConnectionConfig service
    is a UPnP service that allows control points to configure the parameters that
    will enable the service to test if the host device is reachable from the internet.
    InboundConnectionConfig uses Dynamic DNS to manage at least one public address
    for home-network services; it uses STUN to ensure that any intermediate NAT device
    is navigatable, i.e. it is a\nfull-cone NAT. Thus, this service provides control
    points with the following functionality:                                \n- Configure
    the dynamic DNS client co-located with the service,                                                                \n-
    Configure the STUN client co-located with the service,    \n- Check if the device
    hosting the service is reachable from the internet."
