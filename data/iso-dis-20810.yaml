abstract:
- content: "This document specifies the definition and technical criteria for whole
    grain as a food ingredient (raw material), including requirements for designating
    whole-grain foods on packaging, labelling and claims. \nThe document is applicable
    to business-to-business (B2B) as well as business-to-consumer (B2C)communication,
    to food trade and to food labelling and claims.\nThe definition and technical
    criteria for whole grain as a food ingredient are generic and not specific to
    particular whole-grain types. It does not include any detailed criteria or technical
    guidance for specific types of grains (e.g.,“whole-grain wheat”).\nThe definition
    and technical criteria apply only post-harvest/collecting."
