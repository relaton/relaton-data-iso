abstract:
- content: |-
    This document provides guidance for achieving and demonstrating safety of an automated driving system (ADS) integrated in a road vehicle. The approach is based on safety principles derived from worldwide applicable publications and top-level safety objectives. It considers safety by design, verification and validation, and post deployment activities for level 3 and level 4 ADS features defined according to ISO/SAE PAS 22736[2]. In addition, it outlines cybersecurity considerations.
    The application of this document is intended for road vehicles, including trucks and buses and excluding motorcycles and mopeds.
    Any ADS or related elements that are in operation, or under development, prior to the publication of this document are exempted from the application of this document.
    NOTE         While not covered in this document, safety during development activities is a key consideration. Development includes activities of design, verification and validation.
