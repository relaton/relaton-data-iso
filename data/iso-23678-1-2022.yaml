abstract:
- content: |-
    This document establishes a uniform, safe and consistent approach to training personnel to enable them to establish and maintain the required competencies in relation to maintenance, thorough examination, operational testing, overhaul and repair of lifeboats and rescue boats, launching appliances and release gear.
    It also provides the necessary information for interested parties to grant authorization and effectively evaluate and audit training, supporting the IMO Requirements, section 3.
    It describes the competence route, resources, facilities and certification requirements for personnel trained by a manufacturer or by an authorized service provider to carry out maintenance, thorough examination, operational testing, overhaul and repair of lifeboats (including free-fall lifeboats) and rescue boats (including fast rescue boats), launching appliances and release gear. This document also sets out the competence route of the candidate, and the resources that the training provider needs to deliver the training.
    This document is intended to be used in conjunction with ISO 23678-2, ISO 23678-3 and ISO 23678-4.
