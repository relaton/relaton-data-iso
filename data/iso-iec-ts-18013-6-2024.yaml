  content: "This document specifies test methods for testing conformity of a mobile
    driving licence (mDL) or an mDL reader to ISO/IEC 18013-5. This document specifies
    test methods for:\n—     mDL on its interface to an mDL reader;\n—     mDL reader
    on its interface to an mDL; \n—     mDL reader on its (optional) interface to
    an issuing authority infrastructure.\nTest cases for an issuing authority infrastructure
    on its interface to an mDL reader are not included in this document.\nTest cases
    for the use of OIDC by an mDL reader on its interface to an issuing authority
    infrastructure are not included in this document. This document only provides
    test cases for the use of WebAPI on this interface.\nThis document only addresses
    the functional behaviour of an implementation under test (IUT) on its interface(s)
    in scope. It does not address:\n—     the internal implementation of an IUT, such
    as a secure area in an mDL;\n—     any functional requirements to an IUT not specified
    in ISO/IEC 18013-5, for example, requirements of a particular issuing authority;\n—    
    non-functional aspects of the IUT, nor IUT interfaces not listed above, such as
    the interface from an issuing authority infrastructure to an mDL, used to provision
    mDL data."
