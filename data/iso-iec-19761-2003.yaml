    ISO/IEC 19761:2003 specifies the set of definitions, conventions and activities of the COSMIC-FFP Functional Size Measurement Method. It is applicable to software from the following functional domains:
    ISO/IEC 19761:2003 has not been designed for measuring the functional size of a piece of software, or its parts, which:
    However, within the local environment of an organisation using the COSMIC-FFP Functional Size Measurement Method, it may be possible to measure these FUR in a way which is meaningful as a local standard. ISO/IEC 19761:2003 contains provision for the local customisation of the method for this purpose.
