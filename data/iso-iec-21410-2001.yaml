    This International Standard specifies signalling interworking between "QSIG" and "H.323" in support of the call transfer
    supplementary services within a Corporate telecommunication Network (CN).
    "QSIG" is a signalling protocol that operates at the Q reference point between Private Integrated Services eXchanges (PINX)
    within a Private Integrated Services Network (PISN). The Q reference point is defined in ISO/IEC 11579-1. A PISN provides
    circuit-switched basic services and supplementary services to its users. QSIG is specified in other Standards, in particular
    ISO/IEC 11572 (call control in support of basic services), ISO/IEC 11582 (generic functional protocol for the support of
    supplementary services) and a number of standards specifying individual supplementary services. ISO/IEC 13869 specifies the
    QSIG protocol in support of call transfer by consultation and ISO/IEC 19460 specifies the QSIG protocol in support of single
    step call transfer.
    "H.323" is a set of signalling protocols for the support of voice or multimedia communication within a packet network, in
    particular a packet network that uses the Internet Protocol (IP) as its network layer protocol (IP network). H.323 signalling
    protocols operate between endpoints in an IP network, either indirectly via one or more gatekeepers, or directly. An endpoint
    can be a terminal or a gateway to another network. H.323 is an "umbrella" recommendation referring to various ITU-T
    recommendations, in particular Recommendations H.225.0 and H.245 (basic communication capabilities) and
    Recommendation H.450.1 (generic functional protocol for the support of supplementary services). Recommendation H.450.2
    specifies the H.323 protocol in support of call transfer.
    NOTE - H.450.2 applies only to the 1998 version of H.323 (also known as H.323 version 2) and to later versions.
    Call transfer by consultation, as supported by ISO/IEC 13869, is a supplementary service that enables a user (user A) to
    transform two of that user's calls (at least one of which must be answered) into a new call between the two other users in the two
    calls (users B and C).
    Single step call transfer, as supported by ISO/IEC 19460, is a supplementary service that enables a user (user A) to transform
    an existing call between user A and user B into a new call between user B and user C without user A needing to establish a call
    with user C prior to transfer.
    Call transfer, as supported by H.450.2, is a supplementary service that enables the served user (user A) to transform an existing
    call with a second user (user B) into a new call between user B and a third user (user C) selected by user A. User A may or may
    not have a call established with user C prior to call transfer. If a call is already established between user A and user C, this is
    known as transfer by consultation and is equivalent to call transfer as supported by ISO/IEC 13869. If a call is not already
    established between user A and user C, this is known as single step call transfer and is equivalent to call transfer as supported
    by ISO/IEC 19460.
    Interworking between QSIG and H.323 permits a call originating at a user of a PISN to terminate at a user of an IP network, or
    a call originating at a user of an IP network to terminate at a user of a PISN. This International Standard provides the following
    additional capabilities:
    _ a PISN user with two calls established, at least one of which being to or from a user in an IP network, to be able to
    transform those two calls into a new call between the other two users involved;
    _ a PISN user with a call established to or from a user in an IP network to be able to transform that call into a new call
    between the IP network user and a third user selected by the PISN user, that third user being either in the IP network or in
    the PISN;
    _ a PISN user with a call established to a second PISN user to be able to transfer that call into a new call between the second
    user and a third user selected by the first user, that third user being in an IP network;
    _ an IP network user with two calls established, at least one of which being to or from a user in a PISN, to be able to
    transform those two calls into a new call between the other two users involved;
    _ an IP network user with a call established to or from a user in a PISN to be able to transform that call into a new call
    between the PISN user and a third user selected by the IP network user, that third user being either in the IP network or in
    the PISN; and

    _ an IP network user with a call established to a second user in the IP network to be able to transfer that call into a new call

    This International Standard is applicable to any interworking unit that can act as a gateway between a PISN employing QSIG
    and an IP network employing H.323.
