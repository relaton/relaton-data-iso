    This document specifies examples of application-specific requirements, recommendations and best practices in data acquisition applicable to gait image sequence data. Its typical applications include:
    a) support for human examination of high-resolution video and still images;
    b) support for human biometric verification and identification based on video and still images;
    c) automated gait image sequence verification and identification.
    This document ensures that image sequences are suitable for human identification and human verification generated by video surveillance and other similar systems.
    The following topics are not in scope of this document:
    —    Definitions for facial and/or full body image related biometric profiles, which are fully covered in ISO/IEC 39794-5 and ISO/IEC 39794-16 respectively.
    —    Security aspects like digital image sequence electronic signature, Presentation Attack Detection (PAD) and morphing prevention.
