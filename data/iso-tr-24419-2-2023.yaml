  content: This document is a supplementary document to the International standard
    for managing mining legacies (ISO 24419-1) that provides illustrative case studies
    and resources providing further reading. The content provided in this document
    covers various regions of the world as a supplement to ISO 24419-1. The purpose
    is to provide insight into specific case studies that show how practitioners have
    addressed mining legacy challenges in practice. This document does not provide
    instructions for managing mining legacies, but instead a resource with insights
    from other practitioners, thereby widening knowledge of what can be required to
    effectively manage mining legacies.
