abstract:
- content: This document is a supplementary document to the International standard
    for managing mining legacies (ISO 24419-1) that provides illustrative case studies
    and resources providing further reading. The content provided in this document
    covers various regions of the world as a supplement to ISO 24419-1. The purpose
    is to provide insight into specific case studies that show how practitioners have
    addressed mining legacy challenges in practice. This document does not provide
