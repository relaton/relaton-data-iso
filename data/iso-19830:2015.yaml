abstract:
- content: ISO 19830:2015 Standard is to define how peak fitting and the results of
    peak fitting in X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy shall be reported. It is applicable
    to the fitting of a single spectrum or to a set of related spectra, as might be
    acquired, for example, during a depth profile measurement. This International
    Standard provides a list of those parameters which shall be reported if either
    reproducible peak fitting is to be achieved or a number of spectra are to be fitted
    and the fitted spectra compared. This International Standard does not provide
    instructions for peak fitting nor the procedures which should be adopted.
