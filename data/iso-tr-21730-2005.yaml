  content: 'ISO 21730:2005 provides guidance for the deployment, use and management
    of mobile wireless communication and computing equipment in the healthcare facility
    in a way that helps mitigate potential hazards due to electromagnetic interference
    (EMI) with medical devices. The recommendations recognize the different resources,
    needs, concerns and environments of healthcare organizations around the world
    and provide detailed management guidelines for healthcare organizations that desire
    full deployment of mobile wireless communication and computing technology throughout
    their facility, as well as selective restrictions for healthcare organizations
    that have decided comprehensive management procedures are not feasible, practical,
    or desirable at the present time. The recommendations also distinguish between
    controlled systems used by doctors and staff for healthcare-specific communication
    and health informatics transport vs. non-controlled (personal) mobile wireless
    equipment randomly brought into the facility by visitors, patients and the healthcare
    organization workforce. '
