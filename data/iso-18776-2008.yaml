    ISO 18776:2008 specifies the requirements for Laminated Veneer Lumber (LVL) for general purposes and structural applications, in dry, tropical-dry/humid or high humidity/exterior conditions. Laminated Veneer Lumber (LVL) is a general description for an assembly of veneers laminated with an adhesive, in which the grain direction of the outer veneers and most other veneers is in the longitudinal direction.
    ISO 18776:2008 specifies requirements for the quality of veneers, bond durability, tolerances on dimensions, and structural characterization.
