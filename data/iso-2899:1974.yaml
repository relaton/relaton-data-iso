abstract:
- content: Applicable to products having contents of more than 0.0001 % (m/m). The
    procedure described is suitable for contents between 0.0001 % (m/m) and 0.0005
    % (m/m). It bases on distillation, with entrainment by steam, of the ammonia in
    the presence of an excess of sodium hydroxide and collection of the distillate
    in an excess of acid solution. Neutralization of the dexcess of acid and formation
    of the coloured complex by treatment with sodium phenate and sodium hypochlorite
    in the presence of acetone. Spectrophotometric measurement of the indophenol obtained
    at a wavelength of about 630 nm. Has also been approved by the IUPAC.
