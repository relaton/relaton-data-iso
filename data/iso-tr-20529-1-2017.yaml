- content: |-
    ISO/TR 20529-1:2017 provides the framework guideline for identifying cost-effective technologies and related standards required to deploy, manage and operate sustainable "green" intelligent transport systems (ITS) technologies in surface transportations with eco-mobility. These ITS technologies can increase operational efficiencies and unlock enhanced transportation safety and eco-mobility applications.
    The green ITS standard framework builds on the existing standards and best practices of transport operation and management systems, as well as ITS applications, and aims to accommodate to the specific needs of eco-mobility in either mega cities or developing countries.
    The G-ITS standards would expect to focus on the use of data exchange interface standards to enable the deployment of cloud-based multi-modal mobility solutions using wireless networks and nomadic devices. These forward-looking solutions are "infrastructure light" and thus can impact developing regions with little or no legacy transportation infrastructure.
    The framework described in ISO/TR 20529-1:2017 includes:
    -      G-ITS standard common framework including gap analysis of existing ITS standards;
    -      Guidance documents to facilitate the practical implementation of identified standards by policy makers and engineers including related use cases.
    ISO/TR 20529-1:2017 includes the identification of existing International Standards for ITS in ISO/TC 204 and existing vehicle communication network access standards.
