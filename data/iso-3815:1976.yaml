  content: Specifies the objective criteria which make it possible to assess the value
    of the results obtained in each particular case. It is not intended to prescribe
    a type of apparatus or a procedure for converting the instrument response to concentrations
    units because of the broad range of equipment available and the difficulty of
    completely specifying all working conditions in a spectrographic installation.
    The spectrographic analysis shall be carried out on solid metallic samples that
    should refer to standard samples.
