    ISO/IEC 24755:2007 defines a consistent set of screen icons and symbols, together with their related functions, that are presented by personal mobile communications devices (e.g. mobile phones and personal digital assistants). These devices have touch screens accessible by stylus pen, finger or button with personalized application.
    ISO/IEC 24755:2007 provides a consistent set of icon graphics for controlling these devices and for using personal information management-related applications. These icons and symbols represent typical functions and statuses by their association with conventional controls and functions on real-world objects.
    ISO/IEC 24755:2007 applies to all icon graphics displayed with a resolution of 32 x 32 pixels or higher. The graphic presentation can be either dynamic or fixed.
