- content: |-
    ISO 10295-2:2009 specifies the heating conditions, methods of test and criteria for the evaluation of the ability of a linear joint seal to maintain the fire integrity and thermal insulation of a fire-separating element at the joint being sealed. The purpose of the tests is to assess the integrity and insulation performance of the linear joint seals, including the effects of induced movement in those cases where the joint is designed to accommodate movement and has a width greater than 20 mm.
    It is not the intention of this part of ISO 10295-2:2009 to provide quantitative information on the rate of leakage of smoke and/or gases, or on the transmission or generation of fumes, although such phenomena can be recorded in describing the general behaviour of specimens during the test. It is not the intention of this part of ISO 10295-2:2009 to evaluate joint seals where special test procedures already exist, e.g. doors, partitions, penetrations, pipes, ducts and cables.
