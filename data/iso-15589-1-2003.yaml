  content: "ISO 15589-1:2003 specifies requirements and gives recommendations for
    the pre-installation surveys, design, materials, equipment, fabrication, installation,
    commissioning, operation, inspection and maintenance of cathodic protection systems
    for on-land pipelines, as defined in ISO 13623, for the petroleum and natural
    gas industries.\nISO 15589-1:2003 is applicable to buried carbon steel and stainless
    steel pipelines on land. It can also apply to landfalls of offshore pipeline sections
    protected by onshore-based cathodic protection installations.\nISO 15589-1:2003
    is also applicable to retrofits, modifications and repairs made to existing pipeline
    systems.\nNOTE Special conditions sometimes exist where cathodic protection is
    ineffective or only partially effective. Such conditions can include elevated
    temperatures, disbonded coatings, thermal insulating coatings, shielding, bacterial
    attack and unusual contaminants in the electrolyte. "
