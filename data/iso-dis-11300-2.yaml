abstract:
- content: "This document specifies requirements and test methods for pipes and fittings
    which are part of piping systems for the rehabilitation of underground non-pressure
    and pressure drainage and sewerage networks, and of water supply networks which
    transport water intended for human consumption, including raw water intake pipelines.
    \n\nIt is applicable to the renovation technique family:\n—\tlining with cured-in-place
    pipes (CIPP).\n\nIt applies to the use of thermoset composite materials with various
    thermosetting resin systems, in combination with compatible fibrous carrier materials,
    reinforcement, and other process-related plastics components (see 5.1).\n\nIt
    is applicable to pipes and fittings, as manufactured, as well as to the installed
    system, with service temperatures up to 50 °C for drainage and sewerage networks
    and up to 25°C for water supply networks.\n\nFor pressurised networks, this document
    applies to independent (fully structural, class A) and interactive (semi structural,
    class B) pressure pipe liners, as defined in ISO 11295, which do not rely on adhesion
    to the existing pipeline.\n\nIt does not include requirements or test methods
    for resistance to abrasion, cyclic loading or impact, which are outside the scope
    of this document."
