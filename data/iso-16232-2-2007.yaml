  content: |-
    ISO 16232-2:2007 describes the principles of extraction of contaminants from a component by the agitation method. It is preferably applied to components that are hollow and are suited to being agitated by an operator or by an appropriate mechanical device.
    This agitation method can be employed on its own or in association with other methods of extraction described in the ISO 16232 series.
    Unless otherwise specified, ISO 16232-2:2007 deals with particulate contamination only. It does not, therefore, cover appearance defects or contamination by liquid or gaseous materials. It covers the amount and the nature of residual particles resulting from manufacturing processes and from the environment.
