abstract:
- content: "This document provides appraisal framework to create and use urban management
    information derived from statistics, objectives, indicators and long-term goals
    for sustainable development of cities and communities. This document enables numerous
    combinations of data sources and data processing methods, making it easier to
    create and maintain urban management information and get ready for value mining
    of the big data of cities and communities.\nThe methodology is presented as a
    conceptual framework that allows implementation in a variety of ways. This can
    include the use of spreadsheets and databases on both a desktop and an online
    basis. This document aids the communication among various stakeholders such as
    top management, data enablers, data architects, property owners, facilities management
    (including asset management), statistics bodies, and so on. The methodology is
    also technologically agnostic, allowing organizations to adopt different technical
    solutions to generate and use data in line with specific UN SDGs, sustainability
    purposes and issues, objectives, or indicators. \nThis document includes data-specific
    guidance to implement the overarching strategy elaborated by ISO 37106 as being
    citizen-centric, digital and open and collaborative. This document does not include
    statistics or guidance on how to use the ISO 37120 series.\nAlthough not an AI
    subject standard, this document will be AI-compatible to facilitate cities and
    communities to get ready for the future application of Artificial Intelligence
    (AI) within the digital development topics relevant to sustainable cities and
    communities, including the use of AI techniques to process and analyse data collected
    from various owners, and to identify and solve problems that cities and communities
    face, to aid decision-making and achieve the sustainability purposes (as listed
    by ISO 37101) and UN Sustainable Development Goals in long term."
