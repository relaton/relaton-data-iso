    This document specifies the framework for an Additive Manufacturing Service Platform (AMSP). The following elements are within the scope of this document:
    —    Overview introducing the stakeholders and workflow of an AMSP.
    —    Requirements specifying various prerequisite conditions from different aspects.
    —    Framework defining a general functional architecture based on the identified requirements.
    —    Use cases showing typical work modes of an AMSP.
    This document is applicable when individuals or organizations (e.g. commercial enterprises, government agencies and non-profit organizations) build an AMSP or improve existing ones to provide 3D printing and other services specific to the submission, design and creation of AM parts.
