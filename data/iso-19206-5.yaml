abstract:
- content: "This document specifies performance requirements for surrogate targets
    used to assess the system detection and activation performance of active safety
    systems.\n\nThis document specifies the properties of an omni-directional multi-purpose
    Powered Two-Wheeler (PTW) target for assessment of interaction in a variety of
    traffic scenarios. \n\nThis document specifies the properties of a PTW target
    (PTWT) representing a Powered Two-Wheeler in terms of size, shape, reflection
    properties, etc. for testing purposes. This document addresses the detection requirements
    for a PTWT in terms of sensing technologies commonly in use at the time of publication
    of this document, and where possible, anticipated future sensing technologies.
    It also addresses methodologies to verify the target response properties to these
    sensors, as well as performance requirements for the target carrier.\n\nThe PTWTs
    specified in this document reflect two-wheeled vehicles corresponding to UN Category
    L3 and to UN Category L1, with the restrictions that the vehicle is not intended
    for human propulsion (for example pedalling) and its two wheels are inline.\n\nTwo
    types of PTWT are specified in this document; one corresponding to a motorcycle
    and one corresponding to a scooter/moped.\n\nThis document also addresses requirements
    for motion and positioning during test for PTWT including target carrier system.\n\nThis
    document does not address the test procedures in terms of speeds, positions, or
    timing of events. Performance criteria for the active safety system are also not
    addressed."
