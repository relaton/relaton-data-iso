- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: ISO/TR 13115:2011 describes the method of three-transducer calibration
    for calibrating frequency responses of absolute sensitivity by means of a reciprocity
    technique using three reversible acoustic emission transducers of the same kind,
    the method of two-transducer calibration for calibrating frequency responses of
    reception sensitivity of an optional acoustic emission transducer by using one
    acoustic emission transducer, the transmission responses of which have been calibrated
    by three-transducer calibration, the method for impulse response calibration for
    calibrating impulse responses of absolute sensitivity through inverse Fourier
    transform of the frequency responses measured by the three-transducer calibration,
    and the method for representing the calibration results.
