  content: 'The best scale will be determined by taking into consideration, in particular,
    the two following contradictory tendencies: a scale with too wide steps involves
    a waste of materials and an increase in the cost of manufacture, whereas a too
    closely spaced scale leads to an increase in the cost of tooling and also in the
    value of stock inventories. In selecting a scale of numerical values, choose that
    series having the highest ratio consistent with the desiderata to be satisfied,
    in the order: R 5, R 10, etc.'
