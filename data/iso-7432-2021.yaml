    This document specifies methods of test for joints with a locked socket and spigot, including double-socket joints, and with elastomeric seals, for buried and above-ground glass-reinforced thermosetting plastics (GRP) piping systems.
    It covers methods of testing for leaktightness and resistance to damage of the joint only, when subjected to specified combinations of angular movement, compression (deformation) perpendicular to the pipe axis and internal pressure. It assumes that the joint will be exposed to the effects of hydrostatic end thrust.
    The tests detailed in 9.2, 9.3, 9.4 and 9.6 are applicable to joints with a locked socket and spigot, including double-socket joints, and with elastomeric seals intended to be used in buried or above-ground applications.
    The bending tests detailed in 9.5 can be used to prove the design where joints are either intended to be used in buried applications or are intended to be used in particular above-ground situations, where the tests can be considered appropriate.
    With the exception of the procedure detailed in 9.5, these test procedures are applicable to joints for pipes and fittings of all nominal sizes. The tests detailed in 9.5 are applicable to joints for pipes and fittings up to and including DN 600. The tests are applicable for evaluating joints intended for applications conveying liquids at temperatures specified in the referring standards.
    The test procedures in this document are damaging to the test piece, which will not be suitable for reuse after these tests. The test procedure is intended for type testing purposes.
    This document is applicable only to the joint and specifies methods of testing to prove its design.
