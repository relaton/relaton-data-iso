- content: |-
    ISO/IEC 19500-3:2012 defines
    - the syntax and semantics of a component model, based on CORBA IDL, and a corresponding meta-model,
    - a language to describe the structure and state of component implementations, and a corresponding meta-model,
    - a programming model for constructing component implementations,
    - a runtime environment for component implementations,
    - interaction between components and Enterprise Java Beans,
    - meta-data for describing component-based applications, and interfaces for their deployment, and
    - a lightweight subset of the component model, programming model and runtime environment.
