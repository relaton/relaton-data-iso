    This document provides ergonomics data for standard developers to use in applying ISO/IEC Guide 71:2014 to address accessibility in standards. These data can also be used by ergonomists and designers to support the development of more accessible products, systems, services, environments, and facilities.
    The ergonomics data include quantitative data and knowledge about basic human characteristics and capabilities as well as context-specific and task-specific data, all being based on ergonomics research. The data focused on the effects of ageing and/or consequences of various types of human sensory, physical, and cognitive disabilities. It does not contain general ergonomics data that have no direct relation to ageing or disabilities.
    The data presented in this document are not exhaustive due to no available data for some aspects of human characteristics and capabilities with regard to ageing and disabilities.
