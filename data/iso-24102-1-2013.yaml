    ISO 24102-1:2013 provides specifications for intelligent transport systems (ITS) station management to be compliant with the ITS station reference architecture and the set of communications access for land mobiles (CALM) related standards.
    Local ITS station management protocols are specified by means of management messages and data that flow between the ITS station management entity and the security entity,       the application entity, and the various communication protocol layers of the ITS station reference architecture specified in ISO 21217.
