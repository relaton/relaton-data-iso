- content: |-
    This document provides guidance for performance testing of biometrics when this technology is used on mobile devices with local biometric authentication to improve authentication assurance.
    This document aims to:
    —     Provide guidance for affordable and cost-efficient testing and reporting methods for performance assessment at a full system level of biometric systems embedded in mobile devices with offline evaluation of false accept rate (FAR) claims.
    —     Define modality-specific considerations of these methods.
    This document is applicable to:
    —     verification use cases related to secure transactions.
    This document is not applicable to:
    —     privacy aspects;
    —     secure authentication from mobile device to server;
    —     testing and reporting for presentation attack detection (PAD) mechanisms in mobile devices;
    —     performance testing of biometric sub-systems such as acquisition sub-system or comparison sub-system;
    —     continuous authentication.
