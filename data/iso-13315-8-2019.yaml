    This document provides a general principle, procedures and requirements for environmental labels and declarations for concrete and concrete structures. It is used for the environmental labels and declarations for concrete constituents, reinforcement, concrete, concrete products and concrete structures.
    NOTE       This document contains more specific requirements for environmental labels and declarations for concrete and concrete structures, based on ISO 14020, ISO 14024, ISO 14025 and ISO 21930.
    This document includes the following phases of concrete and concrete structures:
    —          production phase of concrete constituents, concrete and concrete products;
    —          execution phase of concrete structures;
    —          use phase of concrete structures; and
    —          end-of-life phase.
    This document applies to the partial life cycle (certain phases of the life cycle) or the entire life cycle of concrete and concrete structures. It applies to new concrete and concrete structures as well as to existing concrete and concrete structures.
