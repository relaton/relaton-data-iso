    ISO 6042:2015 specifies the main dimensions, materials, quality and conditions of manufacture for weathertight single-leaf steel doors for application on board ships, in order to ensure interchangeability of the steel doors. The remaining dimensions, welding, and other details are left to the manufacturer.
    These doors generally conform to the requirements of the International Convention on Load Lines 1966 (ICLL66). The possibility for application of the doors to position 1 and position 2 has to be considered for each situation and, where necessary, the doors shall be provided with additional stiffening (see also Table 1).
    Users of this ISO 6042:2015 should note that while observing the requirements of this International Standard they should, at the same time, ensure compliance with such statutory requirements, rules, and regulations as may be applicable to the individual ship concerned.
