    This document specifies requirements for the design, fabrication, inspection and testing of static vacuum-insulated cryogenic vessels designed for a maximum allowable pressure of more than 0,5 bar.
    This document applies to static vacuum-insulated cryogenic vessels for fluids and does not apply to vessels designed for toxic fluids.
    This document also gives guidance for static vacuum-insulated cryogenic vessels designed for a maximum allowable pressure of not more than 0,5 bar.
