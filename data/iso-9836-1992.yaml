  content: In defining area measurement, uses the intra-muros and extra-muros concept.
    The indicators defined are intended for practical use, as a basis for measuring
    various aspects of the performance of buildings or as a planning aid. Intended
    to be used when establishing 1) specifications for the geometric performance of
    a building and its spaces, 2) technical documentation relating to the performance
    of whole buildings, 3) evaluation, comparison or control of the properties of
    a building which are connected to its geometric performance.
