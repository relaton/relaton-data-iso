  content: Gives the potentiometric and visual methods als alternatives for the final
    titration. The principle consists in the combustion of the sulphur in a current
    of oxygen. Oxidation and fixation of the sulphur dioxide and trioxide gases in
    chromic and sulphuric acid solutions. Absorption of the carbon dioxide formed
    in a solution of barium hydroxide, followed by titration in the presence of phenolphthalein
    and screened methylorange (by xylene cyanol FF) as indicator. Has also been approved
    by the IUPAC.
