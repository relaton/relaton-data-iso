    ISO 22968:2010 specifies the terminology, test procedures and general requirements for the construction and operation of automatic forced draught oil burners supplied with a fuel having a viscosity at the burner inlet of 1,6 mm2/s (cSt) to 6 mm2/s (cSt) at 20 °C or higher, boiling petroleum in accordance with ISO 8217-based first raffinates, and the provision of related control and safety devices.
    It is applicable to automatic oil burners fitted with a combustion air fan, equipped as described therein, and intended for use in appliances of different types and operated with fuel oils, single burners with a single combustion chamber, single‑fuel and dual‑fuel burners when operating only on oil, and the oil function of dual-fuel burners designed for simultaneous operation on gaseous and liquid fuels (for the former operation, see also ISO 22967).
    It is not applicable to burners used in direct fired processes either with defined combustion chamber applications or where the combustion chamber wall surface temperature is greater than 750 °C or the heat transfer medium temperature is greater than 500 °C.
