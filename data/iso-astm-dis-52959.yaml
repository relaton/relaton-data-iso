    This document defines testing coupons and methods for the evaluation of the compression strength of AM lattice designs. The standardized test coupons will accommodate the application of a variety of lattice designs, while standardizing the evaluation method.
    This document is generally intended to be used in validation or verification activities for an additively manufactured component that incorporates a lattice or porous (non-solid) design.
    Details may include limits or requirements for minimum repeated elements and relative dimensions of the specimen.
    Note: Due to inherent variability across the manufacturing of AM components, evaluation methods are needed. Specifically, when an eventual component is intended to be subjected to compressive loads, a representative testing coupon is needed to represent the component to undergo destructive evaluation as a surrogate for the component itself.
