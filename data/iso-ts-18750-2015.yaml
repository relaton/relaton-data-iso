    This Technical Specification
    —    describes the functionality of a “Local Dynamic Map” (LDM) in the context of the “Bounded Secured Managed Domain” (BSMD), and
    —    specifies
    —    general characteristics of LDM Data Objects (LDM-DOs) that may be stored in an LDM, i.e. information on real objects such as vehicles, road works sections, slow traffic sections, special weather condition sections, etc. which are as a minimum requirement location-referenced and time-referenced,
    —    service access point functions providing interfaces in an ITS station (ITS-S) to access an LDM for
    —    secure add, update, and delete access for ITS-S application processes,
    —    secure read access (query) for ITS-S application processes,
    —    secure notifications (upon subscription) to ITS-S application processes, and
    —    management access,
    —    secure registration, de-registration, and revocation of ITS-S application processes at LDM, and
    —    secure subscription and cancellation of subscriptions of ITS-S application processes,
    —    procedures in an LDM considering
    —    means to maintain the content and integrity of the data store, and
    —    mechanisms supporting several LDMs in a single ITS station unit.
