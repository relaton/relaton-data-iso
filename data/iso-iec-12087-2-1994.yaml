abstract:
- content: Establishes the specification of the application program interface (API),
    called the Programmer's Imaging Kernel System (PIKS). PIKS is intended to provide
    a rich set of both low-level and high-level services on image and image-derived
    data objects. These services can be used as building blocks for a broad range
    of common imaging applications. Lists are included containing a summary of technological
    capabilities provided by PIKS and not provided by PIKS. It should be noted that
    PIKS functionality may be useful as a pre-processor or co-processor for many of
    the technologies in the "Not provided by PIKS" list.
