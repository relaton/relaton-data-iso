abstract:
- content: |-
    This document gives guidance for the safe use of high-performance fibre ropes (HPFR) in crane applications.
    This document also covers winch applications. The mention of crane applications implicitly includes winch applications.
    This document covers performance criteria and the necessary evaluation to enable selection of HPFR as well as best practice guidelines on procedures, testing and maintenance to safely operate HPFR in crane applications including provisions for assembly/disassembly.
    The performance criteria are related to tasks performed when using cranes as intended, including assembly/disassembly, operation and required checks and maintenance.
    This document does not deal with so-called hybrid ropes which are a combination of steel wire and high-performance fibres, where the load bearing capability is shared between steel wires and the high-performance fibre. This document does not deal with HPFR used for high risk applications (e.g. transport of hot molten metal).
