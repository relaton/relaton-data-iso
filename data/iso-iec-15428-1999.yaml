    This International Standard specifies the Wireless Terminal Location Registration supplementary service (SS-WTLR) and the
    Wireless Terminal Information Exchange additional network feature (ANF-WTINFO), which are applicable to various basic
    services supported by Private Integrated Services Networks (PISN). Basic services are specified in ISO/IEC 11574.
    The Wireless Terminal Location Registration Supplementary Service (SS-WTLR) enables a WTM user to register at, or
    de-register from, the current location within the PISN. The ability to register at different locations in the PISN at different times
    enables the WTM user to maintain the provided services (including the ability to make and receive calls) at different access
    points. De-registration is used to inform the PISN that the WTM user is temporarily unable to make use of the provided
    services (including the receipt of incoming calls).
    The Information Exchange Additional Network Feature (ANF-WTINFO) allows to exchange information about a WTLR user
    between the Home Data Base and the Visitor Data Base.
    Supplementary service and additional network feature specifications are produced in three stages, according to the method
    described in CCITT Recommendation I.130. This International Standard contains the stage 1 and stage 2 specifications of
    SS-WTLR and ANF-WTINFO. The stage 1 specification (clause 6 and 7) specifies the service/feature as seen by users of
    PISNs. The stage 2 specification (clause 8 and 9) identifies the functional entities involved in the service/feature and the
    information flows between them.
