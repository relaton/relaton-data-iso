  content: This standard is valid for all types of implantable pacemakers and specifies
    as well the basic terms and definitions as the requirements for designation and
    packaging of pacemakers. In connection with the corresponding test methods minimum
    requirements are given for the ability of a pacemaker generator to resist adverse
    environmental conditions. The annexes A to F contain a code system for identification
    of the mode of operation, test methods, evaluation of livetime, certain forms
    and the symbols that can be be used instead of written words.
