  content: "Water shortages are one of the most crucial treats to sustainable development
    of society. Reclaimed water is considered as a safe, reliable and sustainable
    water source to satisfy water demands in many water-scarce areas. \n\nThis International
    Standard is intended to standardize the benefit evaluation of reclaimed water
    use, guiding the progress of planning, designing, operating, management and evaluation
    of water reuse benefits.  \n\nThis International Standard is applicable to practitioners
    and regulatory authorities who propose to implement principles and guidelines
    on evaluation of reclaimed water use benefit, which aims to achieve a reasonable
    and comprehensive evaluation of reclaimed water use, identify the key benefits
    of reclaimed water use at local and regional levels, further expand water reuse
    market and improve water reuse efficiency. \n\nThis International Standard presents:\n-
    Standard terms and definitions;\n- Evaluation indicators of reclaimed water use
    benefit, including resource benefit index, environmental benefit index, social
    benefit index, economic benefit index, etc;\n- Procedures of benefit evaluation
    of reclaimed water use;\n- Evaluation indexes with respect to different aspects
    of reclaimed water use benefit."
