    ISO 7396-1 specifies requirements for design, installation, function, performance, documentation, testing and commissioning of compressed medical gas and vacuum pipeline systems in health care facilities to ensure continuous delivery of the correct gas from the pipeline system. It includes requirements for supply systems, pipeline distribution systems, control systems, monitoring and alarm systems and non-interchangeability between components of different gas systems.
    ISO 7396-1 is applicable to pipeline systems for the following medical gases:
    - oxygen;
    - oxygen-enriched air;
    - nitrous oxide;
    - air for breathing;
    - carbon dioxide;
    - oxygen/nitrous oxide mixtures;
    - air for driving surgical tools;
    - nitrogen for driving surgical tools;
    and to vacuum pipeline systems.
    ISO 7396-1 is also applicable to pipeline distribution systems for oxygen-enriched air connected to supply systems with oxygen concentrators complying with ISO 10083.
    ISO 7396-1 also applies to extensions and modifications of existing pipeline systems.
    ISO 7396-1 is not applicable to provision for gas-specific connectors on mobile or stationary cryogenic vessels or on transport vehicles, or on the inlet/outlet of cylinders for non-cryogenic liquid or gas.
    ISO 7396-1 does not apply to medical gas pipeline systems supplying hyperbaric chambers.
