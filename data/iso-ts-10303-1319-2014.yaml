    solid models with variable radius edge blends;\n- solid models with chamfers;\n-
    solid models modified by the creation of positioned and oriented local shape configurations
    (`features');\n- surfaces, faces and connected assemblies of faces;\n- solid models
    modified by the application of operations to their faces;\n- solid models modified
    by the removal of material from one side of an intersecting generalised surface;\n-
    solid models modified by adding material to, or subtracting material from, existing
