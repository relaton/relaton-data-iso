    1.1 This International Standard specifies dark storage conditions, storage facilities, and handling and inspecting
    procedures for processed photographic plates having integral photographic layers and intended for record
    purposes.
    1.2 This International Standard is applicable to black-and-white, silver-image, gelatin, processed photographic
    plates as defined in 3.7.7. It is also applicable to medium-term and extended-term storage conditions as defined in
    3.6 and 3.2, respectively.
    No specific distinction is made, other than the degree of care, between photographic plates for medium-term or
    extended-term storage. Recommendations for plate storage relate to materials, methods, conditions, and forms of
    protection applicable specifically to plates defined in 1.1. However, these storage recommendations may also be
    applied to lacquered and opaque plates, to black-and-white plates altered by dyes or toners, colour plates and
    other historic photographic plates defined in 3.7.2 to 3.7.8.
    1.3 It is not intended to predict or assign a useful lifetime to processed photographic plates stored in accordance
    with the specifications of this International Standard.
    1.4 Recommendations for storage of photographic films are given in ISO 18911 and for storage of processed
    photographic reflection print material in ISO 18920.
    Although there is some variation in recommended storage conditions among these types of photographic materials,
    recommended temperature and relative humidity ranges do overlap. If all three types of photographic materials are
    found in one collection or within one storage area, the temperature and relative humidity should be chosen so that
    all materials are stored within their recommended ranges.
