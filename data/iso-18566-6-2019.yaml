    This document establishes guidelines for the determination of input parameters for ceiling mounted radiant heating and cooling panels in relation to ISO 52031. The requirements specified by this document are applicable only to the components of the heating/cooling systems and the elements which are part of the heating/cooling panels and which are installed to provide heating and/or cooling.
    This document is applicable to water-based ceiling mounted radiant heating and cooling panels in residential, commercial and industrial buildings. The methods apply to systems mounted under the ceiling with an open air gap between the panels and the ceiling.
    This document also applies, as appropriate, to the use of fluids other than water as a heating or cooling medium. This document is also applicable for testing of systems. The methods do not apply to heated or chilled ceiling beams.
