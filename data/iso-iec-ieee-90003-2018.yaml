    This document provides guidance for organizations in the application of ISO 9001:2015 to the acquisition, supply, development, operation and maintenance of computer software and related support services. It does not add to or otherwise change the requirements of ISO 9001:2015.
    Annex A provides a table pointing to additional guidance on the implementation of ISO 9001:2015, available in ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 7, ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 27 and ISO/TC 176 International Standards.
    The guidelines provided in this document are not intended to be used as assessment criteria in quality management system registration/certification. However, some organizations can consider it useful to implement the guidelines proposed in this document and can be interested in knowing whether the resultant quality management system is compliant or not with this document. In this case, an organization can use both this document and ISO 9001 as assessment criteria for quality management systems in the software domain.
