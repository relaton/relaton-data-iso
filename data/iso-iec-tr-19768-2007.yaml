abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC TR 19768:2007 specifies a series of extensions to the standard
    library for the programming language C++, as specified by ISO/IEC 14882, in order
    to build more widespread existing practice for an expanded C++ standard library.
    Some of the components in ISO/IEC TR 19768:2007 could be considered for standardization
    in a future version of C++.\nThe specific classes of extensions specified in ISO/IEC
    TR 19768:2007 are as follows:\n- general utilities such as reference-counted pointers;\n-
    functional programming;\n- facilities for compile-time type queries;\n- enhanced
    support for numerical computation;\n- hash tables and other additional container
    classes;\n- regular expression processing; \n- improved capability with the programming
    language C, as specified by ISO/IEC 9899."
