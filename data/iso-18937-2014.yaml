    ISO 18937:2014 describes test equipment and procedures for measuring the light stability of images of colour photographic reflection prints designed for display in, for example, houses, apartments, other dwelling places, offices and commercial display, when subjected to certain illuminants at specified temperatures and relative humidities. It also addresses colour photographic reflection prints designed for display in galleries and museums.
    Indoor illumination conditions described in ISO 18937:2014 include a) simulated indoor daylight typical home display, b) simulated direct sunlight in-window display, c) fluorescent illumination using "cool white", and d) other types of illumination sources, such as other fluorescent lamps, tungsten halogen, LED, OLED and metal halide lamps.
    ISO 18937:2014 is applicable to reflection colour prints made with colour hardcopy materials. Included are inkjet prints, thermal dye diffusion transfer ("dye-sub") prints, liquid- and dry-toner electrophotographic prints, prints made with traditional chromogenic ("silver-halide") photographic colour materials and, in general, all types of colour prints made with direct analog and digital print processes. The recommended evaluation methods can also be applied to black-and-white photographic prints.
