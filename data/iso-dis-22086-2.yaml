abstract:
- content: "This standard specifies the functional requirements of a nomadic device
    for lane-level positioning and integrity monitoring with the Network based Precise
    Positioning Infrastructure for Land Transportation (NETPPI-LT), which is a lane-level
    positioning system based on Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) and is
    described in ISO 22086-1. Also, the data interface between the nomadic device
    and the control station, which is part of the NETPPI-LT providing GNSS correction
    and integrity information, is specified to enable the nomadic device to support
    lane-level positioning and integrity monitoring. Enabling techniques and methods,
    which can be different for each provider/vendor, remain as competitive parts and
    are not addressed in this standard.\n\nThe scope of this standard includes:\na)\tProviding
    functional requirements for a nomadic device to perform the lane-level positioning
    and integrity monitoring with the NETPPI-LT,\nb)\tDefining message sets to be
    received from and to be sent to the control station on the nomadic device for
    supporting the functionalities of the NETPPI-LT."
