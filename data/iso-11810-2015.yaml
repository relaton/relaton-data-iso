    ISO 11810:2015 is applicable to disposable and reusable, as well as woven and non-woven materials used as surgical drapes and other patient-protective covers which claim to be laser-resistant. The purpose of this International Standard is to provide a standardized method for testing and classifying surgical drapes and other patient-protective covers with respect to laser-induced hazards. An appropriate classification system is given. It is not the purpose of this International Standard to serve as a general fire safety specification, and as such, this International Standard does not cover other sources of ignition.
    All materials reflect portions of the beam and it is necessary for the user to decide whether specular reflectance can be a hazard. This measurement, however, is not covered in this International Standard.
    The test procedure can be used to assess the laser induced flammability properties of non-laser-resistant items
    NOTE          Users of products tested by this method are cautioned that the laser resistance of a surgical drape and/or patient-protective cover will be wavelength sensitive and that a surgical drape and/or patient-protective cover are better tested at the wavelength for which it is intended to be used. If tested using other wavelengths, it is necessary to explicitly state the power settings and modes of delivery.
