abstract:
- content: |-
    ISO/IEC 24727 specifies a set of programming interfaces and protocols enabling interactions between integrated circuit cards (ICCs) and applications resident on a variety of computer platforms. The ICCs provide generic services for multi-sector use by the applications. The organization and the operation of the ICCs conform to ISO/IEC 7816 4. It is anticipated that some application domains will seek to achieve interoperability through ISO/IEC 24727 facilities even though the applications pre-exist these facilities. To this end, various means of backward compatibility are established through mechanisms specified in ISO/IEC 24727.
    ISO/IEC 24727-1:2014 specifies
    - system architecture and principles of operation,
    - the means for achieving interoperability among diverse application domains,
    - the conceptual service and data models that span the relevant application domains, and
    - the rationale for trusted processes enabled under these models.
