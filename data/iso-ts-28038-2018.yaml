abstract:
- content: "1.1 This document is concerned with polynomial calibration functions that
    describe the relationship between a stimulus variable and a response variable.
    These functions contain parameters estimated from calibration data consisting
    of a set of pairs of stimulus value and response value. Various cases are considered
    relating to the nature of any uncertainties associated with the data. \n1.2 Estimates
    of the polynomial function parameters are determined using least‐squares methods,
    taking account of the specified uncertainty information. It is assumed that the
    calibration data are fit for purpose and thus the treatment of outliers is not
    considered. It is also assumed that the calibration data errors are regarded as
    drawn from normal distributions. An emphasis of this document is on choosing the
    least‐squares method appropriate for the nature of the data uncertainties in any
    particular case. Since these methods are well documented in the technical literature
    and software that implements them is freely available, they are not described
    in this document. \n1.3 Commonly occurring types of covariance matrix associated
    with the calibration data are considered covering (a) response data uncertainties,
    (b) response data uncertainties and covariances, (c) stimulus and response data
    uncertainties, and (d) stimulus data uncertainties and covariances, and response
    data uncertainties and covariances. The case where the data uncertainties are
    unknown is also treated.\n1.4 Methods for selecting the degree of the polynomial
    calibration function according to prescribed criteria are given. The covariance
    matrix associated with the estimates of the parameters in the selected polynomial
    function is available as a by‐product of the least‐squares methods used. \n1.5
    For the chosen polynomial function this document describes the use of the parameter
    estimates and their associated covariance matrix for inverse and direct evaluation.
    It also describes how the provisions of ISO/IEC Guide 98‐3:2008 (GUM) can be used
    to provide the associated standard uncertainties. \n1.6 Consideration is given
    to accounting for certain constraints (such as the polynomial passing through
    the origin) that may need to be imposed and also to the use of transformations
    of the variables that may render the behaviour of the calibration function more
    polynomial‐like. Interchanging the roles of the variables is also considered.
    \n1.7 Examples from several areas of measurement science illustrate the use of
    this document."
