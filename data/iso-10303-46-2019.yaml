abstract:
- content: "ISO 10303-46:2019\n         specifies the integrated resource constructs
    for \n         Visual presentation.\n         \n      \n\n         \tISO 10303-46
    specifies the integrated resources for the visualization of displayable product
    information. \n         \tPresentation data as described in ISO 10303-46 are combined
    with product data and are exchanged together between systems\n         with the
    aim that the receiving system can construct one or several pictures of the product
    information suitable for human\n         perception.\n         \t\n      \n\n
    \        \tProduct information can be visualized in two ways: either by realistic,
    life-like images according to the rules of projective\n         geometry and light
    propagation and reflection, or by symbolic presentations that conform with draughting
    standards and conventions.\n         \tISO 10303-46 supports both types of presentations.
    The two types of visualization processes require different kinds of graphical\n
    \        transformations and these can be combined in the same picture.\n         \t\n
    \     \nThe actual generation of the picture from the product information and
    its presentation data is left to the receiving system.\n         The rendered
    depiction can deviate from an ideal target because of limitations in the capabilities
    of graphics systems.\n         \t\n      "
