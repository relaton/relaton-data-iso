  content: A yellow complex is formed by reaction of the vanadium present in a test
    portion with phosphoric acid and sodium tungstate in acid medium. The spectrometric
    measurement of the absorbance is carried out at a wavelength of about 425 nm.
    The method is applicable to products having a vanadium content equal to or greater
    than 3 mg/kg.
