- content: |-
    ISO 16413:2013 specifies a method for the evaluation of thickness, density and interface width of single layer and multilayered thin films which have thicknesses between approximately 1 nm and 1 μm, on flat substrates, by means of X-Ray Reflectometry (XRR).
    This method uses a monochromatic, collimated beam, scanning either an angle or a scattering vector. Similar considerations apply to the case of a convergent beam with parallel data collection using a distributed detector or to scanning wavelength, but these methods are not described here. While mention is made of diffuse XRR, and the requirements for experiments are similar, this is not covered in the present document.
    Measurements may be made on equipment of various configurations, from laboratory instruments to reflectometers at synchrotron radiation beamlines or automated systems used in industry.
    Attention should be paid to an eventual instability of the layers over the duration of the data collection, which would cause a reduction in the accuracy of the measurement results. Since XRR, performed at a single wavelength, does not provide chemical information about the layers, attention should be paid to possible contamination or reactions at the specimen surface. The accuracy of results for the outmost layer is strongly influenced by any changes at the surface.
