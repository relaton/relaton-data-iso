  content: The hydroxyl group is esterified by acetic anhydride in pyridine solution.
    The excess of acetic anhydride is hydrolized with water. The acidity which appears
    during the esterification and the acetic acid formed during the hydrolysis are
    neutralized by sodium hydroxide solution in the presence of phenolphthalein as
    indicator. The hydroxyl value is calculated from the difference between the volume
    od sodium hydroxide solution used for the titration of the blank and of the test
    solution.
