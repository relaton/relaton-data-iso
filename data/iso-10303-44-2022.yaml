abstract:
- content: "ISO 10303-44 specifies the integrated resource constructs for Product
    structure configuration.\nThe following are within the scope of ISO 10303-44:\n-
    the relationships among the components and assemblies of products;\n- the relationships
    among products and their components as made by modification of other products;\nEXAMPLE 1  
    The machining of a product from another product is an example of a modification.
    \n\n- the description of a product as defined by customer needs;\n- the dependencies
    among specifications of a product in order to represent possible product variations
    to present to a customer;\n- the management of the structure for configuration
    of assemblies and components as planned for manufacture;\n- the decomposition
    of a product to support different product life cycle activities;\nEXAMPLE 2  
    An organization maintains one bill-of-material structure for a product that enumerates
    the quantity of each component used in each assembly, and a second bill-of-material
    that decomposes a product with multiple assemblies into the individual components.
    See annex Examples for more examples of different product structure reports that
    are supported. \n\n- multiple versions of a single product that are equivalent
    with respect to form, fit, and function."
