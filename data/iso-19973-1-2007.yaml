    ISO 19973-1:2007 provides general procedures, the calculation method for assessing the reliability of pneumatic fluid power components and the methods of reporting. These procedures are independent of the kinds of components and of their design.
    ISO 19973-1:2007 also provides general test conditions and a method for data evaluation.
    Because the service life of any component is subject to accidental variations, a statistical evaluation assists the interpretation of the test results. The methods specified in ISO 19973-1:2007 apply to the first failure without repairs, but exclude outliers; however, because outliers can be highly significant, information about how to deal with them is given.
