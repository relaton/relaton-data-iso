    ISO 20805:2011 applies to continuous hot-rolled steel sheet of higher yield strength with improved formability. The steel is killed, made according to a fine-grain practice and has a suitable chemical composition, which includes microalloying elements, to provide improved formability. The steel can be treated to achieve inclusion control. The product is intended for applications where parts are to be fabricated requiring better formability than is provided by normal high-yield-strength steel sheet. It is generally used in the as-delivered condition. This product is commonly produced on a wide strip mill.
    Because of the combination of higher strength and improved formability, it is possible to obtain savings in mass along with better weldability.
    This product is commonly produced in the range of thicknesses greater than 6 mm to 25 mm, and widths of 600 mm and over, in coils. Hot-rolled sheet less than 600 mm wide can be slit from wide sheet and will be considered as sheet.
    ISO 20805:2011 does not cover steels intended for boilers or pressure vessels, or steels designated as commercial quality, drawing quality or structural quality, or steels rolled to cold-reduced products, or steels designated as weathering steels, having increased atmospheric corrosion resistance, or those products rolled on a plate mill.
