abstract:
- content: |-
    ISO 17427-2:2015 characterizes and provides an overview of the framework which enables collaborative and cooperative ITS to operate and defines the characteristics and components of a Cooperative-ITS (C-ITS), its context and relevance for ITS service provision, and provides references to International Standards deliverables where specific aspects of C-ITS are defined. The objective of this Technical Report is to raise awareness of and consideration of such issues and to give pointers, where appropriate, to International Standards deliverables existing that provide for all or some of these aspects. This Technical Report does not provide specifications for solutions of these issues.
    ISO 17427-2:2015 is agnostic in respect of technology and operates with whatever communications and hardware technologies can support its functionalities.
    NOTE          Other deliverables in this family of C-ITS standards will define specific aspects of technology and behaviour and the roles and responsibilities within the context of C-ITS.
