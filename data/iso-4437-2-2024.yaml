    This document specifies the characteristics of pipes made from polyethylene (PE) for piping systems in the field of the supply of gaseous fuels.
    It also specifies the test parameters for the test methods referred to in this document.
    In conjunction with ISO 4437-1, ISO 4437-3, ISO 4437-4 and ISO 4437-5, this document is applicable to PE pipes, fittings and valves, their joints, and joints with components of PE and other materials intended to be used under the following conditions:
    a)       a maximum operating pressure (MOP), up to and including 10 bar[1], at a reference temperature of 20 °C for design purposes;
    b)       an operating temperature between −20 °C and 40 °C.
    For operating temperatures between 20 °C and 40 °C, derating coefficients are defined in ISO 4437-5.
    The ISO 4437 series covers a range of MOPs and gives requirements concerning colours.
    This document is applicable to three types of pipes:
    —     PE pipes (outside diameter, dn) including any identification stripes;
    —     PE pipes with co-extruded layers on either or both the outside and/or inside of the pipe (total outside diameter, dn) as specified in Annex A, where all PE layers have the same MRS rating;
    —     PE pipes (outside diameter, dn) with a peelable and contiguous thermoplastics additional layer on the outside of the pipe ("coated pipe") as specified in Annex B.
    It is the responsibility of the purchaser or specifier to make the appropriate selections from these aspects, taking into account their particular requirements and any relevant national regulations and installation practices or codes.
