    This document specifies requirements for the integration of numerical control systems (NC systems). It consists of technical and inspection requirements and test methods.
    This document is applicable to all machine tools using NC systems not already covered by class C standards (including metal cutting machine tools, metal forming machine tools and woodworking machine tools) and for partial assemblies of machine tools (including cabinets and auxiliary devices) intended to be integrated into machine tools. It is also applicable to other production equipment using NC systems.
    NOTE      NC system integration with machine tools is performed mainly by machine tool builders using an NC system to control their machine tools, system integrators by assembling machine tools with the NC system to a production line, and machine tool users by upgrading their existing equipment.
