abstract:
- content: "ISO/ASTM 51702:2013 outlines the installation qualification program for
    an irradiator and the dosimetric procedures to be followed during operational
    qualification, performance qualification, and routine processing in facilities
    that process products with ionizing radiation from radionuclide gamma sources
    to ensure that product has been treated within a predetermined range of absorbed
    dose. Other procedures related to operational qualification, performance qualification,
    and routine processing that may influence absorbed dose in the product are also
    discussed.\nNOTE 1 \x97 Dosimetry is only one component of a total quality assurance
    program for adherence to good manufacturing practices used in radiation processing
    applications.\nNOTE 2 \x97 ISO/ASTM Practices 51818 and 51649 describe dosimetric
    procedures for low and high enery electron beam facilities for radiation processing
    and ISO/ASTM Practice 51608 describes procedures for X-ray (bremsstrahlung) facilities
    for radiation processing."
