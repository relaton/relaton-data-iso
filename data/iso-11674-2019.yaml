    This document specifies the minimum operational, functional and performance requirements, as well as methods of testing and the corresponding required test results, for heading control systems installed on board ships conforming to performance standards adopted by IMO Resolution MSC.64(67), Annex 3.
    In addition, it takes into account parts of IMO resolution A.694(17) to which IEC 60945 is associated.
    Also it takes into account IMO resolution MSC.302(87) on bridge alert management (BAM).
    In this document, the ship models of simulators used for performance testing are based on those from ships with a combined system of propeller propulsion and conventional rudder, with a speed range of up to 30 knots.
    The test results are considered also to be valid for ships with multiple parallel operated rudders.
    NOTE    The text in this document that is identical to that in IMO Resolution A.342(IX), as amended by IMO Resolution MSC.64(67) Annex 3, and IMO Resolution A.694(17), is printed in italics.
