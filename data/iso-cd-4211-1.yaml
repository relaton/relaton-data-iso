    to cold liquids of all rigid furniture surfaces regardless of materials. \nIt
    does not apply to leather and textile surfaces.\nThe test is intended to be carried

    of the same material, finished in an identical manner to the finished product,
    and of a size sufficient to meet the requirements of the test.\nThe type and number
    of test liquids (Annex A) and the test periods (Table 1) shall be stated in requirement
    specifications or shall be agreed upon between purchaser and supplier or interested
    parties.\nAnnex A (normative) includes a selection of suitable test liquids. Other
