  content: The method specified determines only those phenols capable of reacting
    at the 2nd, 4th and 6th position (-OH = 1). The procedure consists in extraction
    of free phenols from a test portion with sodium hydroxide solution. Bromination
    of these phenols with potassium bromide-bromate solution in an acid medium and
    determination of the excess bromine after reaction with potassium iodide by titration
    with standard volumetric sodium thiosulphate solution.
