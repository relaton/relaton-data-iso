    This International Standard provides an overview and guide for the selection and implementation by shipowners and
    operators of a fleet management system (FMS) network of computer services. This includes
    a) guidelines for the general infrastructure, including wide area network, data transmission services and common
    database facilities,
    b) guidelines for the shipboard installations, including services to application programs, and
    c) guidelines for land-based installations, including services to application programs.
    This International Standard does not purport to address the requirements for safety-related systems, e.g. navigation,
    radio communication as well as systems used to control the operation of the ship.
    This International Standard does not purport to address any of the environmental considerations associated with the
    use of the fleet management system.
