abstract:
- content: "1.1   Purpose  \nISO 21080:2016 defines a Recommended Standard for the
    CCSDS Licklider Transmission Protocol (LTP) and associated service for application
    in the space environment. LTP provides optional reliability mechanisms on top
    of an underlying (usually data link) communication service.\nLTP is intended for
    use over the current and envisaged packet delivery services used in the space
    environment, including:\n-      CCSDS conventional packet telecommand;\n-      CCSDS
    conventional packet telemetry.\nFor space data links, LTP will typically be deployed
    over a CCSDS data link that supports CCSDS Encapsulation Packets so that one LTP
    segment can be encapsulated in a single Encapsulation Packet. LTP may also operate
    over a wide variety of ground-network services including those specified by the
    CCSDS for cross-support purposes."
