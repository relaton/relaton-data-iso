- content: |-
    ISO 10109-1:2005 is applicable to optical instruments and instruments with optical components. It specifies the requirements to be met with regard to the reliability of the optical, mechanical, chemical and electrical properties or performance characteristics of the instruments when exposed to environmental influences. Hence it also determines geographical and technical areas of application. Environmental test methods, as specified in ISO 9022 (all parts), are assigned to the various areas of application for the purpose of ascertaining the suitability of the instruments in the respective area of application.
    ISO 10109-1:2005 does not deal with the requirements to be met by the packaging of the instruments during transport from the manufacturer to the user.
