    Part 4 of ISO/IEC 14143 defines the reference model (Figure 0.1) to be used when verifying a Functional Size
    Measurement (FSM) method.
    The reference model consists of two components:
    - a classification framework of Reference User Requirements (RUR) which can be sized using an FSM
    Method. Included are examples of such RUR as well as references to further publications of User
    Requirements (UR) which can be used for RUR, and
    - guidance on selecting Reference FSM Methods, against which an FSM Method can be compared.
    The reference model is an input to the evaluation process of an FSM Method. The formulation and execution of
    evaluation tests and the interpretation of their results is outside the scope of this Technical Report.
    The RUR and additional references contained in this Technical Report only represent examples of UR in some
    domains and situations. Additional RUR and RUR for domains and situations not covered by Annex A, B, or C may
    be generated with the assistance of the framework described in this Technical Report.
    The requirements for Reference FSM Methods may assist in selecting Reference FSM Methods.
