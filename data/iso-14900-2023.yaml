    This document specifies two methods for the measurement of the hydroxyl number of polyols used as polyurethane raw materials.
    The hydroxyl content of polyols are determined to properly formulate polyurethane systems. Method A is primarily applicable to readily esterified polyether polyols. It is also intended for polyols which have significant steric hindrance, such as those based on sugars. Method B is intended for polyether polyols, polymer polyols and amine-initiated polyols, but can give low results for sterically hindered polyols. Other polyols can be analysed by these methods if precautions are taken to verify applicability. These methods can be used for research and for quality control and specification purposes.
