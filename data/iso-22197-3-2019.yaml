abstract:
- content: "This document specifies a test method for the determination of the air-purification
    performance of materials that contain a photocatalyst or have photocatalytic films
    on the surface, usually made from semiconducting metal oxides, such as titanium
    dioxide or other ceramic materials, by continuous exposure of a test piece to
    the model air pollutant under irradiation with ultraviolet light (UV-A). \nThis
    document is intended for use with different kinds of materials, such as construction
    materials in flat sheet, board or plate shape, that are the basic forms of materials
    for various applications. \nThis document also applies to structured filter materials
    including honeycomb-form, woven and non-woven fabrics, and to plastic or paper
    materials if they contain ceramic microcrystals and composites. This document
    does not apply to powder or granular photocatalytic materials.\nThis test method
    is usually applicable to photocatalytic materials produced for air purification.
    This method is not suitable for the determination of other performance attributes
    of photocatalytic materials, i.e. decomposition of water contaminants, self-cleaning,
    antifogging and antibacterial actions. It concerns the removal of toluene."
