abstract:
- content: "ISO 22263:2008 specifies a framework for the organization of project information
    (process-related as well as product-related) in construction projects. Its purpose
    is to facilitate control, exchange, retrieval and use of relevant information
    about the project and the construction entity. It is intended for all agents in
    the project organization in management of the construction process as a whole
    and in coordination of its sub-processes and activities.\nThis framework consists
    of a number of generic parameters that are applicable to projects of varying complexity,
    size and duration and is adaptable to national, local and project-specific variations
    of the construction process. "
