  content: Specifies a method for the determination of the air content of freshly
    mixed concrete from observation of the change in volume of concrete with a change
    in pressure. The method is intended for use with concretes and mortars made with
    relatively dense aggregates for which the aggregate correction factor can be satisfactorily
    determined by the technique described in clause 5. It is not applicable to concretes
    made with lightweight aggregates, air-cooled blast-furnace slag, or aggregates
    of high porosity.
