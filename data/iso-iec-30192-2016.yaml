  content: "ISO 30192:2016 specifies the mechanical, physical and optical characteristics
    of a 120 mm rewritable optical disk with a capacity of 25,0 Gbytes or 50,0 Gbytes.
    It specifies the quality of the recorded and unrecorded signals, the format of
    the data and the recording method, thereby allowing for information interchange
    by means of such disks. User data can be written, read and overwritten many times
    using a reversible method. A conforming disk is identified as a BD Rewritable
    disk. \nISO 30192:2016 specifies the following:\n- -      two related but different
    Types of this disk;\n- -      conditions for conformance;\n- -      environments
    in which the disk is to be operated and stored; \n- -      mechanical and physical
    characteristics of the disk, which allow mechanical interchange between data processing
    systems;\n- -      format of the information on the disk, including the physical
    disposition of the Tracks and Sectors;\n- -      error-correcting codes and coding
    method used;\n- -      characteristics of the signals recorded on the disk, which
    enable data processing systems to read data from the disk. \nThis International
    Standard provides for interchange of disks between drives. Together with a standard
    for volume and file structure, it provides for full data interchange between data
    processing systems."
