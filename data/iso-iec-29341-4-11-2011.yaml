abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 29341-4-11:2011(E) describes the service-type which enables modeling
    of streaming capabilities of A/V devices, and binding of those capabilities between
    devices. Each device that is able to send or receive a stream according to the
    UPnP AV Architecture will have 1 instance of the ConnectionManager service. This
    service provides a mechanism for control points to:                          \na)
    Perform capability matching between source/server devices and sink/renderer devices,
    \                                   \nb) Find information about currently ongoing
    transfers in the network,                                                  \nc)
    Setup and teardown connections between devices (when required by the streaming
    protocol).                                     \nThis service definition is compliant
    with the UPnP Device Architecture version 1.0. This International Standard replaces
    ISO/IEC 29341-4-11, first edition, published in 2008, and constitutes a technical
    revision."
