  content: ISO/IEC 30140-2:20017(E) This part of ISO/IEC 30140 provides an underwater
    acoustic sensor network (UWASN) conceptual model by identifying and defining three
    domains (application domain, network domain and UWASN domain). It also provides
    multiple reference architecture views consistent with the requirements defined
    in ISO/IEC 30140-1 (systems reference architecture, communication reference architecture
    and information reference architecture). For each view, related physical and functional
    entities are described.
