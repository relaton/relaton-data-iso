abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC TS 29140-1:2011 provides guidance regarding learning, education
    and training (LET) situations in which learners are nomadic (travel from place
    to place, from one location to another or require access to services as they travel
    to different locations). It can be used as a reference by software developers,
    implementers, instructional designers, and others to ensure that LET environments
    reflect the specific needs of these learners. Specifically, ISO/IEC TS 29140-1:2011
    provides\n-       a definition of nomadicity within LET, \n-       a nomadicity
    reference model indicating the elements required to support learners engaged in
    activities within LET environments that involve nomadicity, \n-       a description
    of the elements and relationships between the elements, and\n-       an introduction
    to the characteristics of nomadicity that impact on LET activities.\nISO/IEC TS
    29140-1:2011 also identifies ITLET standards and fields of standardization within
    ITLET impacted by nomadicity and may be used as a basis for further standardization
    work and harmonization efforts.\nISO/IEC TS 29140-1:2011 is intended to support
    interoperability by providing a nomadicity reference model that can be used by
    developers, implementers, instructional designers, and others. ISO/IEC TS 29140-2
    provides a learner information model specific to mobile learning that can be used
    as a reference by software developers, implementers, instructional designers,
    teachers, instructors, and others to ensure that LET environments reflect the
    specific needs of mobile learners. \nIt is essential to differentiate between
    nomadicity and mobile learning approaches because the former is considered to
    be independent of the ICT involved. A concise view and understanding is needed
    of how nomadic learners' needs and requirements can be met using standardization
    efforts. The focus of ISO/IEC TS 29140-1:2011 is to ensure that not only is the
    concept of \"nomadicity\" understood, but that the user needs and requirements
    have been addressed. "
