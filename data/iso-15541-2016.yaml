- content: |-
    ISO 15541:2016 specifies requirements for a test bench to determine the fire resistance of non-metallic hose assemblies and non-metallic compensators with nominal diameter up to 150 mm. It may be used for bigger sizes provided proper test bench conditions are obtained. During the exposure to flames, there are possible working pressures of up to 16 bar.
    The flame spread ability of non-metallic hose assemblies or non-metallic compensators cannot be tested with the test bench specified in this document.
    Only water is permitted as a test medium. With a view to ensuring maximum safety for both the operating personnel and the test bench in the event of damage of the non-metallic hose assembly or non-metallic compensator during the test, the use of combustible test media is excluded.
