    This International Standard specifies a test method for simulating the lateral impact between the front of a motor vehicle (as defined in ISO 3833) of up to 3,5 tonnes GVM (gross vehicle mass) and an adult pedestrian.
    The test method addresses the reduction of pedestrian thigh, leg and knee injuries. It is not applicable to testing for, or the evaluation of, injuries to other pedestrian body regions; nor does it directly cover the potential risk of injury to children or human soft tissue. It is not applicable to vehicles with deployable devices designed for activation in the event of impact with a pedestrian. However, research suggests that safety improvements in vehicles derived from such pedestrian impact tests would also be beneficial to motorcyclists and bicyclists.
