- content: |-
    ISO/IEC TS 33073:2017:
    -      defines an integrated PRM and PAM that meets the requirements of ISO/IEC 33004 and that supports the performance of an assessment by providing indicators for guidance on the interpretation of the process purposes and outcomes and the process attributes as defined in ISO/IEC 33020;
    -      provides guidance, by example, on the definition, selection and use of assessment indicators.
    A PAM comprises a set of indicators of process performance and process capability. The indicators are used as a basis for collecting the objective evidence that enables an assessor to assign ratings. The set of indicators included in ISO/IEC TS 33073:2017 is not intended to be an all-inclusive set nor is it intended to be applicable in its entirety.
    The PAM in ISO/IEC TS 33073:2017 is directed at assessment sponsors and competent assessors who wish to select a model and associated documented process method for assessment (for either capability determination or process improvement). Additionally, it can be of use to developers of assessment models in the construction of their own model, by providing examples of good service management practices. It can be used by:
    a)    service providers to assess and improve a Quality Management System (QMS);
    b)    service providers to demonstrate their capability for the design, development, transition and delivery of services that fulfil Quality Management requirements.
    Any PAM meeting the requirements defined in ISO/IEC 33004 concerning models for process assessment may be used for assessment. Different models and methods can be needed to address differing business needs. The assessment model in ISO/IEC TS 33073:2017 is provided as an assessment model meeting all the requirements expressed in ISO/IEC 33004.
    NOTE       Copyright release for the PAM: Users of ISO/IEC TS 33073:2017 can freely reproduce the detailed descriptions contained in the assessment model as part of any tool or other material to support the performance of process assessments, so that it can be used for its intended purpose.
