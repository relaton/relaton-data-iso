abstract:
- content: |-
    ISO/IEC 11770-3:2008 defines key management mechanisms based on asymmetric cryptographic techniques. It specifically addresses the use of asymmetric techniques to achieve the following goals.
    Some of the mechanisms of ISO/IEC 11770-3:2008 are based on the corresponding authentication mechanisms in ISO/IEC 9798-3.
    ISO/IEC 11770-3:2008 does not cover aspects of key management such as
    - key lifecycle management,
    - mechanisms to generate or validate asymmetric key pairs,
    - mechanisms to store, archive, delete, destroy, etc. keys.
    While ISO/IEC 11770-3:2008 does not explicitly cover the distribution of an entity's private key (of an asymmetric key pair) from a trusted third party to a requesting entity, the key transport mechanisms described can be used to achieve this. A private key can in all cases be distributed with these mechanisms where an existing, non-compromised key already exists. However, in practice the distribution of private keys is usually a manual process that relies on technological means like smart cards, etc.
    ISO/IEC 11770-3:2008 does not cover the implementations of the transformations used in the key management mechanisms.
