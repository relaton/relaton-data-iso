  content: ISO 19013-1:2005 specifies the requirements for rubber tubing and hoses
    used in diesel fuel circuits for internal combustion engines. The diesel fuels
    covered include 'bio-diesels' which consist of the methyl ester of rape seed oil
    at levels up to 20 % by volume in conventional diesel fuels. In addition, this
    specification may also be applied as a classification system to enable original
    equipment manufacturers (OEMs) to detail a 'line call-out' of tests for specific
    applications where these are not covered by the main types specified. In this
    case, the hose or tubing would not carry any marking showing the number of this
    part of ISO 19013 but may detail the OEM's own identification markings as shown
    on their part drawings.
