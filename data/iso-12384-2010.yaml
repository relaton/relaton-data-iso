    ISO 12384:2010 specifies the requirements for digital measuring methods and digital measuring equipment for aircraft electrical power characteristics, including accuracy, algorithms and digital measuring equipment. The measuring equipment should be applied mainly for the use of laboratory or rig tests.
    ISO 12384:2010 can be applied to digital measuring equipment which is involved in the measurement of power electrical characteristics of the power supply system, power distributing systems and the utilization of equipment in aircrafts.
