abstract:
- content: Applicable to determining the quantities contained either in all the test
    solution or in the aliquot portion of between 1 g and 20 g that is taken for the
    determination. The principle bases on the reduction of the arsenic by zinc in
    a hydrochloric acid medium with the formation of arsine; absorption of the arsine
    in a solution of silver diethyldithiocarbamate in pyridine. Photometric measurement
    of the purplish-red colour produced by the colloidally dispersed silver at the
    maximum of the absorption curve at a wavelength of about 540 nm.
