abstract:
- content: "This document specifies test conditions and test procedures for determining
    the performance characteristics of air to water heat pumps for space heating and/or
    space cooling with electrically driven compressors with or without supplementary
    heater. The purpose of this document is to rate the performance of the air to
    water heat pumps for space heating and/or space cooling. \nIn the case of air
    to water heat pumps for space heating and/or space cooling consisting of several
    parts with refrigerant or water connections, this document applies only to those
    designed and supplied as a complete package. This document does not apply to large
    chiller or large liquid chilling package for space cooling and/or heating. \nThis
    document does not apply to air to water heat pumps not intended for human comfort.\nNOTE         
    Testing procedures for simultaneous operation for hot water supply and space heating
    and/or space cooling are not treated in this document. Simultaneous means that
    hot water supply and space heating and/or space cooling generation occur at the
    same time and can interact."
