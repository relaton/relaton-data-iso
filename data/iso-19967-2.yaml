    This ISO 19967-2 specifies the performance testing, standard conditions and the test methods for determining the capacity and efficiency rating of heat pump water heaters for space cooling and heating. Previous version was covered only heat pump water heater for space heating. This will be revised to include heat pump water heaters for space heating and/or cooling.
    This standard does not apply to any chiller or liquid chilling package for space cooling.
