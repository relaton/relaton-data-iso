abstract:
- content: "The document specifies all common test cases to be applied to and correctly
    handled by EVs (EVCC) and EVSEs (SECC) implementing ISO 15118-20 that are independent
    of a particular charging type (AC, DC, ACD, WPT charging). The document considers
    the use cases defined in ISO 15118-1:2019\nThe test system will comprise:\n-\tA
    simulated SECC to verify the correct behaviour of a real EVCC\n-\tA simulated
    EVCC to verify the correct behaviour of a real SECC\nThe document specifies test
    cases for all requirements defined in ISO 15118-20, verifying at least the following
    aspects:\n-\tCharge spot discovery and initialization of communication (TCP /
    TLS connection establishment).\n-\tSession establishment, session interruption
    and session re-establishment.\n-\tAuthentication process for charging session
    (e.g. EIM and PNC)\n-\tService discovery and selection\n-\tCommon and charging
    type independent service implementation\n-\tTermination of charging session\n-\tError
    handling\nThe test cases cover positive tests (according to ISO 15118-20). In
    addition, error scenarios (e.g., incorrectly formatted requests, invalid content
    of messages, etc.) as well as tests for timing behaviour are defined which are
    also handled by EVCC and SECC ensuring interoperability between EVs and EVSEs.\nThe
    test cases will be structured according to OSI-layers 3 to 7 depending on their
    testability from a (non-) functional perspective (e.g., IPv6, TCP, TLS.\nThe test
    cases will include standard test case attributes like pre-conditions, test behaviours,
    expected results to evaluate pass or fail and post-conditions to be applied returning
    the system under test to a safe state."
