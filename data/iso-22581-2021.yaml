abstract:
- content: This document is provided to assist in the surface analysis of thin films
    on materials which are not thought to contain carbon compounds as intended components
    but for which a C1s peak is observed in the survey spectrum. The films can be
    those generated on metals and alloys by aerobic or electrochemical oxidation or
    be those deposited on inert substrates. The procedure described is not suitable
    for discontinuous deposits of particles on a substrate. With this exception, a
    simple procedure is provided for identifying the C1s signal from carbon-containing
    surface contamination. When the C1s peak is identified as arising from an adventitious
    over-layer the composition derived from the survey spectrum can be corrected for
    its influence. Recommended procedures are provided in the form of simple Rules
    structured in the 'If  - Then` format with the intention that the information
    they embody might be utilised by automated procedures in data-systems. The rules
    provided utilize only information retrieved from the XPS survey scan.
