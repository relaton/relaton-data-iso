    This standard specifies a test method for determining the resistance to water leakage and penetration
    of water resistant clothing in an artificial rainfall by means of a manikin capable of marching motion. It
    becomes effective for determining the waterproof characteristic in practical use in a rainfall environment
    with the wearer moving. It is applicable to the testing of waterproof or water repellent product such as
    jacket, trousers, coats and one or two piece suits.This standard is not applicable to the testing of
    garments for durability against other weather conditions.
