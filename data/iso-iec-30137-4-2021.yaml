    This document establishes requirements for the annotation of humans, human faces and other body parts, and arbitrary objects appearing in imagery. It specifies the following:
    —    metadata to be inserted in a video stream;
    —    encoding of full and partial spatial and temporal ground truth information for:
    —    objects present in a video, and
    —    objects absent in a video;
    —    procedures for different annotation of known and unknown subjects.
    This document does not specify:
    —    encoding of video data.
