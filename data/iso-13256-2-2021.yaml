    1.1  This document establishes performance testing and rating criteria for factory-made residential, commercial and industrial, electrically-driven, mechanical- compression type, water-to-water and brine-to-water heat pumps. The requirements for testing and rating contained in this document are based on the use of matched assemblies.
    1.2  Equipment may be designed for rating at one or several source and load side temperature conditions described in this document.
    1.3  This document does not apply to the testing and rating of individual assemblies for separate use, nor to the testing and rating of heat pumps covered in ISO 5151, ISO 13253 or ISO 13256-1.
