abstract:
- content: "This document specifies the measurement methods and strategies for determining
    the total number of airborne particles per unit volume of air indoor, using a
    condensation particle counter (CPC) for particles approximately between 10 nm
    to 3 µm.\nNOTE      As the particle number concentration is usually dominated
    by the ultrafine particle (UFP) fraction, the obtained result can be used as an
    approximation of the UFP concentration.\nQuality assurance, determination of the
    measurement uncertainty and minimal reporting information are also discussed in
    this document.\nThis document is applicable to indoor environments as specified
    in ISO 16000-1.\nThis document does not address the determination of bioaerosols
    or the chemical characterization of particles. Nevertheless, some bioaerosols
    can be detected by the CPC and then contribute to the measured count of particles. "
