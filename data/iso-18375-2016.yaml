    ISO 18375:2016 describes an open-loop test method for determining the yaw stability of a vehicle on a low friction road surface. It applies to heavy vehicles, that is commercial vehicles, commercial vehicle combinations, buses and articulated buses as defined in ISO 3833 (trucks and trailers with maximum weight above 3,5 tonnes and buses and articulated buses with maximum weight above 5 tonnes, according to ECE and EC vehicle classification, categories M3, N2, N3, O3 and O4).
    The method is intended for vehicles equipped with electronic yaw-stability control systems.
    As the results of this test depend largely on local and temporary changes in road surface friction, this International Standard gives recommendations about keeping the friction level as uniform as possible for good reproducibility of the test results.
