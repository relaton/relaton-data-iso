  content: Specifies the standard conditions on which the ratings of single-package
    and split-system non-ducted air conditioners employing air- and water-cooled condensers
    are based, and the test methods to be applied for determination of the various
    ratings. Is limited to systems utilizing a single refrigeration circuit and having
    one evaporator and one condenser. Also specifies the test conditions and the corresponding
    test procedures for determining various performance characteristics of these non-ducted
    air conditioners and heat pumps.
