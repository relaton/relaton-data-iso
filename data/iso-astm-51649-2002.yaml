    ISO/ASTM 51649 covers dosimetric procedures to be followed in facility characterization, process qualification and routine processing using electron beam radiation in order to ensure that the entire product has been treated with an acceptable range of absorbed doses. Other procedures related to facility characterization (including equipment documentation), process qualification and routine product processing that may influence and may be used to monitor absorbed dose in the product are also discussed.
    The electron energy range covered by this International Standard is between 300 keV and 25 MeV, although other energy levels are discussed.
    Dosimetry is only one component of a total quality assurance programme for an irradiation facility. Other controls besides dosimetry may be required for specific applications such as medical device sterilization and food preservation.
