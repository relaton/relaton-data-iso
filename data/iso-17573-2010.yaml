    ISO 17573:2010 defines the architecture of a toll system environment in which a customer with one contract can use a vehicle in a variety of toll domains and with a different Toll Charger for each domain.
    Toll systems covered by ISO 17573:2010 can be used for various purposes including road (network) tolling, area tolling, collecting toll for bridges, tunnels, ferries, for access, and for parking. From a technical point of view the considered toll systems use electronic equipment on board a vehicle.
    From a process point of view the architectural description focuses on toll determination, toll charging, and the associated enforcement measures. The actual collection of the toll, i.e. collecting payments, is not included.
    The architecture in ISO 17573:2010 is defined with no more details than those required for an overall overview, a common language, an identification of the need for other standards, and the drafting of these standards.
