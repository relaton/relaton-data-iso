    ISO/IEC 24712:2007 defines colour test pages for the measurement of consumable yield. The test page suite includes four "customer" type documents and one "diagnostic" page that is used to determine end of ink or toner consumable life. These pages can be used for electro-photographic, inkjet printers and multi-function devices that have a digital printing path, i.e. an all-in-one electro-photographic machine that has digital printing capabilities.
    ISO/IEC 24712:2007 provides a set of test pages in a common file format that would be used in the testing of consumable yield. The procedure for using these pages is detailed in ISO/IEC 19798 and ISO/IEC 24711.
    These pages are intended to represent some of the document types that are used in the office and home. They are not intended to represent special applications such as photo printing.
