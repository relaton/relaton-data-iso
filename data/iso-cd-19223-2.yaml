  content: "Terminology, definitions, semantics and their rationale for high-frequency
    ventilators as defined in ISO 80601-2-87:2021, Medical electrical equipment—Part
    2-87: Particular requirements for basic safety and essential performance of high-frequency
    ventilators. These devices include those\n•\tcapable of providing more than 150
    inflations/min..\nThere are three principal designations of HFV:\n•\t— high-frequency
    percussive ventilation [HFPV, with a typical HFV frequency of (60 to 1 000) HFV
    inflations/min];\n•\t— high-frequency jet ventilation [HFJV, with a typical HFV
    frequency of (100 to 1 500) HFV inflations/min]; and\n•\t— high-frequency oscillatory
    ventilation [HFOV, with a typical HFV frequency of (180 to 1200) HFV inflations/min
    and typically having an active expiratory phase."
