  content: "ISO/IEC 29341-26-12:2017 is compliant with [1]. It defines a service type
    referred to herein as Messaging service. \nThe Messaging service is a UPnP service
    that allows control points to use the messaging features provided by a Telephony
    Server (TS) or a Telephony Client (TC). \nIt provides in the UPnP network the
    overall set of messaging capabilities of a phone (e.g., smartphone, IP phone,
    VoIP gateway, etc.), as the role of a TS. Additionally, or as an alternative,
    a device with the role of a TC can provide the Messaging service via UPnP Telephony.
    \nThis service provides the control points with the following functionalities:\n-
    \          Page Mode Messaging (e.g., e-Mail, SMS, MMS, etc.): notification of
    incoming messages, reading messages, sending a message, deleting a message.\n-
    \          Session Mode Messaging (e.g., Instant Messaging, SMS, etc.): notification
    of incoming messages, retrieving and sending the messages within a session, creating,
    modifying or closing a messaging session.\n-           File transfer session,
    to transfer the files in near real time.\nThis service does not provide the following
    functionalities:\n-           Connection to a remote server for sending or receiving
    the messages (e.g., WAN side);\n-           Rendering of message notifications
    and messages to the end user;\n-           Configuring the Messaging service with
    account for connecting to remote servers;"
