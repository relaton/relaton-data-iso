abstract:
- content: "This International Standard specifies the main dimensions, location and
    number of fittings, materials and quality of manufacture for small weathertight
    steel hatches for application on board ships in order to ensure interchangeability
    of the hatches. The remaining dimensions are left to the manufacturer. The hatches
    are suitable for loading operations and for giving access to storage compartments
    and dry cargo holds. \nThe hatches are not suitable as an access to any kind of
    tanks and shall not be used as escape hatches. \nThese hatches generally conform
    to the requirements of the International Convention on Load Lines 1966 (LLC66).
    The possibility for application in position 1 and position 2 has to be considered
    for each situation and, where necessary, the hatch covers shall be provided with
    additional stiffening. \nNOTE — Users of this International Standard should note
    that while observing the requirements of this standard, they should, at the same
    time, ensure compliance with such statutory requirements, rules and regulations
    as may be applicable to the individual ship concerned."
