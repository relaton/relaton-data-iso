    ISO 9276-2:2014 provides relevant equations and coherent nomenclatures for the calculation of moments, mean particle sizes and standard deviations from a given particle size distribution. Two notation systems in common use are described. One is the method of moments while the second describes the moment-ratio method. The size distribution may be available as a histogram or as an analytical function.
    The equivalent diameter of a particle of any shape is taken as the size of that particle. Particle shape factors are not taken into account. Samples of particles measured are intended to be representative of the population of particles.
    For both notation systems, numerical examples of the calculation of mean particle sizes and standard deviation from histogram data are presented in an annex.
