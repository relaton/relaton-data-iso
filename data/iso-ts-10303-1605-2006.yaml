  content: "ISO/TS 10303-1605:2006 specifies the application module for AP210 assembly
    functional requirements. \nISO/TS 10303-1605:2006 deals with the representation
    of assembly functional requirement. This data includes all information required
    to specify the behaviour of the assembly, including interface definition.\nExplicit
    structural definition is provided for the functional network, including representations
    of folded and elaborated network hierarchy. This includes gate allocation information.
    \nExplicit allocation of each functional network element to the implementing component
    is included. Extensive use of formal encapsulation is provided for signal definition,
    mathematical models, etc. This data includes information required to support embedded
    components in an interconnect product. \nConfiguration management information
    and design management information is provided. \nISO/TS 10303-1605:2006 deals
    with the following:\n- nodal network representation of the behaviour of the product;
    \n- allocation of functional elements in the hierarchical network representation
    to physical components that implement the functionality; \n- mapping the set of
    nodes in the hierarchical network representation to the single physical node that
    is the elaboration of those nodes; \n- configuration management of the information;
    \n- extensive use of formal encapsulation is provided for signal definition, mathematical
    models; \n- the information is from an electro-mechanical design and analysis
    viewpoint but is more widely applicable. "
