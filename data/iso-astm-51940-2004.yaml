    ISO/ASTM 51940:2004 outlines dosimetric procedures to be followed for the radiation sterilization of live insects for use in pest management programs. The procedures outlined in ISO/ASTM 51940:2004 will help ensure that insects processed with ionizing radiation from gamma, electron, or X-ray sources receive absorbed doses within a predetermined range. Information on effective dose ranges for specific applications of insect sterilization, or on methodology for determining effective dose ranges, is not within the scope of ISO/ASTM 51940:2004.
    ISO/ASTM 51940:2004 covers dosimetry in the irradiation of insects for these types of irradiators: self-contained dry-storage 137Cs or 60Co irradiators, large-scale gamma irradiators, and electron accelerators. The absorbed dose for insect sterilization is typically within the range of 20 Gy to 600 Gy.
    ISO/ASTM 51940:2004 refers, throughout the text, specifically to reproductive sterilization of insects. It is equally applicable to radiation sterilization of invertebrates from other taxa (for example, Acarina, Gastropoda) and to irradiation of live insects or other invertebrates for other purposes (for example, inducing mutations), provided the absorbed dose is within the range specified.
    ISO/ASTM 51940:2004 also covers the use of radiation-sensitive indicators for the visual and qualitative indication that the insects have been irradiated.
    ISO/ASTM 51940:2004 does not purport to address all of the safety concerns, if any, associated with its use.
