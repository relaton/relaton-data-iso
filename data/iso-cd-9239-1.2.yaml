    This part of ISO 9239 specifies a method for assessing the wind-opposed burning behaviour and spread of flame of horizontally mounted floorings exposed to a heat flux radiant gradient in a test chamber, when ignited with pilot flames. Annex A gives details of assessing the smoke development, when required.

    This method is applicable to all types of flooring, e.g. textile carpet, cork, wood, rubber and plastics coverings as well as coatings. Results obtained by this method reflect the performance of the flooring, including any substrate if used. Modifications of the backing, bonding to a substrate, underlay or other changes of the flooring may affect test results.

    This part of ISO 9239 is applicable to the measurement and description of the properties of floorings in response to heat and flame under controlled laboratory conditions. It should not be used alone to describe or appraise the fire hazard or fire risk of floorings under actual fire conditions.

    Information on the precision of the test method is given in Annex B.
