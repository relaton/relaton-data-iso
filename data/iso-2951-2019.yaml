    This document specifies a method for the determination of the insulation resistance of vulcanized and thermoplastic rubbers without discrimination between the volume and surface resistances involved. This method is applicable only to the test pieces with a resistance greater than 108 Ω.
    NOTE       Methods of test for test pieces with a lower resistance are described in ISO 1853 and ISO 2878.
    Because the test pieces are simply and easily prepared, this method is particularly useful for rapidly determining values which will give a general indication of quality when great accuracy is not required.
