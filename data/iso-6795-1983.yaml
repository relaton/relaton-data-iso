  content: The free alcohol is reacted with vanadium(V) sodium salt of quinolin-8-ol(8-hydroxyquinoline)
    to form a coloured complex. The complex is extracted with toluene and then treated
    with dichloroacetic acid. The spectrometric measurement is carried out at a wavelength
    of about 620 nm. The method is applicable to products having free alcohol contents
    between 0,01 and 5,0 % (m/m).
