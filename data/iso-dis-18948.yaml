    This document specifies test methods to assess the permanence and durability of photo books, including cover and pages.
    This document is applicable to photo books which contain reflection colour prints made with colour hardcopy materials of all types, including those from either traditional analogue printing or modern digital printing processes. The same performance test methods apply, regardless of the printing process. Because of the large number of combinations of sizes, cover materials, binding options and printing processes, testing of all possible combinations is not within the scope of this document. Instead, a representative selection of printed pages, cover materials and binding options that are used in the makeup of the photo book are tested.
