  content: ISO/IEC 15045-2:2012(E) specifies a gateway architecture that provides
    an interconnection between one or more Wide Area Networks (WANs) and one or more
    Home Area Networks (HANs). It is not needed for a "simple gateway" linking one
    WAN to one HAN where there is no intention of future expansion. It applies to
    a "distributed gateway," and is also referred to in ISO/IEC 15045-1 as the Complex
    Modular Gateway. Also, it specifies how separate gateways in a single house can
    interoperate to provide co-ordinated functions.
