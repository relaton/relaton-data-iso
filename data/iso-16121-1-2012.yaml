    ISO 16121-1:2012 applies to the driver's workplace in low-floor line-service buses designed for the carriage of passengers, comprising more than eight seats in addition to the driver's seat, and having a maximum weight exceeding five metric tonnes and an overall width exceeding 2,30 m.
    ISO 16121-1:2012 contains basic requirements for an ergonomic and comfortable seating position, which is essential to keep drivers in a good state of health. The dimensions and mounting positions of a driver's seat, pedals and steering should be carefully chosen to enable drivers to sit in an ergonomic seating position, i.e. sitting at angles which comply with the given ranges of comfort and to allow some variation when seated.
