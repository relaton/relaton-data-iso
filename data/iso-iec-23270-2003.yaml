abstract:
- content: |-
    ISO/IEC 23270:2003 specifies the form and establishes the interpretation of programs written in the C# programming language. It specifies:
    - the representation of C# programs;
    - the syntax and constraints of the C# language;
    - the semantic rules for interpreting C# programs;
    - the restrictions and limits imposed by a conforming implementation of C#.
    ISO/IEC 23270:2003 does not specify:
    - the mechanism by which C# programs are transformed for use by a data-processing system;
    - the mechanism by which C# applications are invoked for use by a data-processing system;
    - the mechanism by which input data are transformed for use by a C# application;
    - the mechanism by which output data are transformed after being produced by a C# application;
    - the size or complexity of a program and its data that will exceed the capacity of any specific data-processing system or the capacity of a particular processor;
    - all minimal requirements of a data-processing system that is capable of supporting a conforming implementation.
