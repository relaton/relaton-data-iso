abstract:
- content: "ISO 29473:2010 gives guidance on the evaluation and expression of uncertainty
    of fire test method measurements. \nApplication of ISO 29473:2010 is limited to
    tests that provide quantitative results in engineering units. This includes, for
    example, methods for measuring the heat release rate of burning specimens based
    on oxygen consumption calorimetry, as in ISO 5660-1:2002\nISO 29473:2010 does
    not apply to tests that provide results in the form of indices or binary results
    (e.g. pass/fail)."
