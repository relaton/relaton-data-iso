- content: |-
    This document provides the basis, requirements and guidance for assessing the level of performance, process and interoperability of community infrastructure(s) as well as its contribution to the community using a CIMM. It also helps stakeholders set targets for improvement that will guide investment by identifying gaps in the current level of community infrastructure.
    This document is applicable to:
    a)       all types of community infrastructure, including, but not limited to, energy, water, transportation, waste and ICT;
    b)       single types of community infrastructure or multiple types of community infrastructure;
    c)        all types of communities, regardless of geographical location, size, economic structure, or stage of economic development;
    d)       all applicable stages of the infrastructure life cycle (e.g. planning, design, construction, operation and decommissioning).
    NOTE          The use of natural systems, such as green infrastructure, is considered a type of infrastructure.
