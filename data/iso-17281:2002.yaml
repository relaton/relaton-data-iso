- content: |-
    ISO 17281 provides guidelines for determining the fracture toughness of plastics in the crack-opening mode (Mode I) by a linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEMF) approach, at load-point displacement rates of up to 1 m/s. It supplements ISO 13586 so as to extend its applicability to loading rates somewhat higher than is the case in the scope of the latter International Standard.
    The general principles, methods and rules given in ISO 13586 for fracture testing at low loading rates remain valid and should be followed except where expressly stated otherwise in this International Standard.
    The methods are suitable for use with the same range of materials as covered by ISO 13586.
    Although the dynamic effects occurring at high loading rates are largely dependent on the material tested as well as on the test equipment and test geometry used, the guidelines given here are valid in general, irrespective of test equipment, test geometry and material tested.
    The same restrictions as to linearity of the load-displacement diagram, specimen size and notch tip sharpness apply as for ISO 13586.
