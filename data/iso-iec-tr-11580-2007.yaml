  content: "ISO/IEC TR 11580:2007 defines a format for describing user interface objects,
    actions and attributes. It provides a basis for standardizing the names and properties
    of user interface objects, actions and attributes across multiple applications
    and platforms.\nISO/IEC TR 11580:2007 contains guidance both on the standardization
    of user interface objects, actions and attributes and on the implementation of
    these objects, actions and attributes in any or all modalities. It is primarily
    intended for developers of standards, style guides and architectures involving
    user interface objects, actions and attributes. \nISO/IEC TR 11580:2007 also provides
    software developers with a range of functionalities to be considered in the design
    of objects, actions and attributes within user interfaces."
