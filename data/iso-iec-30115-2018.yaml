    ISO/IEC 30115:2018:
    The Redfish Scalable Platforms Management API ("Redfish") is a new specification that uses RESTful interface semantics to access data defined in model format to perform out-of-band systems management. It is suitable for a wide range of servers, from stand-alone servers to rack mount and bladed environments but scales equally well for large scale cloud environments.
    There are several out-of-band systems management standards (defacto and de jour) available in the industry. They all either vary widely in implementation, were developed for single server embedded environments or have their roots in antiquated software modeling constructs. There is no single industry standard that is simple to use, based on emerging programming standards, embedded friendly and capable of meeting large scale data center & cloud needs.
