abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: The purpose of ISO/TR 10809-1:2009 is to assist the designer and engineer
    in understanding the family of cast iron materials and to utilize them with a
    more complete knowledge of their potential, among the wide range of other engineering
    materials and fabrication methods now available. A considerable amount of the
    data provided is metallurgical, but it is usually the metallurgical aspects of
    the cast irons that create misunderstandings when these materials are specified.
    This is because metallurgy is not one of the scientific disciplines taught to
    engineering students. Thus, such students often have a lack of knowledge regarding
    the fundamentals underpinning the material properties of cast irons. ISO/TR 10809-1:2009
    suggests what can be achieved, what cannot be achieved and why, if and when cast
    irons are specified. It is not designed to be a textbook of metallurgy. It is
    intended to help people to choose the correct material for the right reasons and
    also to help to obviate the specification or expectation of unrealistic additional
    requirements, which are unlikely to be met and which can be detrimental to the
    intended application.
