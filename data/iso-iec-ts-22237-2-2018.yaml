    ISO/IEC TS 22237-2:2018 addresses the construction of buildings and other structures which provide accommodation for data centres based upon the criteria and classification for "physical security" within ISO/IEC TS 22237‑1 in support of availability.
    ISO/IEC TS 22237-2:2018 specifies requirements and recommendations for the following:
    a)    location and site selection;
    b)    building construction;
    c)    building configuration;
    d)    fire protection;
    e)    quality construction measures.
    Safety and electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) requirements are outside the scope of this document and are covered by other standards and regulations. However, information given in this document may be of assistance in meeting these standards and regulations.
    Conformance of data centres to the present document is covered in Clause 4.
