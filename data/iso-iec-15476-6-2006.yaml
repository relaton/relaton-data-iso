  content: "ISO/IEC 15476-6:2006 defines the State/event subject area of the CDIF
    semantic metamodel. The CDIF semantic metamodel is used to ensure that the information
    transferred by tools communicating using CDIF is expressed with an agreed meaning.
    This subject area contains meta-objects that describe the entities of state transition
    diagrams and state transition tables, and also meta-relationships and meta-attributes
    that are necessary for available state transition. \nISO/IEC 15476-6:2006 is intended
    to be used by anyone wishing to understand and/or use CDIF. It provides a definition
    of a single subject area of the CDIF semantic metamodel. It is suitable for:\n-
    Those evaluating CDIF;\n- Those who wish to understand the principles and concepts
    of a CDIF transfer; and\n- Those developing importers and exporters."
