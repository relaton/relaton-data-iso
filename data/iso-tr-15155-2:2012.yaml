  content: ISO/TR 15155-2:2012 is intended to provide guidance on the operation of
    basic test facilities for irrigation equipment evaluation. Its purpose is to provide
    information sufficient to implement the detailed procedures included in ISO 7714,
    ISO 8026, ISO 9261, ISO 9635-1 to 5, ISO 9644, ISO 9911 and ISO 10522 and ISO
    15886-3 for the testing of agricultural irrigation system components, specifically
    emitters, sprinklers and valves. The intent is that the structure of tISO/TR 15155-2
    can be modified to be used as the operating manual of a test facility established
    to test the components referred to in these International Standards.
