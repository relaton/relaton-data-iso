- content: |-
    The purpose of this document is to define the Space Link Extension (SLE) Return Operational Control Fields (ROCF) service in conformance with the SLE Reference Model (reference [1]).  The ROCF service is an SLE transfer service that delivers to a mission user all operational control fields from one master channel or one virtual channel.
    This document defines, in an abstract manner, the ROCF service in terms of:
    It does not specify:
    NOTE   –    Reference [1] defines the Return Master Channel Operational Control Field (Rtn MC-OCF) service and the Return Virtual Channel Operational Control Field (Rtn VC-OCF) service as two distinct services. Subsequent study has indicated that it is preferable to define one service that provides the functionality of both. The ROCF service defined here does just that. It is anticipated that a future issue of reference [1] will take the same approach, deleting the Rtn MC-OCF and Rtn VC-OCF services and replacing them with the Rtn OCF service.
