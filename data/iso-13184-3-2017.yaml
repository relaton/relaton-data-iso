- content: |-
    ISO 13184-3:2017 specifies conformance tests for a self-conformance assessment of the supplier's P-ITS-S system. The conformance test cases follow the use case definition of ISO/TR 13184‑1 and the requirements stated in ISO 13184‑2 based on the Data eXchange Message (DXM) at the application level regarding the safety warning and parking guide services between
    -      the Vehicle ITS Station (V-ITS-S) installed in the vehicle, or
    -      a Personal ITS Station (P-ITS-S), e.g. Nomadic Device, in a vehicle or used by a pedestrian, and
    -      a Roadside ITS Station (R-ITS-S) installed at the roadside.
    The primary but not exclusive purpose of this document is to provide information to the P-ITS-S system provider to build and test the P-ITS-S system against the conformance test cases. This final step in the development process of the P-ITS-S system ensures providers that their P-ITS-S system meets a high degree of functional requirements expected by the end user.
