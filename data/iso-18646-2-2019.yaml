    This document describes methods of specifying and evaluating the navigation performance of mobile service robots. Navigation performance in this document is measured by pose accuracy and repeatability, as well as the ability to detect and avoid obstacles. Other measures of navigation performance are available but are not covered in this document.
    The criteria and related test methods are applicable only to mobile platforms that are in contact with the travel surface. For evaluating the characteristics of manipulators, ISO 9283 applies.
    This document deals with indoor environments only. However, the depicted tests can also be applicable for robots operating in outdoor environments, as described in Annex A.
    This document is not applicable for the verification or validation of safety requirements. It does not deal with safety requirements for test personnel during testing.
