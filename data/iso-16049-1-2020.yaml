    This document specifies the design criteria and testing methods adequate to guarantee the ultimate load and operational dependability of cargo restraint strap assemblies with a typical 22 250 N (5 000 lbf) rated ultimate tension load capability, as used by the airline industry. These restraint straps are used in civil transport aircraft during flight for:
    a)   cargo loaded and tied down onto airworthiness approved air cargo pallets, themselves restrained into aircraft lower deck, main deck or upper deck cargo systems and meeting the requirements of ISO 8097 (NAS 3610) or ISO 21100, or
    b)   non-unitized individual pieces of cargo, or pieces of cargo placed onto an unrestrained ("floating") pallet into either lower deck, main deck or upper deck containerized cargo compartments of an aircraft,
    c)   the same restraint strap assemblies can also be used in other applications such as:
    1)   non-containerized (bulk loaded) baggage and cargo compartments;
    2)   to ensure cargo restraint inside an airworthiness approved air cargo container.
    NOTE    The ultimate loads allowable on the attachment points available in most aircraft bulk compartments and inside many air cargo containers are significantly lower than 22 250 N (5 000 lbf). This results in the restraint arrangements ultimate load capability being dictated by the weakest element, i.e. the attachment points: typical 22 250 N ultimate load restraint straps will therefore be in excess of the requirements for such applications.
    Compliance with this document provides one means of cargo restraint straps airworthiness approval by Civil Aviation Authorities under TSO/ETSO-C172a, in addition to the other requirements therein.
