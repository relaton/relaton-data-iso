  content: This document is directed specifically at the lower end of the concentration
    range covered in ISO 20847. By selecting the instrument type, a better signal-to-background
    ratio for sulfur K L2,3 emission is assured. A knowledge of the general composition
    of the sample for analysis is advantageous in obtaining the best test result.
    Compared to the previous version new fuels have been added to the scope. In addition,
    the precision and bias statements as well as the concentration range were updated
    based on results of a new interlaboratory study. This has been done for gasoline
    and diesel type fuels including new fuels HVO and GTL as well as for FAME type
    samples.
