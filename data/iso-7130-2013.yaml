abstract:
- content: ISO 7130:2013 provides a basis for content and methods used for operator
    training for earth-moving machinery as defined in ISO 6165. This training in turn
    provides the basis for developing operators of earth-moving machinery who are
    knowledgeable and understand the manufacturer's instructions for safe and proper
    operation and routine maintenance. It establishes criteria for evaluating the
    competency of a person who operates and could perform routine maintenance of earth-moving
    machinery, but does not specify any procedure for proficiency testing or assessment
    of the operator's competence of operating and maintaining earth-moving machinery.
    It is not intended to substitute for national or regional requirements or regulations
    related to operator training.
