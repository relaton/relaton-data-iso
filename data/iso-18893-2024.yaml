    This document applies to all mobile elevating work platforms (MEWPs) intended for moving a person(s) along with their necessary tools and materials at an elevated work location.
    This document specifies the requirements for selection, inspection, training, maintenance, repair and safe operation of MEWPs to achieve the following objectives:
    a)       eliminate or reduce accidents, personal injuries and property damage;
    b)       establish criteria for selection, inspection, training, maintenance, repair and safe operation;
    c)        help manufacturers, dealers, owners, users, operators, occupants and qualified persons to understand their responsibilities;
    d)       establish a process for reviews to verify compliance with this document;
    e)       provide a guide for governmental authorities desiring to formulate safety rules and regulations.
    In this document, MEWP classifications comprise a MEWP group (platform location in reference to tipping line) with an associated MEWP type (reference to travelling).
    This document is applicable to both new MEWPs put on the market and those MEWPs currently in service.
