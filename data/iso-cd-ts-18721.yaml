abstract:
- content: "This standard provides generic guidance on how core Ecological Soil Functions
    (ESF) can be evaluated in different contexts of land use and management (e.g.
    agricultural, forest or contaminated lands) for environmental monitoring. Ecological
    soil functions can be assessed the same way no matter which soil use is being
    considered. For each ESF, the standard specifically proposes biotic and abiotic
    parameters to be measured and associated indicators. It focuses on parameters
    and indicators that are either available as ISO standards or published in peer
    reviewed papers. \nThis document does not apply to non-ecological soil functions
    such as geotechnical functions (foundation support for buildings, tunnels, etc.)
    or geothermal functions. \nMethods based on proxy indicators (e.g. soil occupation,
    hydrography parameters) are not included in this standard."
