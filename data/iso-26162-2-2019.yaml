    This document specifies essential features of terminology management systems, regardless of specific software engineering paradigms, user interface and user assistance design principles, and specific data models. These features enable maximum efficiency and quality in terminology work and, thus, support creating, processing, and using high quality terminology. The intended audiences of this document are software engineers/developers as well as terminologists, technical communicators, translators, interpreters, language planners, and subject field experts.
    This document describes all features needed for recording, editing, maintaining, exchanging, and presenting terminological data. Term extraction features used to identify new terms are out of the scope of this document.
