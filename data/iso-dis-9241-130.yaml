    This part of ISO 9241 provides requirements and recommendations on user assistance, their nature,
    use and guidance on how to use them. This part of ISO 9241 is concerned with software
    components of interactive systems to make human-system interaction usable as far as the most
    basic interaction aspects are concerned.
    This part of ISO 9241 provides a list of generic user assistance guidelines regardless of a specific
    visualization and implementation technology. It gives guidance and recommendations on selection,
    usage and dependencies of user assistance and their applications in various contexts.
    It does not provide detailed coverage of the methods and techniques required for design and
    implementing of user assistance.
    The information in this part of ISO 9241 is intended for use by those responsible for developing user
    interfaces, but also for planning and managing platform specific aspects of user interface design. It
    therefore addresses technical issues only to the extent necessary to allow such individuals to
    understand the relevance and importance of a consistent interaction technique use in the design
    process. It also provides a framework for human factors and usability professionals involved in
    human-centred design. Detailed human factors, ergonomics, usability, and accessibility issues are
    dealt with more fully in a number of standards including other parts of ISO 9241 which sets out the
    broad principles of ergonomics (see Bibliography).
    Annex A provides a checklist that can be used to support claims of conformance to this standard.
