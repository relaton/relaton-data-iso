abstract:
- content: "This document describes generally applicable practices for improving the
    resource efficiency of data centres, independent of their application(s).\nThis
    document focuses on continuous improvement processes, designs and guidelines that
    prioritize resource efficiency. In general, the processes and practices are technology-neutral
    and are independent of location.\nThe practices for data centre resource efficiency
    improvement deal with various establishment and operation aspects such as data
    centre planning, management, cooling, power feeding, information and communications
    technology (ICT) and cost aspects that are not restricted by the scope of this
    document.\nThe following items are not included in the scope of this document:
    \n—    development of key performance indicators (KPIs);\n—    comparability between
    data centre performance results;\n—    definition of maturity model for data centres;\n—   
    social sustainability issues."
