    This document specifies a procedure for the assessment of the indoor air quality that is valid for all interior rooms in residential and non-residential buildings with natural or mechanical ventilation, in which people do not only stay temporarily.
    This document is applicable to indoor environments as defined in ISO 16000-1.
    The assessment of working materials in workrooms or workplaces in buildings, that are subject to statutory occupational safety specifications, are excluded from this document. In these rooms, only air constituents that do not originate from working materials can be assessed according to this document.
    It is not possible to define classes with exact values for the individual pollutants, as the corresponding limit and guide values differ in individual countries. In addition, the values relate to different observation periods.
    Aspects concerning electromagnetic fields, noise and vibrations and their effect on the indoor air quality are not the object of this document. The classification of further consequences and measures, such as organisational steps, structural engineering measures, renovation proposals, further human medicine appraisals and the like, are not the object of this document.
    NOTE       This document applies to of all types of indoor environments occupied by all kinds of persons, including regular users, clients and workers.
