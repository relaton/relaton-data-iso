  script: Latn
  content: ISO 20242-2:2010 defines a service interface that provides a generic service
    access point for managing and operating the resources supported by the operating
    system of a computer and its peripherals, including special hardware on plug-in
    boards that are used in computer-assisted testing applications. The resource management
    service interface is intended to be implemented in a manner that offers the exposed
    services of a computing platform adapter to be generic and independent of the
    operating system and its communication interfaces.
