    ISO 20581:2016 specifies general performance requirements for procedures for the determination of the concentration of chemical agents in workplace atmospheres. These requirements apply to all steps of measuring procedures regardless of the physical form of the chemical agent (gas, vapour, airborne particles), measuring procedures with separate sampling and analytical methods, and direct-reading devices.
    ISO 20581:2016 specifies requirements that have to be fulfilled by measuring procedures when tested under prescribed laboratory conditions due to a wide range of environmental conditions encountered in practice.
