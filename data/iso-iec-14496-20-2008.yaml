  content: "ISO/IEC 14496-20:2008 defines a scene description format (LASeR) and an
    aggregation format (SAF) respectively suitable for representing and delivering
    rich-media services to resource-constrained devices such as mobile phones.\nLASeR
    aims at fulfilling all the requirements of rich-media services at the scene description
    level. LASeR supports:\n- an optimized set of objects inherited from SVG to describe
    rich-media scenes,\n- a small set of key compatible extensions over SVG, \n- the
    ability to encode and transmit a LASeR stream and then reconstruct SVG content,\n-
    dynamic updating of the scene to achieve a reactive, smooth and continuous service,\n-
    simple yet efficient compression to improve delivery and parsing times, as well
    as storage size, one of the design goals being to allow both for a direct implementation
    of the SDL as documented, as well as for a decoder compliant with ISO/IEC 23001-1
    to decode the LASeR bitstream,\n- an efficient interface with audio and visual
    streams with frame-accurate synchronization,\n- use of any font format, including
    the OpenType industry standard, and\n- easy conversion from other popular rich-media
    formats in order to leverage existing content and developer communities. \nTechnology
    selection criteria for LASeR included compression efficiency, but also code and
    memory footprint and performance. Other aims included: scalability, adaptability
    to the user context, extensibility of the format, ability to define small profiles,
    feasibility of a J2ME implementation, error resilience and safety of implementations.
    \nSAF aims at fulfilling all the requirements of rich-media services at the interface
    between media/scene description and existing transport protocols: \n- simple aggregation
    of any type of stream, \n- signaling of MPEG and non-MPEG streams, \n- optimized
    packet headers for bandwidth-limited networks, \n- easy mapping to popular streaming
    formats,\n- cache management capability, and\n- extensibility. \nSAF has been
    designed to complement LASeR for simple, interactive services, bringing:\n- efficient
    and dynamic packaging to cope with high latency networks,\n- media interleaving,
    and\n- synchronization support with a very low overhead.\nISO/IEC 14496-20:2008
    defines the usage of SAF for LASeR content; however, LASeR can be used independently
    from SAF."
