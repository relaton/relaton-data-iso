  content: "The proposed project is a revision of ISO/IEC/IEEE 24748-1:2018, Guidelines
    for life cycle management. There are no scope changes. \nThe document provides
    guidelines for the life cycle management of systems and software, complementing
    the processes described in ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 and ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207. This document:\n—
    addresses systems concepts and life cycle concepts, models, stages, processes,
    process application, key points of view, adaptation and use in various domains
    and by various disciplines;\n— establishes a common framework for describing life
    cycles, including their individual stages, for the management of projects to provide,
    or acquire either products or services;\n— defines the concept and terminology
    of a life cycle;\n— supports the use of the life cycle processes within an organization
    or a project. Organizations and projects can use these life cycle concepts when
    acquiring and supplying either products or services;\n— provides guidance on adapting
    a life cycle model and the content associated with a life cycle or a part of a
    life cycle;\n— describes the relationship between life cycles and their use in
    applying the processes in  ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 (systems aspects) and ISO/IEC/IEEE
    12207 (software aspects);\n— shows the relationships of life cycle concepts to
    the hardware, human, services, process, procedure, facility and naturally occurring
    entity aspects of projects; and\n- describes how its concepts relate to detailed
    process standards, for example, in the areas of measurement, project management
    and risk management."
