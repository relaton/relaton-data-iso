  content: "ISO/IEC 15434:2006 defines the manner in which data is transferred to
    high-capacity automatic data capture (ADC) media from a supplier's information
    system and the manner in which data is transferred to the recipient's information
    system. It does not define the internal data storage format for specific high-capacity
    ADC media, nor does it specify the application of data structures provided by
    a specific data syntax format. The application of the data structure is specified
    by industry conventions.\nUsers of ADC technologies benefit by being able to receive
    data in a standard form and by being able to provide data in a standard form.
    Static ADC technologies such as bar code symbologies, magnetic stripe, optical
    character recognition, surface acoustical wave (SAW) and Weigand effect typically
    encode a single field of data. Most applications of these technologies involve
    the encoding of a single field of data by the supplier of the medium and the subsequent
    decoding of the data field by the recipient. Encoding single fields of data permits
    the supplier to perform the encodation from a single field within the supplier's
    information system. Decoding single fields of data permits the recipient to input
    this data into a single field in the recipient's information system, in lieu of
    key entry.\nHigh-capacity ADC technologies, such as two-dimensional symbols, RFID
    transponders, contact memories and smart cards, encode multiple fields of data.
    These multiple fields are usually parsed by the recipient's information system
    and then mapped to specific fields of data in the recipient's information system.
    ISO/IEC 15434:2006 defines the syntax for high-capacity ADC media, so as to enable
    ADC users to utilize a single mapping utility, regardless of which high-capacity
    ADC medium is employed.\nISO/IEC 15434:2006 specifies a transfer structure, syntax,
    and coding of messages and data formats when using high-capacity ADC media between
    trading partners (specifically between suppliers and recipients) and, where applicable,
    in support of carrier applications, such as bills of lading and carrier sortation
    and tracking.\nThe data encoded according to ISO/IEC 15434:2006 include\n- data
    which may be used in the shipping, receiving, and inventory of transport units;\n-
    data which may be contained within supporting documentation, in paper or electronic
    form, related to unit loads or transport packages;\n- data which may be used in
    the sortation and tracking of transport units.\nISO/IEC 15434:2006 describes the
    ISO 646 syntax for automatic data capture. \nISO/IEC 15434:2006 is not the controlling
    specification for data structures (e.g. CII) referenced in ISO/IEC 15434:2006.\nISO/IEC
    15434:2006 does not supersede or replace any applicable safety or regulatory marking
    or labelling requirements. It is to be applied in addition to any other mandated
    labelling requirements."
