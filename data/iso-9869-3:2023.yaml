abstract:
- content: |-
    This document describes a method for measuring the insulation performance of building elements, e.g. exterior walls, floors, ceilings (hereinafter referred to collectively as "walls"). This is done by using the probe insertion method, which gives the temperature distribution in the wall with a temperature sensor in a small diameter borehole in the wall.
    The measurement method is divided into a quantitative method, which measures the thermal resistance with a heat flow measurement, and a qualitative method without heat flow measurement.
    This document describes a screening test that is used for preliminary and practical diagnosis.
    The method is applicable to plane building components with a light heat capacity, such as those in frame structure dwellings. The measured results give the insulation performance at the local measurement points rather than that of the whole panel including thermal bridges such as studs.
