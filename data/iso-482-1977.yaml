  content: Specifies the methods of numbering aircraft engines, engine cylinders and
    combustion chambers, on drawings, for example, and the methods of describing the
    direction of rotation of main shafts and rotors and or propellers. The numbering
    of engines is given for horizontal thrust engines, vertical thrust engines and
    take-off booster engines. The numbering of cylinders in piston engines is given
    for in-line piston engines and radial piston engines. Furthermore the numbering
    of components in turbine engines and in rotorcraft engines is given.
