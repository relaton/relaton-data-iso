abstract:
- content: This document specifies functional requirements and reference interfaces
    for interconnected energy management agents (EMAs) based on the model for an EMA
    specified in ISO/IEC 15067-3 and the model for multiple interacting EMAs specified
    in ISO/IEC 15067-3-3. This specification supports energy management by facilitating
    interactions and information exchange among EMAs and appliances, consumer electronics,
    heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) equipment, water heaters, distributed
    energy resources (DERs), electric vehicle (EV) chargers, and other loads supplied
    by public and local power sources in a house or an apartment complex. Local power
    sources can use DER, which can include, but are not limited to, wind turbines,
    solar panels, and storage (stationary and mobile). EMAs specified with these functions
    and interfaces can assist the consumer in responding to price-varying public power
    and buying or selling transactive energy (TE). This document specifies framework
    methods for EMAs to co-ordinate the delivery of energy management applications,
    and the reference interfaces facilitate a communications protocol among interacting
    EMAs. These linked and interacting EMAs provide energy optimization and conservation
    within constraints such as a consumer's financial budget and goals for greenhouse
    gas reduction, while supporting programmes as diverse as TE and demand response
    (DR).
