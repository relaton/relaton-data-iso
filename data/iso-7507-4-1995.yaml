  content: Specifies a method for the calibration of vertical cylindrical tanks having
    diameters greater than 5 m by means of internal measurements using an electro-optical
    distance-ranging instrument (EODR), and for the subsequent compilation of tank
    capacity tables. Not applicable to the calibration of abnormally deformed tanks
    or of noncircular tanks. Applicable to tanks tilted by <= 3 % from the vertical,
    provided a correction is applied for the measured tilt. Applicable to tanks with
    cone-up or cone-down bottoms, as well as to tanks with flat bottoms.
