    ISO 20690:2018 provides requirements and recommendations for measuring the electricity consumption of small-format and wide-format digital production presses printing in different modes of operation. It is intended for use on equipment that has been declared by the manufacturer to be suitable for use as a digital production printing press.
    ISO 20690:2018 provides a means to compare the energy efficiency figures according to two or more characteristic machine combinations: Best Quality (BQ), Best Productivity (BP) or other combinations.
    ISO 20690:2018 is not suitable for determining the power consumption of individual device components such as servos, fans, compressors, control boards and so on. It excludes digital presses designed to print textiles intended for clothing or machines, which similarly depend on additional processes to produce the printed product, such as ceramics.
