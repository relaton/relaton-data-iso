  content: "This document identifies factors that affect the safety and performance
    of surgical implants due to the fact these implants are manufactured additively.\nThis
    document applies to non-active implants manufactured additively, including custom-made
    implants, and patient-matched implants.\nThis document also applies to instrumentation
    for use in association with non-active surgical implants manufactured by AM.\nWhile
    this document is not intended to apply to active implants, parts of the document
    can potentially still be used in the context of active implants.\nThis document
     identifies factors, which are either unique to additively manufactured implants
    or which require additional consideration for additively manufactured implants
    that might not be currently included within existing implant specific standards,
    which might have to be revised and updated. \nThis document does not apply to
    tissue-engineered implants manufactured by AM.\nNOTE 1 This document provides
    references to existing or currently developed relevant documents in ISO/TC 150,
    ISO/TC 261, ASTM F04 and ASTM F42.\nNOTE 2 Application of a quality management
    system, such as that described in ISO 13485, could be appropriate to help ensure
    that the implant achieves its intended performance."
