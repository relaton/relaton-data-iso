    ISO 12949:2011 provides a full-scale test method for determining the heat release rate and total heat release from a mattress or a mattress and foundation. The test specimen is ignited by exposure to a pair of gas burners that simulate burning bedclothes. The measurement capability is designed for mattress sets of low flammability, i.e. having a peak rate of heat release below 300 kW.
    ISO 12949:2011 applies to mattresses and mattress and foundation sets. ISO 12949:2011 does not apply to mattress pads, pillows, blankets, or other items used on top of a mattress.
    ISO 12949:2011 is a performance standard and does not prescribe the use of any specific components, fire retardant chemicals, or materials, and does not prescribe any design features that might lead to improved or degraded performance of a mattress set.
