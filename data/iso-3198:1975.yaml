  content: Applicable to products the content of which, expressed as sulphate, is
    equal or more than 5 mg/kg. The principle consists in the reduction of the sulphur
    compounds to hydrogen sulphide by heating with a mixture of hydriodic acid and
    hypophosphorous acid. Distillation of the hydrogen sulphide by a current of oxygen-free
    nitrogen in a mixture of sodium hydroxide and acetone. Titration of the sulphide
    with standard volumetric mercury(II) nitrate solution in the presence of dithizone
    as indicator.
