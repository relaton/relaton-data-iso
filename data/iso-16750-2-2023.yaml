    This document applies to electric and electronic systems/components for road vehicles. This document describes the potential environmental stresses and specifies tests and requirements for the specific mounting location on/in the road vehicle.
    This document describes electrical loads.
    This document is not intended to apply to environmental requirements or testing for systems and components of motorcycles and mopeds. Electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) is not covered by this document.
    Electrical loads are independent from the mounting location, but can vary due to the electrical impedance (including both the resistance and the inductance) in the vehicle wiring harness and connection system.
    Systems and their components released for production, or systems and their components already under development prior to the publication date of this document, can be exempted from fulfilling the changes in this edition compared to the previous one.
