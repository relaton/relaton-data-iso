    This document provides guidelines for the application of VSM with regard to the collection, evaluation and continuous improvement of value stream relevant data. In addition, it describes the assessment of value streams based on defined key performance indicators.
    The VSM method described in this document is generally applicable to material‑, energy- or data‑related process types. In practice, there are often hybrid forms of these main process types.
