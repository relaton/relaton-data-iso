  content: "Scope of the proposed deliverable.\nThis document defines requirements
    and message specifications for central ITS station (C-ITS-S) based positioning.
    \nThis document defines:\na) use-cases and requirements for central ITS station
    (C-ITS-S) based positioning\nb) message specifications for central ITS station
    (C-ITS-S) based positioning regarding with the defined use-cases and requirements.\n-
    The specifications include the data model and encoding of messages between personal/vehicle
    ITS stations(P/V-ITS-S) and the central ITS station (C-ITS-S) for the central
    ITS station(C-ITS-S) based positioning\n- The data model and encodings based on
    the defined message specifications include schema, data type, codelists and so
    on.\n         c) Also, some informative annexes for better understanding of the
