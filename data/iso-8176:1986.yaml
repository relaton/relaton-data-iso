abstract:
- content: 'The active TBC in a test portion is extracted by mixing with a solution
    containing m-nitrophpenol (as the internal standard) and evaporating the butadiene.
    The TBC and m-nitrophenol are separated by high-performance liquid chromatography
    and detected by UV: The peak areas or peak heights are measured and the TBC content
    is determined by using a calibration graph. The polymerization inhibitor TBC can
    also be determined by a spectrometric method (ISO 6684) but that method is not
    able to differentiate between the active inhibitor and its oxidized, inactive
    form. The present method specifically measures the concentration of the active
    form of TBC. The method is applicable to butadiene having TBC contents in the
    range 0 to 250 mg/kg.'
