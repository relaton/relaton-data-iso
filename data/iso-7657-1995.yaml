  content: Defines the conditions (materials, performance characteristics, temperature-related
    requirements) to be met for the flexible metal hoses, without coating (as defined
    in ISO 7369:1983, 4.1.10). The metal hoses defined are manufactured from helically
    wound preformed strip, generally with a right-hand lead where the turns, with
    or without packing, are connected together by single or double overlapping. Flexibility
    is achieved by adjacent turns sliding on each other.
