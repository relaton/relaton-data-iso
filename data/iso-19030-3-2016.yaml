abstract:
- content: |-
    ISO 19030-3:2016 outlines alternatives to the default method. Some will result in lower overall accuracy but increase applicability of the standard. Others can result in same or higher overall accuracy but includes elements which are not yet broadly used in commercial shipping.
    The general principles outlined and performance indicators defined are applicable to all ship types driven by conventional fixed pitch propellers, where the objective is to compare the hull and propeller performance of the same ship to itself over time.
    ISO 19030-3:2016 presents alternatives to measurement parameters (primary and then secondary) in Clause 4, then alternatives to measurement procedures (including alternative reference and evaluation periods) in Clause 5, describes the calculation of performance indicators in Clause 6, and finally the estimation of performance indicator accuracy in Clause 7. The structure used duplicates the structure of ISO 19030‑2 to facilitate cross-reference between the two documents.
    NOTE          Support for additional configurations (e.g. variable pitch propellers) will, if justified, be included in later revisions of this document.
