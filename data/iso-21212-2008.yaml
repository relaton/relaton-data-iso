abstract:
- content: "ISO 21212:2008 determines the air interface for second generation (2G)
    cellular networks and 2G systems (e.g. using WAP and I-Mode type protocols) to
    be compliant to CALM, i.e., requirements that must be met before a 2G system can
    be incorporated into a CALM system. In particular, it specifies protocols and
    parameters that 2G systems shall include to support prolonged, long-range, high
    data rate wireless communication links in ITS environments where heterogeneous
    handovers or media independent handovers (MIH) are either necessary to maintain
    the link, or desirable as determined by media selection policies.\nISO 21212:2008
    provides protocols and parameters for long range, medium speed wireless communications
    in the ITS sector using second generation cellular communications.\nWherever practicable,
    ISO 21212:2008 has been developed by reference to suitable extant standards, adopted
    by selection. Required regional variations are provided.  \nSpecifically, for
    ISO 21212:2008, extant 2G systems, as defined by various international and national
    standards, are adopted by reference.\nApplication-specific upper layers are not
    included in ISO 21212:2008, but will be driven by application standards (which
    may not be technology specific)."
