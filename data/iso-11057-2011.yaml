    ISO 11057:2011 specifies a standard reference test method for the comparative characterization of pulse-jet cleanable filter media, to be used in filter elements (e.g. bag filters, pocket filters, cartridge filters) applied in dry gas cleaning under standardized test conditions. The main purpose of testing is to gain information about both the operational performance and the particle emission of cleanable filter media.
    It should be noted that while one test apparatus and operating method has been chosen and described herein, it is recognized that other apparatus and operating arrangements can be found acceptable. In order for a candidate apparatus to become an equivalent apparatus, a comparison has to be performed with the standard reference apparatus according to a specified procedure. The test procedure, the characteristics of the required test facility, and the test conditions, as well as the evaluation and presentation of the results, are specified.
    The results obtained from this test method are not intended for prediction of the absolute performance of full-scale filter facilities. However, they are helpful for the selection and development of appropriate cleanable filter media and the identification of suitable operating parameters.
    Additional tasks such as verifying filter media concerning PM2,5 emissions, the classification of different media according to their filtration performance or the cleanability and durability of filter elements (i.e. projection of bag lifetime) can be addressed using the test method specified.
