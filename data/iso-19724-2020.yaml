    This document specifies cleanliness assessment procedures for evaluating the amount of debris present on the clean side of the constituent parts of high-pressure gasoline direct fuel injection systems. The presence of such debris could lead to a reduction in the system's operational performance.
    While other International Standards (e.g. ISO 16232) relate to the cleanliness of different types of components used in road vehicle fluid circuits, this document focuses on the special procedures applied for the components of gasoline direct fuel injection systems.
