abstract:
- content: "ISO 10418:2003 provides objectives, functional requirements and guidelines
    for techniques for the analysis, design and testing of surface process safety
    systems for offshore installations for the recovery of hydrocarbon resources.
    The basic concepts associated with the analysis and design of a process safety
    system for an offshore oil and gas production facility are described, together
    with examples of the application to typical (simple) process components. These
    examples are contained in the annexes of ISO 10418:2003.\nISO 10418:2003 is applicable
    to fixed offshore structures, floating production, storage and off-take systems
    for the petroleum and natural gas industries.\nISO 10418:2003 is not applicable
    to mobile offshore units and subsea installations, although many of the principles
    contained in it may be used as guidance. "
