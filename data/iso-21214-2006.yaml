  content: "ISO 21214:2006 determines the air interface using infra-red systems at
    820 nm to 1 010 nm. \nIt provides protocols and parameters for medium-range, medium-
    to high-speed wireless communications in the ITS sector using infra-red systems.\nSuch
    links are required for quasi-continuous, prolonged or short communications \n-
    between vehicles and the roadside, \n- between vehicles, and \n- between mobile
    equipment and fixed infrastructure points, \nover medium and long ranges.\nVehicles
    may be moving or stationary.\nWherever practicable, ISO 21214:2006 has been developed
    by reference to suitable extant International Standards, adopted by selection.
    Required regional variations are provided.\nDue account is given to, and use made
    of, any relevant parts of appropriate communications systems, such as global positioning
    systems (GPS), digital audio broadcasting (DAB), digital video broadcasting (DVB),
    radio local area networks (RLANs), digital data broadcasting (DDB), TETRA, FM
    subcarrier, mobile broadband systems (MBS, W-ATM), internet protocols, and dedicated
    short range communication (DSRC).\nISO 21214:2006\n- supports data rates of 1
    Mbit/s up to 128 Mbit/s (it may support higher data rates);\n- supports vehicle
    speeds up to a minimum of 200 km/h (closing speeds could be double this value);\n-
    defines or references environmental parameters relevant to link operation;\n-
    supports communication distances up to 100 m (it may support longer communication
    distances of 300 m to 1 000 m);\n- supports latencies and communication delays
    in the order of milliseconds;\n- is compliant to regional/national regulatory
    parameters;\n- may support other regional/national parameters as applicable.\nApplication-specific
    requirements are outside the scope of ISO 21214:2006. These requirements will
    be defined in the CALM management and upper layer standards and in application
    standards.\nApplication-specific upper layers are not included in ISO 21214:2006,
    but will be driven by application standards (which may not be technology specific)."
