  content: Specifies the materials, design, construction and properties of a test
    surface in order to minimize intersite variation in vehicle noise measurements.
    Has been developed particularly for use with the ISO 362 and ISO 7188; can be
    used for vehicle noise testing generally where it is desirable to achieve a low
    level of tyre/road noise during the test. Does not take into account the influence
    on tyre/road noise of purely tyre-related parameters.
