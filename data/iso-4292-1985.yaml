abstract:
- content: Determines the out-of-roundness by means of two-point measurement (measurement
    of diameters), by means of three-point measurement, summit (symmetrical or asymmetrical
    setting), and by means of three-point measurement, rider (symmetrical setting).
    Suitable for routine or in-process inspection because of the methods specified
    in ISO 4292 are faster and cheaper (than the procedure in ISO 4291).
