    This document specifies a test method based on a FZG four-square test machine to determine the relative load-carrying capacity of high EP oils defined by the gear surface damage known as scuffing. This test method is useful for evaluating the scuffing load capacity potential of oils typically used with highly stressed cylindrical gearing found in many vehicle and stationary applications. It is not suitable for establishing the scuffing load capacity potential of oils used in highly loaded hypoid bevel gearing applications, for which purpose other methods are available in the industry.
    NOTE            This method is technically equivalent to CEC L-84-02.
