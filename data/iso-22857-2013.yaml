abstract:
- content: |-
    ISO 22857:2013 provides guidance on data protection requirements to facilitate the transfer of personal health data across national or jurisdictional borders.
    It is normative only in respect of international or trans-jurisdictional exchange of personal health data. However it can be informative with respect to the protection of health information within national/jurisdictional boundaries and provide assistance to national or jurisdictional bodies involved in the development and implementation of data protection principles.
    ISO 22857:2013 covers both the data protection principles that apply to international or trans-jurisdictional transfers and the security policy which an organization adopts to ensure compliance with those principles.
    ISO 22857:2013 aims to facilitate international and trans-jurisdictional health-related applications involving the transfer of personal health data. It seeks to provide the means by which health data relating to data subjects, such as patients, will be adequately protected when sent to, and processed in, another country/jurisdiction.
