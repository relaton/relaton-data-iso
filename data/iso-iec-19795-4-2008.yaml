    ISO/IEC 19795-4:2008 prescribes methods for technology and scenario evaluations of multi-supplier biometric systems that use biometric data conforming to biometric data interchange format standards.
    It specifies requirements needed to assess
    - performance available from samples formatted according to a standard interchange format (SIF),
    - performance available when samples formatted according to a SIF are exchanged,
    - performance available from samples formatted according to a SIF, relative to proprietary data formats,
    - SIF interoperability by quantifying cross-product performance relative to single-product performance,
    - performance available from multi-sample and multimodal data formatted according to one or more SIFs, and
    - performance interoperability of biometric capture devices.
    In addition, ISO/IEC 19795-4:2008
    - includes procedures for establishing an interoperable set of implementations,
    - defines procedures for testing interoperability with previously established sets of implementations, and
    - gives testing procedures for the measurement of interoperable performance.
    It does not
    - establish a conformance test for biometric data interchange formats, or
    - provide test procedures for online data collection.
