    This document specifies an extraction method to determine the bioavailable (potential and environmental available) fraction and the non-bioavailable fraction of a contaminant in soil using a "receiver phase" for an organic contaminant with strong sorbing or complexing properties, for example, Tenax®[1] or cyclodextrin, respectively.
    NOTE 1    The bioavailable fraction is defined in ISO 17402 as environmental bioavailability.
    The method is applicable for non-polar organic contaminants with an aqueous solubility of <100 mg/l. The method is applicable for soil and soil-like material including (dredged) sediments.
    NOTE 2    The method is theoretically applicable to non-polar organic contaminants with an aqueous solubility of 1 000 mg/l. The method has been often applied for compounds with a much lower solubility (Kow > 3) and less for compounds with a higher solubility. The applicability is therefore defined for compounds with an aqueous solubility of <100 mg/l.
    [1] Tenax® is an example of a suitable product available commercially. This information is given for the convenience of users of this document and does not constitute an endorsement by ISO of this product.
