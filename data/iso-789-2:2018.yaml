    ISO 789-2:2018 specifies test procedures for determining the lifting capacity of rear-mounted three-point linkage systems:
    a)    the maximum vertical force which can be exerted by the hydraulic lift at the lower hitch points throughout their full range of movement;
    b)    the maximum vertical force which can be exerted by the hydraulic lift, at a point 610 mm to the rear of the hitch points on a frame attached to the three-point linkage, throughout its full range of movement.
    NOTE 1    A static test provides an adequate comparison between tractors. The test results are used only as a means of comparing tractors and not as a way of recommending the size of an implement which can be carried by the tractor.
    NOTE 2    This test procedure can be used to determine the lifting capacity of front-mounted three-point hitch systems.
