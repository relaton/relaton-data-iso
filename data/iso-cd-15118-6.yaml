    This part of this International Standard specifies the physical and data link layer for a wired high level
    communication between battery electric vehicles (BEV) or plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) , and the fixed electrical charging installation (Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE)) based on a differential version of the HomePlug Green PHY Power Line Communication.

    It covers the overall information exchange between all actors involved in the electrical energy exchange. This International Standard is applicable for (manually) connected conductive charging via charging connectors that use dedicated communication pins.
