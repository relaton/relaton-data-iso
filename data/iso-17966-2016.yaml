    ISO 17966:2016 specifies requirements and associated test methods for assistive products for personal hygiene (APPHs) that support users and which are intended by the manufacturer to alleviate or compensate for disability. The work environment and safety aspects for assistants are also included. It specifies safety and performance requirements that apply during normal use and foreseeable misuse and failure. It also specifies methods of measurement of the forces necessary to operate controls and specifies limits on the forces needed for some operations.
    This International Standard specifies requirements and test methods for assistive products within the following divisions of ISO 9999:2011:
    09 12 03      Commode chairs;
    NOTE          This covers mobile and static products.
    09 12 06      Toilets with built in raising and height adjustable mechanism;
    NOTE          This excludes toilets with built-in douche and air dryers.
    09 12 09      Toilet seats;
    09 12 12      Raised toilet seats mounted on frame;

    09 12 18      Raised toilet seats fixed to toilet;
    09 12 21      Toilet seats with built-in raising mechanism to help standing up and sitting down;
    09 12 24      Toilet arm supports and toilet back supports mounted on toilet;
    09 12 25      Toilet arm supports and toilet back supports, free standing;

    18 15 06      Height adjustable plinths and brackets;
    NOTE          Refers to height adjustable plinths and brackets when used as an assistive product for personal hygiene (APPH). Height adjustable mechanisms for other items such as basins may be included.
    18 18 03      Handrails and support rails;
    18 18 06      Fixed grab bars and handgrips;

    18 18 11      Hinged rails and arm supports;
