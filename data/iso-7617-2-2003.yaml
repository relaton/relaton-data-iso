abstract:
- content: ISO 7617-2:2003 specifies requirements for coated fabrics for upholstered
    furniture, manufactured by applying to one side of a woven cloth a substantially
    continuous coating of a suitably plasticized polymer of vinyl chloride, or a copolymer
    the major constituent of which is vinyl chloride. Such coatings are known as poly(vinyl
    chloride) (PVC) coatings. The present specification covers two grades (A and B)
    of PVC-coated woven fabric.
