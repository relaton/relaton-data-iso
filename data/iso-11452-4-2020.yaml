abstract:
- content: |-
    This document specifies harness excitation test methods and procedures for determining the immunity of electronic components of passenger cars and commercial vehicles regardless of the propulsion system (e.g. spark-ignition engine, diesel engine, electric motor).
    The bulk current injection (BCI) test method is based on current injection into the wiring harness using a current probe as a transformer where the harness forms the secondary winding.
    The tubular wave coupler (TWC) test method is based on a wave coupling into the wiring harness using the directional coupler principle. The TWC test method was developed for immunity testing of automotive components with respect to radiated disturbances in the GHz ranges (GSM bands, UMTS, ISM 2,4 GHz). It is best suited to small (with respect to wavelength) and shielded device under test (DUT), since in these cases the dominating coupling mechanism is via the harness.
    The electromagnetic disturbances considered in this document are limited to continuous narrowband electromagnetic fields.
