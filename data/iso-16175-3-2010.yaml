  content: "ISO 16175-3:2010 specifies general requirements and guidelines for records
    management and gives guidelines for the appropriate identification and management
    of evidence (records) of business activities transacted through business systems.
    It gives guidelines \n- to understand processes and requirements for identifying
    and managing records in business systems;\n- to develop requirements for functionality
    for records to be included in a design specification when building, upgrading
    or purchasing business system software;\n- to evaluate the records management
    capability of proposed customized or commercial off-the-shelf business system
    software; \n- to review the functionality for records or assess compliance of
    existing business systems.\nISO 16175-3:2010 specifies requirements for export
    supports preservation by allowing the export of records to a system that is capable
    of long-term preservation activities, or for the ongoing migration of records
    into new systems. It does not specify requirements for the long-term preservation
    of digital records. \nISO 16175-3:2010 is not applicable to records management
    in highly integrated software environments based on service-oriented architectures.\nISO
    16175-3:2010 does not specify a general system management, nor the design requirements
    such as usability, reporting, searching, system administration and performance.
    It also does not specify developing design specifications, procurement and evaluation
    processes in any detail."
