abstract:
- content: "In this document, a workflow that includes experimental procedures and
    flaw (imperfection) detection algorithms to identify the location of flaws created
    during the powder bed fusion-laser-based (PBF-LB) process of metals is explained.
    These flaws may have detrimental effects on the printed part mechanical performance.
    \nIn this practice, only guidelines and workflow for coaxial photodiode-based
    in-situ monitoring as well as the associated statistical and machine learning
    flaw detection algorithms are provided. \nThis practice does not address the security
    risks associated with manufacturing and environmental information. It is the responsibility
    of the user to follow practices and establish appropriate information technology
    related security measures.\nWARNING - This standard does not purport to address
    all of the safety concerns, if any, associated with its use. It is the responsibility
    of the user of this standard to establish appropriate safety, health, and environmental
    practices and determine the applicability of regulatory limitations prior to use."
