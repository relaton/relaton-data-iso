abstract:
- content: This document specifies the test method for the determination of adhesive
    fracture energy of adhesively bonded plates of carbon fibre reinforced plastic
    (CFRP) and metal using a double cantilever beam (DCB) specimen. The test method
    is also applicable to bonded joints between metals and other composite materials,
    such as glass fibre reinforced plastics.
