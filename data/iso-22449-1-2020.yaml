    This document defines terms related to industrial cooling water systems and specifies technical guidelines for the use of reclaimed water for make-up water purposes water in industrial cooling systems. It provides a basic framework for consideration in the design and operation of industrial cooling systems using reclaimed water. The aim of the document is to promote and to help the implementation of the use of reclaimed water in industrial cooling systems.
    It provides:
    —     Terms and definitions;
    —     Technical guidelines for the use of reclaimed water in industrial cooling systems.
    This document is applicable to cooling systems that are considered to work as auxiliary systems for the normal operation of an industrial process. However, the operation of a cooling system in relation to process safety is not covered in this document. In addition, some environmental concerns also need to be taken into consideration, for example the drift control or the use of some persistent biocides. This document can be used to encourage consistency within any organization engaged in the use of reclaimed water.
