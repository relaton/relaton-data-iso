    This document sets out minimum performance requirements for station uniforms for firefighters that are provided by agencies to be worn under primary protective garments compliant with the relevant standards.
    NOTE    A station uniform, as defined by this document, is understood to not be a formal uniform or parade uniform, which are not likely to be worn under primary protective firefighting garments.
    Garments developed in accordance with this document complement the performance built into primary protection firefighting garments in terms of minimising impact on hindrance, metabolic heat and comfort.
    This document specifies two levels of requirements for station uniforms:
    —          Level 1 specifies minimum no melting nor dripping requirements that provide no additional protection but ensure the firefighter is not harmed by the melting of station uniform materials in cases where heat or flames impinge the station uniform.
    —          Level 2 specifies heat and flame requirements to provide minimum protection. It can be combined with additional layers or garments to meet the requirements of a standard for a specific primary protection garment, this combination should provide improved protection and comfort.
