    This document describes a procedure for the identification of single fish and fish fillets to the
    level of genus or species.
    The identification of fish species is carried out by PCR amplification of either a segment of the
    mitochondrial cytochrome b gene (cytb) [1] or the cytochrome c oxidase I gene (cox1, syn COI)
    [2], [3] or both, followed by sequencing of the PCR products and subsequent sequence
    comparison with entries in databases [4], [5]. The methodology allows the identification of a large
    number of commercially important fish species.
    The decision whether the cytb or cox1 gene segment or both are used for fish identification
    depends on the declared fish species, the applicability of the PCR method for the fish species
    and the availability of comparative sequences in the public databases.
    This method has been successfully validated on raw fish fillets, however, laboratory experience
    is available that it can also be applied to processed, e.g. cold smoked, hot smoked, salted,
    frozen, cooked, fried, deep fried
    samples.
    This document is usually unsuitable for the analysis of highly processed foods, e.g. tins of fish,
    with highly degraded DNA where the fragment lengths are not sufficient for amplification of the
    targets. Furthermore, it is not applicable for complex fish products containing mixtures of two or
    more fish species.
