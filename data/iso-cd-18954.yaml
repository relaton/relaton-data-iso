abstract:
- content: "This test method is to be used only if no rules and parameters for tightening
    exist, e.g. for pretensioning of stainless steel bolting assemblies, or when bolts
    are pretensioned by turning the head.\n\nThis test method establishes a bolt tightening
    qualification procedure (BTQP) which provides design and execution rules for pretensioning
    of stainless steel and carbon steel bolting assemblies with bolting assemblies
    consisting of one bolt, one nut, and washers as required for the installation
    method. \n\nThe test method allows the determination of the tightening parameters
    for a specific configuration. In this procedure, one configuration is:\n- One
    single bolting assembly lot (i.e. bolts from one manufacturing lot, nuts from
    one\nmanufacturing lot, washers from one manufacturing lot, \n- One lubrication,
    and \n- One tightening method, with a defined pretension level.\n\nTesting should
    be performed for each new configuration. The specified pretension shall not exceed
    the nominal pretension level.\n\nThe test method includes:\n— the definition of
    appropriate lubrication to ensure a sufficiently long plastic plateau of the bolt
    force–rotation curve. (The ability to demonstrate the required functional characteristics
    of the bolting assembly is highly dependent on the type of lubrication used.)\n—
    the evaluation of tightening parameters.\n— a suitability test to confirm that
    the required pretension can be reliably obtained by a specific\ntightening method
    with a sufficient margin of safety against overtightening.\n\nThis test methods
    applies only to static design. Fatigue considerations may govern the design should
    also be assessed."
