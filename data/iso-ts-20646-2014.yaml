  content: ISO/TS 20646:2014 provides information and guidelines to properly utilize
    various ergonomics standards concerning the factors related to musculoskeletal
    workload (MSWL), and helps develop activities to reduce or optimize MSWL in workplaces
    and non-professional activities, in an effective and efficient manner. The activities
    are intended to be based on a risk assessment. ISO/TS 20646:2014 is intended primarily
    for employers, ergonomics and occupational health-related staff and workers in
    enterprises, and workers. Prevention of MSWL is not always a matter of reducing
    the load. The approach to reducing MSWL also involves assessing the work environment
    and organization as a system to identify how changes can help to safely manage
    MSWL. Although it provides ideas of effective and efficient measures to reduce
    or optimize MSWL, ISO/TS 20646:2014 does not certify the complete prevention of
    health problems caused by MSWL.
