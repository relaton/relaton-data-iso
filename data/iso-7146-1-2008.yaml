    ISO 7146-1:2008 defines, describes and classifies the characteristics of damage occurring in service to hydrodynamically lubricated metallic plain bearings and journals. It assists in the understanding of the various characteristics of damage which may occur.
    Consideration is restricted to damage characteristics which have a well-defined appearance and which can be attributed to particular damage causes with a high degree of certainty. Various appearances are illustrated with photographs and diagrams.
