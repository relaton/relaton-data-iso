  content: "ISO 24102:2010 provides specifications for intelligent transport systems
    (ITS) station management to be compliant with the ITS station reference architecture
    and the set of communications access for land mobiles (CALM) related standards.
    \nManagement actions are specified via service access points; messages and data
    that flow between the ITS station management entity and the security entity, the
    application entity and the various communication protocol layers of the ITS station
    reference architecture; and protocol data units for management communications
    between addressable instances of functionality of an ITS station. "
