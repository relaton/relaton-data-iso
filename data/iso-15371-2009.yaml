abstract:
- content: "ISO 15371:2009 applies to the design, testing, and operation of pre-engineered
    fire extinguishing systems to protect the galley hoods, ducts, fryers and other
    grease laden appliances. \nPre-engineered fire-extinguishing system units are
    also required to comply with requirements for the construction and components
    performance as applicable to specific types, designs, sizes and arrangements.
    ISO 15371:2009 also provides minimum requirements for the testing and evaluation
    of components.\nA product that contains features, characteristics, components,
    materials or systems that are new or different from those covered by the requirements
    in ISO 15371:2009 and that involve a risk of fire, electric shock, or injury to
    persons, shall be evaluated using the appropriate additional component and end-product
    testing."
