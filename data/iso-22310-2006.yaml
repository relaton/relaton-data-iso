abstract:
- content: |-
    ISO 22310:2006 allows the appropriate incorporation of records requirements, according to ISO 15489-1, ISO/TR 15489-2 and 23081-1, which are applicable to all standards that require the creation and retention of records, into other standards. It also highlights the different elements that need to be considered as components of a comprehensive records management framework.
    This guidance is in addition to the procedures for technical work and the methodology for the development of International Standards established by the ISO/IEC Directives.
    ISO 22310:2006 is intended for use by all ISO bodies involved in the development of records management or documentation requirements in standards. It can also be used by non-ISO standards development organizations at the international, regional or national level, which are considering or are in the process of developing records management requirements in standards and/or comparable documents.
