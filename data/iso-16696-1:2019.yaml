    This document establishes the basic principles for component performance and minimum production requirements for cross laminated timber (CLT). This document also contains scheme requirements for conformance, as provided in Annex D.
    The document is applicable to CLT products which are manufactured from solid-sawn timber or wood based panels built up of at least three layers in which the grain of adjoining layers are at right angles to each other.
    This document provides CLT dimension tolerances; component requirements; performance criteria; production, testing and trade marking guidance; and minimum requirements for factory production control. This document is based on known species, species combination and/or wood based panel structural performance and bondability.
    CLT qualified in accordance with the provisions of this document are intended to resist the effects of moisture on structural performance as can occur due to construction delays or other conditions of similar severity.
    NOTE       This document does not include how CLT is to be used and installed, as it will be detailed in ISO 16696-2.
