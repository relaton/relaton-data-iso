  content: ISO 19106:2004 is intended to define the concept of a profile of the ISO
    geographic information standards developed by ISO/TC 211 and to provide guidance
    for the creation of such profiles. Only those components of specifications that
    meet the definition of a profile contained herein can be established and managed
    through the mechanisms described in this International Standard. These profiles
    can be standardized internationally using the ISO standardization process. This
    document also provides guidance for establishing, managing, and standardizing
    at the national level (or in some other forum).
