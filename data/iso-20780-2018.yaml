abstract:
- content: This document specifies requirements for the design and verification of
    fibre optic components used in space fibre optic sub-systems. In this document,
    the requirements are established to assure the reliability and environmental adaptability
    of fibre optic components in space environmental conditions. These are in a range
    of applications such as ground systems, unmanned applications and manned systems.
    This document suggests a set of requirements to be applied to the selection of
    space fibre optic components.
