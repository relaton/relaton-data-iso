    This document describes an analytical method to determine the emissions from non-metallic materials used for moulded parts in motor vehicles, such as textiles, carpets, adhesives, sealing compounds, forms, leather, plastic parts, films and sheets, paints or material combinations.
    The materials are characterized in terms of the type and quantity of organic substances that can be outgassed from them. For this purpose, two semiquantitative sum values are determined, which allow an estimation of the emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOC value) and the proportion of condensable substances [low volatile “fogging” compound (FOG) value]. Furthermore, individual substances of the emission are determined. During the analysis, the samples are thermally extracted, the emissions are separated by gas chromatography and detected by mass spectrometry. The test method presented in this document provides values that are valid only for conditions described in this document.
    The results which can be achieved using this method are not appropriate for making further estimations of any kind of the health effects of emitted substances nor should they be used might that can be found in the interior of a complete vehicle in stationary condition, while driving or in conditions similar to driving.
