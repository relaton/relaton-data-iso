- content: This part lays down the nominal dimensions relating to seals suitable for
    shafts from 6 to 400 mm diameter and accompanying housings from 16 to 440 mm.
    Seals of this type are not normally suitable for high pressure. Includes dimensional
    limits for the shafts and housings to assure interchangeability of seals from
    different manufacturers. The six basic types of seals are described and shown
    in figure 1. The annex includes a recommended form for reaching agreement between
    purchaser and manufacturer.
