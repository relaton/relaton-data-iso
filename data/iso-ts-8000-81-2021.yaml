    This document specifies a procedure for data profiling to generate the foundation for performing data quality assessment. This profiling is applicable to data sets that are either originally in a structure of tables and columns or are the output from a transformation to create such a structure.
    NOTE 1    Data profiling is applicable to all types of database technology.
    The following are within the scope of this document:
    —    performing structure analysis to determine data element concepts;
    —    performing column analysis to identify relevant data elements, including statistics about a data set;
    —    performing relationship analysis to identify dependencies in a data set.
    The following are outside the scope of this document:
    —    methods for extracting and sampling data to be profiled from a data set;
    —    deriving data rules;
    —    measuring the extent of nonconformities in a data set.
    NOTE 2    ISO 8000‑8 specifies approaches to measuring data and information quality.
    This document can be used in conjunction with, or independently of, quality management systems standards.
