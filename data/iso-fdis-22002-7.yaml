    This document specifies requirements for establishing, implementing and maintaining prerequisite programmes (PRP) to assist in controlling food safety hazards.

    This document is applicable to all organizations, regardless of size or complexity, which are involved in the retail step of the food chain and wish to implement PRP in such a way as to address the requirements specified in ISO 22000:2018, Clause8.

    This document is neither designed nor intended for use in other parts of the food supply chain.
    Food retail operations are diverse in nature and not all of the requirements specified in this document apply to an individual establishment or process.

    Where exclusions are made or alternative measures implemented, these need to be justified and documented by a hazard analysis, as described in ISO 22000:2018, 8.5.2. Any exclusions or alternative measures adopted should not affect the ability of the organization to comply with these requirements. Examples of such exclusions include the additional aspects relevant to manufacturing operations listed under 1), 2), 3), 4), and 5) below.

    This document specifies detailed requirements to be specifically considered in relation to ISO  22000:2018, 8.2.4: to be discussed in conjunction with doc 100

    a) construction and layout of buildings and associated utilities;
    b) layout of premises, including workspace and employee facilities;
    c) supplies of air, water, energy and other utilities;
    d) supporting services, including waste and sewage disposal;
    e) suitability of equipment and its accessibility for cleaning, maintenance and preventive   maintenance;
    f) management of purchased materials;
    g) measures for the prevention of cross-contamination;
    h) cleaning and sanitizing;
    i) pest control;
    j) personnel hygiene.
