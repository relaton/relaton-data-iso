    This document sets out the minimum requirements for flight safety systems (FSSs), including flight termination systems (FTSs, externally controlled systems or on-board automatic systems), tracking systems, and telemetry data transmitting systems (TDTSs) for commercial or non-commercial launch activities of orbital or suborbital, unmanned space vehicles. The intent is to minimize the risk of injury or damage to persons, property or the environment resulting from the launching of space vehicles.
    This document can be applied by any country, by any international organization, whether intergovernmental or not, and by any agency or operator undertaking the launching of space vehicles.
    This document is intended to be applied by any person, organization, entity, operator or launch authority participating in commercial or non-commercial launch activities of orbital, or suborbital, unmanned space vehicles unless more restrictive requirements are imposed by the launch site country.
