abstract:
- content: Applicable to products having contents, expressed as chlorine, between
    2 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg. For contents exceeding 50mg/kg the method specified in ISO
    992 shall be used. The principle consists in quantitative displacement of the
    thiocyanate (SCN- ) ions of the mercury(II) thiocyanate by the cloride (Cl- )
    ions contained in the test portion. Reaction of the thiocyanate ions with iron(III)
    nitrate to form iron(III) thiocyanate (red). Photometric measurement of the colour
    at a wavelength of about 450 nm.
