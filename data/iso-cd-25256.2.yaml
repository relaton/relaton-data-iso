    This ISO Standard applies to surface cleaning machines for outdoor applications in public areas, roads, airports and industrial complexes. Surface cleaning machines in terms of this standard, are self-propelled, truck mounted, attached sweeping equipment or pedestrian controlled.
    This ISO Standard deals with the performance and functional characteristics and the test methods applied to the sweeping equipment when used as intended and under the conditions foreseen by the manufacturer.
    This ISO Standard does not include carrier vehicles (e.g. trucks). These are covered in national standards or directives for vehicles.
    This ISO Standard does not cover noise emission or any overload protection as these are covered by regulatory requirements.
    This document does not apply to:
    — cleaning machines for winter maintenance;
    — cleaning machines for indoor applications;
    — front mounted road cleaning attachments which can be coupled to tractors and other machinery;
    — machines or components that are specifically;
    — designed for cleaning tram lines and rail tracks;
    — industrial sweepers.
