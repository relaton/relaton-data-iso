    This document provides information based on a study of the characteristics of head-mounted displays (HMDs) regarding the ergonomics of human–system interaction. Although this document covers the broad range of ergonomics issues that arise, it specifically provides more-detailed information about the visual aspects of the interaction, and it provides information that could form the basis for future possible standards related to HMDs.
    NOTE: It is preferable to take systematic approach to consider characteristics of HMD, since HMD affects a viewer not only by visual aspects, but also by some other physical aspects.
