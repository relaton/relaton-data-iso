    This document specifies software programming language vulnerabilities to be avoided in the development of systems where assured behaviour is required for security, safety, mission-critical and business-critical software. Language-specific descriptions of these vulnerabilities are provided in other parts of the ISO/IEC 24772 series.
    It is applicable to the software developed, reviewed, or maintained for any application.
    This document does not address software engineering and management issues such as how to design and implement programs, use configuration management tools, use managerial processes, and perform process improvement. Furthermore, the specification of properties and applications to be assured are not treated.
    Vulnerabilities are described in a generic manner that is applicable to a broad range of programming languages.
