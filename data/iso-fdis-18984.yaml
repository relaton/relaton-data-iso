abstract:
- content: "This document is applicable to two-way or multi-way ball valves manufactured
    with all types of polypropylene (PP) and chlorinated polyvinylchloride (PVC-C)
    thermoplastic materials to be used for the transport of pressurized water whether
    or not intended for human consumption (domestic systems) for applications in buildings
    and utility branches.\nNOTE 1 The two-way valve is generally used for sectioning
    and control of flows, and the multi-way valve is used to divert or mix the flows.
    For information on their functionality, see ISO 16135:2006, Annex B.\nNOTE 2   
    The reader of this document is informed that the water intended for human consumption
    is subjected to national, regional or local regulatory provisions as applicable.\nThe
    application classes are indicated in ISO 15874 and ISO 15877 series.\nThis document
    specifies valve characteristics as follows:\n- dimensions for assembly in the
    relevant pipelines,   \n- physical and mechanical requirements.\n \nOther materials
    can fit the scope of this document if the application classes are specified in
    a material related specific standard \nBall valves specified in this document
    are not intended to be used in conjunction with pipes made by metallic material
    and copper alloys"
