  content: "This part of ISO 16063 specifies the instrumentation and procedures to
    be used for primary calibration of accelerometers using the reciprocity method
    and the SI system of units.\nIt is applicable to the calibration of rectilinear
    accelerometers over a frequency range of 40 Hz to 5 kHz and a frequency-dependent
    amplitude range of 10 m/s2 to 100 m/s 2 and is based on the use of the coil of
    an electrodynamic vibrator as the reciprocal transducer. \nCalibration of the
    sensitivity of a transducer can be obtained using this part of ISO 16063 provided
    that the signal conditioner or amplifier used with the transducer during calibration
    has been adequately characterized. In order to achieve these measurement uncertainties,
    it has been assumed that the transducer has been calibrated in combination with
    its signal conditioner or amplifier (the combination of which in this part of
    ISO 16063 is referred to as the accelerometer)."
