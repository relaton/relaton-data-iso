  content: ISO/TR 11371:2013 gives guidelines for the laboratory refining of various
    pulps intended for paper production including unifying terms and parameters for
    the simulation of industrial refining processes and laboratory refiners; treating
    pulp samples in a (semi) continuous operation in contrast to quasi-stationary
    laboratory beating equipment such as the PFI mill or Valley Hollander; evaluation
    of chemical market pulps under close-to-reality conditions in terms of refining
    intensity and refining energy consumption; optimizing of fibre furnishes in terms
    of cost, quality, and energy requirements; and      this Technical Report only
    considers refiners operating at low consistency.
