- content: |-
    This document provides guidance for drawing regional atmospheric corrosion maps by using detailed corrosion measurements and sub-sequent interpolation of measured corrosion values, and introduces the principles for the revision of atmospheric corrosion maps, as well as the selection of background stations and test stations.

    This document is applicable to drawing regional atmospheric corrosion maps, which provides the basis for the site selection, material selection, structural design, and corrosion protection of engineering construction.
