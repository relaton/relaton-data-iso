abstract:
- content: These tests are intended to ensure that the penetrant system works correctly
    and that there has been no harmful deterioration of the process materials during
    service. Generally, the frequency of checking penetrant materials and black light
    sources will depend on the frequency and conditions of usage. Specific and maximum
    intervals should be recommended by the manufacturer.
