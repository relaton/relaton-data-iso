    This document provides a calculation method for bevel and hypoid gears regarding scuffing based on experimental and theoretical investigation[7]. This calculation method is a flash temperature method.
    The formulae in this document are intended to establish uniformly acceptable methods for calculating scuffing resistance of straight, helical (skew), spiral bevel, Zerol and hypoid gears made of steel. They are applicable equally to tapered depth and uniform depth teeth. Hereinafter, the term “bevel gear” refers to all of these gear types; if not the case, the specific forms are identified.
    A calculation method of the scuffing load capacity of bevel and hypoid gears based on an integral temperature method is not available when this document is published.
    The formulae in this document are based on virtual cylindrical gears and restricted to bevel gears whose virtual cylindrical gears have transverse contact ratios of εvα < 2. The results are valid within the range of the applied factors as specified in ISO 10300‑1 (see ISO 6336‑2). Additionally, the given relations are valid for bevel gears of which the sum of profile shift coefficients of pinion and wheel is zero (see ISO 23509).
