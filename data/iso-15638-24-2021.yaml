    The ISO 15638 series (Parts 1 to 23) define the framework for online fleet management of regulated commercial freight vehicles utilizing data communication between in-vehicle systems and an application service provider via an on-board communication unit interfacing with road monitoring infrastructure and roadside sensors. This document defines an unregulated service architecture framework for freight vehicle safety information provision architecture. This statement does not preclude the regulated service where a jurisdiction requires such a function.
    The objective of this document is to provide a freight vehicle safety information provision service function/application for non-enforcement applications (and sometimes for regulated application services [RAS]). This is for the road transport safety management purposes of regulated commercial freight vehicle movements.
    This document intends to reinforce vehicle safety for non-enforcement and other purposes by providing safety advisory information provisions to the freight vehicle drivers/operators transporting heavy goods on freight vehicles.
    This document defines the framework for remote vehicle safety information provision for non-enforcement and the conceptual operation of other management purpose applications.
    This document is complementary to, and does not replace, any other documents in the ISO 15638 series. This document is beneficial to vehicle safety management purpose entities and it provides additional use cases for TARV service applications.
    This document is specifically oriented towards the realization of safer road transport of freight vehicles by providing safety advisory information to the vehicle from the service provider. It utilizes the ISO 15638 series basic architecture framework, as defined in ISO 15638-21. The service provider provides users with safety information such as recommended safety information for that vehicle and gives adequate safety advice messages, as necessary. The various V2X communication paths can be used according to the various use cases.
