  script: Latn
  content: ISO 22179:2009 contains the basic control strategy, minimum functionality
    requirements, basic driver interface elements, minimum requirements for diagnostics
    and reaction to failure, and performance test procedures for full speed range
    adaptive cruise control (FSRA) systems. FSRA is fundamentally intended to provide
    longitudinal control of equipped vehicles while travelling on highways (roads
    where non-motorized vehicles and pedestrians are prohibited) under free-flowing
    and congested traffic conditions. FSRA provides support within the speed domain
    of standstill up to the designed maximum speed of the system. The system will
    attempt to stop behind an already tracked vehicle within its limited deceleration
    capabilities and will be able to start again after the driver has input a request
    to the system to resume the journey from standstill. The system is not required
    to react to stationary or slow moving objects {in accordance with ISO 15622 [adaptive
    cruise control (ACC)]}.
