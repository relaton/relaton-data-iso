abstract:
- content: Is applicable to raw, pasteurized UHT-treated or sterilized whole milk,
    partly skimmed and skimmed milk. The principle consists in supercooling a test
    portion of the milk to the appropriate temperature, depending on the instrument,
    and inducing the crystallizatin by mechanical vibration which causes the temperature
    to rise quickly to a level which corresponds to the freezing point ot the test
    portion. Annex A specifies the means of duplicate values of freezing points while
    indications as to the relationship between freezing points expresses in degrees
    Celsius and degrees Celsius as measured in the Horvet apparatus are given in Annex
    B.
