    This document provides definitions, symbols and injury probability functions (IPFs) for the thigh, leg and knee intended to be used with the advanced pedestrian legform impactor (aPLI), a standardized pedestrian legform impactor with an upper mass for pedestrian subsystem testing of road vehicles. They are applicable to impact tests using the aPLI at 11,1 m/s involving:
    —    vehicles of category M1, except vehicles with a maximum mass above 2 500 kg and which are derived from N1 category vehicles and where the driver’s position, the R-point, is either forward of the front axle or longitudinally rearwards of the front axle transverse centreline by a maximum of 1 100 mm;
    —    vehicles of category N1, except where the driver’s position, the R-point, is either forward of the front axle or longitudinally rearwards of the front axle transverse centreline by maximum of 1 100 mm;
    —    impacts to the bumper test area defined by References [1] and [2];
    —    pedestrian subsystem tests involving use of a legform for the purpose of evaluating compliance with vehicle safety standards.
