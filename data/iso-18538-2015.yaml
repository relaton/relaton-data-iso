  content: ISO 18538:2015 specifies the information to be recorded in farmed molluscs
    supply chains (excluding cephalopods) in order to establish the traceability of
    products originating from farm-raised molluscs. It specifies how molluscan products
    traded are to be identified and the information to be generated and held on those
    products by each of the food businesses that physically trade them through the
    distribution chains. It is specific to the distribution for human consumption
    of molluscs and their products from farm through to retailers or caterers.
