  content: "This Technical Specification will provide a definition, a conceptual framework
    and a categorisation framework for non-acoustic factors (sometimes also referred
    to as “contextual factors”). These factors have a material influence on the measurement,
    reporting and assessment of self-reported health outcomes attributable to noise
    and soundscape studies, as well as on the planning, design and management of soundscape
    and noise interventions.\n\nIf Part I is adopted, the following parts would be
    proposed to complete the standard series:\n– \tPart 2: Data collection and reporting\n–
    \tPart 3: Data analysis\n– \tPart 4: Interpretation"
