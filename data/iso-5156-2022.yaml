    This document specifies a method for testing the corrosivity of disinfectants against metals and alloys (for example, apparatus, reagents and materials, test specimens, pre-cleaning of test specimens, conditioning, procedure, test report) under total immersion conditions.
    This document is applicable to the determination of corrosion of disinfectants to metal materials under total immersion. Other corrosion test methods are not included in this document, and this document does not include the evaluation of corrosion test results.
    This document does not purport to address all of the safety concerns, if any, associated with its use. It is the responsibility for the user of this document to establish appropriate safety and health practices and determine the applicability of regulatory limitations prior to use.
