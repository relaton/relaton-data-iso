- content: "ISO 20022-7:2013 specifies the responsibilities of the following bodies,
    which are involved in the registration and maintenance of the ISO 20022 Repository.
    \n-        The Registration Authority (RA) is the operating authority responsible
    for the registration and maintenance of the ISO 20022 Repository and for providing
    access to the information described in ISO 20022-1:2013. The RA is assisted by
    different Standards Evaluation Groups (SEG), i.e. groups of industry experts responsible
    for specific Business Areas of the Repository. \n-        A Technical Support
    Group (TSG) advises the SEGs, the RA, developers and communities of users on the
    technical implementation of ISO 20022. \n-        The Registration Management
    Group (RMG) is the governing body of the overall registration process and the
    appeal body for the communities of users, Submitting Organisations, the RA, the
    SEGs and the TSG. It monitors the registration process performance."
