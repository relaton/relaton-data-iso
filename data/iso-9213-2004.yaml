    ISO 9213:2004 specifies procedures for the establishment and operation of a gauging station, equipped with an electromagnetic flow meter, in an open channel or a closed conduit with a free water surface.
    ISO 9213:2004 is applicable to configurations where an artificial magnetic field is generated through which the entire body of water flows. The induced voltage is sensed in such a way that all elements of the moving water contribute. The equipment described normally requires an electrical mains power supply.
    ISO 9213:2004 is not applicable to devices sampling only part of the flowing body of water (e.g. velocity meters) or to flow meters which operate by using the Earth's magnetic field.
