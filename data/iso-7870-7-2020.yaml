  content: |-
    This document describes the construction and use of multivariate control charts in statistical process control (SPC) and establishes methods for using and understanding this generalized approach to control charts where the characteristics being measured are from variables data.
    The use of principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares (PLS) in the field of multivariate statistical process control is not presented in this document
    NOTE    The document describes the current state of the art of multivariate control charts that are being applied in practice nowadays. It does not describe the current state of scientific research on the topic.
