  content: This document defines terms and specifies test methods and general performance
    requirements for single-pole and multi-pole connections used with on-board electrical
    wiring harnesses of road vehicles. This document is applicable to connectors designed
    to be disconnected after mounting in the vehicle for repair and maintenance only.
    It does not cover one-part connections, i.e. where one part of the connection
    has direct contact to the pattern of the printed circuit board. This document
    is not applicable to internal connections of electronic devices.
