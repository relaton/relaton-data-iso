  content: |-
    This document presents the framework and general principles for maintenance and repair of all kinds of existing concrete structures — un-reinforced and reinforced concrete, prestressed concrete and steel-concrete composite structures, or their structural members.
    In this document, deterioration is clearly distinguished from damage occurring in a short period and not developing over subsequent time, such as cracking and scaling due to earthquakes or impact loading, etc. Deterioration is mainly dealt with as a target for the maintenance activities.
    This document also provides the basic concept of repair carried out to restore structural performance of existing structures.
    This document does not cover those aspects of maintenance and repair that are related to serviceability and aesthetics without direct impact on durability and service life, e.g. cleaning of drains, removal of vegetation, refreshment of paint, etc.
    This document also does not cover repair of defects during execution of new structures.
