- content: |-
    This document specifies safety, constructional, and performance and testing requirements for thermoelectric flame supervision controls, energized by a thermocouple, intended for use with gas burners and gas-burning appliances, hereafter referred to as “controls”.
    This document applies to thermoelectric flame supervision controls for gas burners and gas-burning appliances of nominal connection size up to, and including DN 50, that can be used and tested independently of these appliances.
    These thermoelectric flame supervision controls are suitable for fuel gases, such as natural gas, manufactured gas or liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) at inlet pressures up to and including 50 kPa. It is not applicable to corrosive and waste gases.
    This document covers type testing only.
    This document is not applicable to:
    a) the thermocouple; and
    b) controls which use auxiliary energy (e.g. electrical energy supplied externally).
