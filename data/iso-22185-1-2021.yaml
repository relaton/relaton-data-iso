    This document defines moisture damage and it specifies the moisture sources and the moisture transport mechanisms in buildings.
    It includes a method for classification of moisture damage based on the relation of:
    —     materials and constituent materials,
    —     phenomena, and
    —     functionalities that can be affected.
    This document deals with:
    1)   building damage that is induced by (gaseous/liquid/solid) water, and
    2)   damage to building components, human health, and property contained in the enclosure. This document makes no mention of warranties for building damage.
