    ISO 11026:2010 specifies an open-loop test method for determining the roll stability of a vehicle negotiating a curve on dry surface.
    It applies to heavy vehicles, that is commercial vehicles, commercial vehicle combinations, buses and articulated buses as defined in ISO 3833 (trucks and trailers with maximum weight above 3,5 t and buses and articulated buses with maximum weight above 5 t, according to ECE and EC vehicle classification, categories M3, N2, N3, O3 and O4).
    The method is intended for vehicles equipped with electronic roll stability control systems.
