  content: "Standardized method of optimizing Facility provisioning within data centres
    by incorporating IT provisioning KPI’s that enable the development of Facility
    profiles of the space, power and cooling infrastructure required to support individual
    systems or platforms. The combination of the system and platform KPI’s are used
    to establish a Facility provisioning profile, establishing standard forecasting
    methods to optimize data centre resource effectiveness.\nIn-Scope:\n-\tMethod
    for benchmarking and trending Facility provisioning for space, power and cooling
    infrastructure\nExcluded:\n-\tIT equipment energy efficiency for servers (covered
    by ISO/IEC JTC 1 / SC 39 / WG 1 / 30134-4)\n-\tIT equipment utilization for servers
    (covered by ISO/IEC JTC 1 / SC 39 / WG 1 / 30134-5)\n-\tApplication platform energy
