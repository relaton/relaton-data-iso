    ISO 13289:2011 specifies minimum requirements for service providers offering supervised recreational snorkelling excursions.
    ISO 13289:2011 applies to activities that will include participants being taken into an open water environment. It does not apply to activities that are exclusively conducted in a confined water environment, e.g. pools.
    ISO 13289:2011 also specifies particular conditions under which the service is provided, in addition to the general requirements for recreational diving service provision specified in ISO 24803.
