    This document specifies:
    1)       Constructs for representing and specifying various augmentation and presentation styles. While augmentations can be in modalities other than the visual (e.g. aural, haptic), this work addresses the visual augmentation style only.
    2)       A model for how to associate the stylization constructs to the augmentation objects. Specifically, the MAR behavior object in ISO/IEC 3721 is extended for this purpose.
    3)       Other miscellaneous functionalities and abstractions that support the stylization of augmentation objects.
