abstract:
- content: "1.1  Purpose  \nThis document is intended to aid project managers in managing
    to successful conclusion those projects concerned with systems, including software
    systems.\nThis document specifies the required content of the project management
    plan (PMP). This document also quotes the extracted purpose and outcome statements
    from the technical management processes of ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 and ISO/IEC/IEEE
    12207, and adds detailed guidance for managing projects that use these processes
    for systems, including software systems.\nThis document is written for those who
    use or plan to use ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 and ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207 on projects dealing
    with systems, including software systems, regardless of project scope, products,
    methodology, size or complexity. The field of application of this document spans
    the whole system or software life cycle and addresses all project management roles,
    specifically:\n—          those responsible for establishing and continuously
    improving their organization's policies for implementing ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 system
    life cycle processes and ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207 software life cycle processes;\n—
    \         those responsible for executing any ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 system life cycle
    process or ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207 software life cycle process at a project level.\n—
    \         organizations or individuals subcontracting a project management effort.\nIn
    many organizations, the various responsibilities of project management are assigned
    to more than one person. Where the term \"project manager\" is used in this document,
    the guidance, advice or normative requirement is taken as applying to the applicable
    role within the organization.\nThis document is intended to provide guidance for
    two-party situations and can be equally applied where the two parties are from
    the same organization. This document can also be used by a single party as self-imposed
    tasks.\nThis document can also serve as guidance in multi-party situations, where
    high risks are inherent in the supply and integration of complex software-based
    systems, and procurement can involve several vendors, organizations or contracting
    parties.\nThe normative content specifications for PMPs and the guidance for application
    of the technical management processes have general application across the scope
    of ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 and ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207, but are developed with a focus on
    projects dealing with systems with a significant software element, and software
    systems."
