abstract:
- content: "This International standard specifies principles for verification methods
    of agricultural machinery and tractors that are used in agricultural applications
    and that have partially automated, semi-autonomous and autonomous functions.\n\nThe
    purpose of this document is to assist in the provision of more specific safety
    requirements, means of verification and information for use to ensure an appropriate
    level of safety for agricultural machinery and tractors with partially automated,
    semi-autonomous and autonomous functions used in a specified way.\n\nThis document
    deals with all the significant hazards, hazardous situations and events, relevant
    to agricultural machinery and tractors with partially automated, semi-autonomous
    and autonomous functions when used as intended and under the conditions of misuse
    foreseeable by the manufacturer during normal operation and service.\n\nWhile
    this document gives principles for the design, verification, validation and provision
    of information for use, the detailed requirements are dependent on the use case.
    Therefore, the design principles given in this document needs to be extended and
    clarified by the use of relevant specific (type-C) standards, when available,
    or by the manufacturer of the machine using a risk assessment. Applicability of
    the design principles and any additional requirements, for design, verification,
    validation or information for use are outside the scope of this document.\n\nNOTE\tSafety
    requirements for specific non-automated functions of agricultural machinery and
    tractors can be available in machine-specific type-C standards.\n\nThis document
    is not applicable to:\n\n—\tforestry applications;\n—\toperations on public roads
    including relevant requirements for braking and steering systems.\nThis document
    is not applicable to agricultural machinery and tractors which are manufactured
    before the date of its publication, or to systems applied to agricultural machinery
    and tractors put into use before the date of its publication."
