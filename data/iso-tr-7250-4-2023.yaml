    This document describes the knowledge and skill required for an experienced anthropometrist who serves as a measurer in anthropometric surveys or a planner of an anthropometric survey. This document also describes methods to quantify the skill of anthropometrists and to report their performance.
    This document is not a textbook or manual for anthropometry but can be useful for those who plan and conduct anthropometric surveys as well as designers and technologists who utilize anthropometric data. Methods described in this document can also be applicable to measurements other than those described in ISO 7250-1.
