  content: This document specifies the principles, categories, and codes for the classification
    of industrial wastewater and is applicable to all types and sources of industrial
    wastewater. It provides a broad framework classifying industrial wastewater into
    different categories based on industry type and the associated water quality constituents,
    namely physical, chemical and biological characteristics with a specific code
    assigned based on both industry type and waste-stream classification.
