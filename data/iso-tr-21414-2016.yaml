abstract:
- content: The application of geophysical methods is an evolving science that can
    address a variety of objectives in groundwater investigations. However, because
    the successful application of geophysical methods depends on the available technology,
    logistics, and expertise of the investigator, there can be no single set of field
    procedures or approaches prescribed for all cases. ISO/TR 21414:2016 provides
    guidelines that are useful for conducting geophysical surveys for a variety of
    objectives (including environmental aspects), within the limits of modern-day
    instrumentation and interpretive techniques, are provided. The more commonly used
    field techniques and practices are described, with an emphasis on electrical resistivity,
    electromagnetic, and seismic refraction techniques as these are widely used in
    groundwater exploration. Theoretical aspects and details of interpretational procedures
    are referred to only in a general way. For full details, reference is intended
    to be made to specialized texts listed in the Bibliography.
