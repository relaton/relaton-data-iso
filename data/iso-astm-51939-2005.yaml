    ISO/ASTM 51939:2005 outlines irradiator installation qualification, operational qualification, performance qualification, and routine product processing dosimetric procedures to be followed in the irradiation of blood and blood components by the blood-banking community. If followed, these procedures will help to ensure that the products processed with ionizing radiation from gamma, X-rays (bremsstrahlung), or electron sources receive absorbed doses within a predetermined range.
    ISO/ASTM 51939:2005 also covers the use of radiation-sensitive indicators for the visual and qualitative indication that the product has been irradiated.
