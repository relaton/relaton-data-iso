- content: |-
    This document specifies a method for the analysis of phenolic antioxidants by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).
    It is applicable to quantifying the following synthetic phenolic compounds added to animal and vegetable fats, oils and shortenings as antioxidants, at concentrations normally added to oils:
    —     propyl gallate (PG);
    —     octyl gallate (OG);
    —     dodecyl gallate (also called “lauryl gallate (LG)”);
    —     2,4,5-trihydroxybutyrophenone (THBP);
    —     tert-butylhydroquinone (TBHQ);
    —     nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA);
    —     2- and 3-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyanisole (BHA);
    —     2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-(hydroxymethyl)phenol (BHT Alcohol or Ionox-100);
    —     2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxytoluene (BHT).
    A method for determining the absence of an antioxidant, or the maximum trace amount, within the limits of the analysis, is given in Annex B.
    The issue of canolol, a naturally occurring substance in rapeseed, interfering with the analysis is addressed in Annex C.
