    ISO 24102-2:2015 provides specifications for Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) station management to be compliant with the ITS station reference architecture and the set of related standards from ISO/TC 204.
    Remote ITS station management is specified by means of protocol data units (PDUs) and procedures of the "Remote ITS Station Management Protocol" (RSMP) related to managed objects in an ITS station unit. Distinction is made between managed ITS station units (management clients) and managing remote ITS station units (management servers).
