- content: |-
    This document provides guidance on identifying and assessing impacts of climate change on wastewater systems and on developing strategies for the adaptation to these impacts. The assessment of the impacts is based on the assessment principles described in ISO 24566-1 Assessment Principles.

    This document also provides examples of some of the impacts of climate change on drinking water systems and of the responses that have been implemented by municipal water services or by the relevant jurisdiction (e.g., municipality or region served by the service). The examples of responses illustrate adaptation strategies that have been applied.
