    This document describes methods that can be used to test personal care robots in terms of safety requirements defined in ISO 13482. The target robots of this document are identical to those of ISO 13482.
    The manufacturer determines the required tests and appropriate testing parameters based on a risk assessment of the robot's design and usage. This risk assessment can determine that tests and test parameters other than those contained in this document are acceptable.
    Not all test methods are applicable to all robot types. Test methods labelled "universal" are applicable to all personal care robots. For other tests, the heading states for which robot types the test can be applied (e.g. "for wearable robot" or "for mobile robot").
    Some test methods can be replaced by using other applicable standards, even if they are not listed in this document.
