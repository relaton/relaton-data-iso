abstract:
- content: |-
    ISO/TS 27893:2009 gives guidelines for the determination and reporting of measurement uncertainties arising during vacuum gauge calibration by direct comparison with a reference gauge in accordance with ISO/TS 3567. It describes methods for uniform reporting of uncertainties in vacuum gauge certificates. Uncertainties reported in accordance with ISO/TS 27893:2009 are transferable in the sense that the uncertainty evaluated for one result can be used as a component in the uncertainty evaluation of another measurement or calibration in which the first result is used.
    This specification defines two measurement models that are sufficient to cover most practical cases. However, it is possible that the models given cannot be applied to newly developed vacuum gauges.
    The final uncertainty to be reported in a certificate is evaluated from the uncertainties of the input quantities and influence quantities. The principal quantities that may affect the result of a vacuum calibration are described; however, a complete list of the possible quantities that may have an influence on the final result lies outside the scope of ISO/TS 27893:2009.
