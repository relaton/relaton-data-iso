  content: This document specifies security-related interindustry commands that are
    intended to be used for personal verification through biometric methods in integrated
    circuit cards. It also defines the data structure and data access methods for
    use of the card as a carrier of the biometric reference and/or as the device to
    perform the verification of the cardholder's biometric probe (on-card biometric
    comparison). Identification of persons using biometric methods is outside the
    scope of this document.
