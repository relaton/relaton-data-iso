    This document specifies the application module for AP239 product definition information.
    The following are within the scope of this document:
    - the representation of parts, their versions, their definitions, and their management information, such as dates, that are assigned to them;
    - the representation of assignments of an identifier and alias identifications to parts and their versions;
    - the representation of characterization views of a version of a part;
    - the representation of the data that identify a product and the categories of products it belongs to;
    - the representation of relationships between versions of products;
    - the representation of context-dependent relationships between definitions of product versions;
    - the representation of the composition of an assembly as parent-child relationships between views on products;
    - the representation of the shape of an assembly as the composition of the shape representation of its components;
    - the association of valued properties to a part or to an assembly;
    - the association of documentation to a part or to an assembly;
    - the identification of positions within an assembly of parts to which component parts may be attached;
    - the identification of parts that are attached to identified positions within an assembly;
    - the identification of a breakdown of a product or product_as_individual;
    - the identification of the elements that comprise a breakdown;
    - the identification of parent-child relationships between breakdown elements;
    - the identification of relationships between elements in different breakdowns;
    - the representation of the replacement of a product by another;
    - the representation and classification of documents and document information that may apply to part definition information;
    - the representation of properties of objects, their values and types, and classifications;
    - the representation of information that records the identification of an existing or potential future artifact - an actual product whose properties can only be known by observation or by derivation from observations;
    - the representation of interfaces between products;
    - the representation of the life cycle phase of existing interfaces between actual products (as realized), and includes planned interfaces between planned products;
    - the representation of relationships between requirements and items to which they are assigned, and between requirements and the items which are their source;
    - the representation of the information that identify a requirement and versions of requirements;
    - the representation of characterization views of a requirement version;
    - the representation of relationships between requirements which are expressed as relationships between requirement view definitions;
    - the representation of a type of state;
    - the representation of an observed state;
    - the identification of the configuration of a product for a given product concept;
    - the specification of effectivity constraints applied to configuration of a product.
