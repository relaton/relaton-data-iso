    This document specifies the minimum design and performance requirements for clothing as part of personal protective equipment (PPE) to be used by firefighters, primarily but not solely to protect against exposure to flame and high thermal loads, and particulates (including other products of combustion).
    To assist with choice based on user risk assessment, a single level of heat and flame protection is included with a number of options that can provide additional protection. For more information on firefighter risk assessment consult ISO/TR 21808.
    The scope of this document does not include clothing for use in high-risk fire exposures where for example, reflective protective clothing according to ISO 15538 could be more appropriate, or for use in long-term firefighting operations in high ambient temperature, for example bush, wildland, or forest firefighting where clothing according to ISO 15384 (ISO 16073-3) could be more appropriate.
    Similarly, this document does not include clothing to protect against chemical and biological hazards, other than against short-term and accidental exposure while engaged in firefighting and associated activities when fighting fires occurring in structures.
    This document describes types, design, and performance of clothing, the specific requirements for clothing, marking, and manufacturer’s instructions.
