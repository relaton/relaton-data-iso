abstract:
- content: Establishes rules for determining the loads, types and combinations of
    loads (main, additional and special loads) which must be taken into account when
    designing steel structures for mobile continuous bulk handling equipment. Is applicable
    to rail-mounted mobile equipment, especially to stackers, shiploaders, reclaimers,
    combined stackers and reclaimers and continuous ship unloaders (equipment fitted
    with bucket wheels or bucket chains). For other equipment, e.g. excavators, scrapers,
    reclaimers with scraper chain, mixed tyre or caterpillar-mounted stackers and
    reclaimers, the clauses as adapted to each type of apparatus are applicable.
