  content: 'ISO/TS 11155-2:2002 specifies a test comprising methods for measuring
    the dynamic gas adsorption of air filters in the passenger compartments of road
    vehicles. These laboratory test methods are applicable to air filters that improve
    air quality by reducing concentrations of gaseous, odorous or hazardous components
    from ambient or recirculated air, or both, in the vehicle cabin. They provide
    a means of measuring air pressure loss, as well as gas and vapour removal characteristics. '
