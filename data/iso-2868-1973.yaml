abstract:
- content: The sample is hydrolyzed by refluxing under acid conditions. The non-hydrolyzable
    anionic-active matter is determined by the direct two-phase titration procedure
    describes in ISO 2271. This method is applicable to the determination of cyclic
    sulphonates in alkylphenol ether sulphates and of small amounts of sulphonates
    in sulphated fatty alcohols. The molar mass of the anionic matter must be known
    or previously determined, if its content is expressed as percentage by mass.
