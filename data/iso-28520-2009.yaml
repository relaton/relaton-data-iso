  content: "ISO 28520:2009 provides guidance for flushing of lubricating oil systems,
    and grading of the resultant cleanliness. The flushing process is twofold:\n-
    to remove dirt from the erection and installation, and\n- to demonstrate that
    the pipes and the system as a whole is sufficiently clean. \nCrankcase and, where
    applicable, gearbox etc. are cleaned separately before flushing, and requirements
    relating to this are also specified in ISO 28520:2009. Similar considerations
    apply to the system tank and other components of the system.\nFor the purposes
    of ISO 28520:2009, the cleaning process is considered as “washing through” when
    the Reynolds is equal to or less than 3 000 and “flushing” when the Reynolds number
    is equal to or greater than 3 000.\nWhere available, any original equipment manufacturer
    requirements for flushing take precedence over the requirements outlined in ISO
    28520:2009."
