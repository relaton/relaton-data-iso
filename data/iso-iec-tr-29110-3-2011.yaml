  content: "ISO/IEC TR 29110-3:2011 defines the process assessment guidelines and
    conformance requirements needed to meet the purpose of defined VSE Profiles. It
    is applicable to all VSE Profiles and is compatible with ISO/IEC 15504-2. \nThe
    possible uses of ISO/IEC TR 29110-3:2011 are as follows.\nThe target audience
    of ISO/IEC TR 29110-3:2011 is primarily those who perform process assessments
    for VSEs. ISO/IEC TR 29110-3:2011 also contains information that can be useful
    to developers of assessment methods and assessment tools. \nISO/IEC TR 29110-3:2011
    is addressed to people who have a direct relation with the assessment process
    based on the VSE Profiles, e.g. the assessor and the sponsor of the assessment,
    who need guidance on ensuring that the requirements for performing an assessment
    have been met."
