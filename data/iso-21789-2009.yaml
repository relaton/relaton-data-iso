  content: |-
    ISO 21789:2009 covers the safety requirements for gas turbine applications using liquid or gaseous fuels and the safety-related control and detection systems and essential auxiliaries for all types of open cycles (simple, combined, regenerative, reheat, etc.) used in onshore and offshore applications including floating production platforms.
    It  applies to driven machinery only where an integral part of the gas turbine (e.g. a gearbox integral to the gas turbine) or located within the gas turbine enclosure and forming part of the enclosure hazardous area classification (e.g. a generator within the gas turbine enclosure), or where the driven machinery has a direct effect on the operational safety of the gas turbine.
    It details the anticipated significant hazards associated with gas turbines and specifies the appropriate preventative measures and processes for reduction or elimination of these hazards. It addresses the risks of injury or death to humans and risks to the environment. Equipment damage without risk to humans or the environment is not covered.
    It excludes gas turbines used primarily for direct and indirect propulsion, special heat source applications and in research and development programmes. It also excludes gas turbines for closed-cycle and semi-closed cycle applications, and compressed-air energy storage plants. Where appropriate, it can be used to give general guidance in such applications.
    It is not applicable to machinery or safety components that were manufactured before the date of its publication.
