    This document describes a framework and principles that are coherent with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, including the New Urban Agenda, Paris Agreement and Sendai Framework, that can be applied to enhance urban resilience. This document proposes the use of metrics and models as the framework upon which to structure urban resilience to assist local authorities and other urban stakeholder's efforts to build more resilient human settlements.
    This document is primarily intended for use by organizations with responsibility for urban governance. However, it is equally applicable to all types and sizes of organizations that represent the community of stakeholders noted above, and in particular those organizations that have a role in urban planning, development and management processes in urban areas around the world.
