    This document specifies the nature, the method of application, the surface condition, performance requirements and the minimum thickness of internal linings of cement mortar for ductile iron pipes and fittings for pressure and non-pressure pipelines as defined in ISO 2531, ISO 7186 and ISO 16631.
    It covers cement mortar linings which are used to improve the hydraulic properties of pipes and fittings compared to un-lined pipes and fittings and/or to prevent corrosion damage and includes special requirements for linings of gravity sewers operating partially filled.
    It also covers linings used for the conveyance of particularly aggressive fluids, where the following solutions can be used either separately or in combination:
    a)       an increase in the thickness of the lining;
    b)       a change of the type of cement;
    c)        a coating over the lining.
