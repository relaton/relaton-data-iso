    This part of ISO/IEC 13211 is designed to promote the
    applicability and portability of Prolog modules that contain
    Prolog text complying with the requirements of the Programming
    Language Prolog as specified in this part of ISO/IEC 13211.
    This part of ISO/IEC 13211 specifies:
    a) The representation of Prolog text that constitutes a Prolog
    module,
    b) The constraints that shall be satisfied to prepare Prolog
    modules for execution, and
    c) The requirements, restrictions and limits imposed on a
    conforming Prolog processor that processes modules.
    This part of ISO/IEC 13211 does not specify:
    a) The size or number of Prolog modules that will exceed the
    capacity of any specific data processing system or language
    processor, or the actions to be taken when the limit is
    exceeded,
    b) The methods of activating the Prolog processor or the
    set of commands used to control the environment in which
    Prolog modules are prepared for execution,
    c) The mechanisms by which Prolog modules are loaded,
    d) The relationship between Prolog modules and the
    processor-specific file system.
    1.1 Notes
    Notes in this part of ISO/IEC 13211 have no effect on the
    language, Prolog text, module text or Prolog processors that are
    defined as conforming to this part of ISO/IEC 13211. Reasons
    for including a note include:
    a) Cross references to other clauses and subclauses of this
    part of ISO/IEC 13211 in order to help readers find their
    way around,
    b) Warnings when a built-in predicate as defined in this part
    of ISO/IEC 13211 has a different meaning in some existing
    implementations.
