abstract:
- content: |-
    This document applies to electric and electronic systems and components for vehicles including electric propulsion systems and components with maximum working voltages according to voltage class B. It describes the potential environmental stresses and specifies tests and requirements recommended for the specific mounting location on/in the vehicle.
    This document describes chemical loads.
    This document is not intended to apply to environmental requirements or testing for systems and components of motorcycles and mopeds.
    NOTE            Conditions and testing for a continuous contact with chemical agents can be determined from other standards or upon agreement between the customer and the supplier.
    Systems and their components released for production, or systems and their components already under development prior to the publication date of this document, can be exempted from fulfilling the changes in this edition compared to the previous one.
