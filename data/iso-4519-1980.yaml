  content: The sampling plans are applicable to the inspection of end items, components,
    materials in process and finished products in storage. The plan are intended to
    be used for a continuing series and lots, but they may also be used for isolated
    lots. ISO 4510 is not applicable to the sampling and testing of mechanical fasteners
    having electrodeposited metallic coatings or related finishes. These sampling
    plans are based on AQL's of 1,5 and 4,0 %.
