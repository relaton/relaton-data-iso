abstract:
- content: 'The tests (verification of wiping system: static and aerodynamic tests;
    verification of functioning: frequency test, stall test, low temperature test)
    need not be repeated on types of power-driven vehicles which do not differ from
    one another in respect of the following features: shape, size, surface and aerodynamic
    characteristics of the windscreen and its surroundings, characteristics of each
    system designated by the vehicle manufacturer as contributing to wiping of the
    windscreen. Appropriate testing for rear windows is dealt with in ISO 6255.'
