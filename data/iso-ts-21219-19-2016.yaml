    ISO/TS 21219-19:2016 defines the TPEG Weather (WEA) application for reporting weather information for travellers. It provides general weather-related information to all travellers and is not limited to a specific mode of transportation.
    This application does not provide specific weather-related safety warnings to drivers; these are provided as Safety Related Messages as part of the TPEG2-TEC application.
    The WEA application provides weather-related forecasts and status information over multiple time periods and for multiple, possibly linked, geographical areas.
    NOTE          The presentation of the information is dependent of the specific HMI of the receiving device. ISO/TS 21219-19 :2016, therefore, does not define any prerequisites for the HMI of the device.
