    ISO/PAS 20858:2004 establishes a framework to assist marine port facilities in specifying the competence of personnel to conduct a marine port facility security assessment and developing a security plan as required by the ISPS Code, conducting the marine port facility security assessment, and drafting a Port Facility Security Plan (PFSP).
    In addition, ISO/PAS 20858:2004 establishes certain documentation requirements designed to ensure that the process used in performing the duties described above was recorded in a manner that would permit independent verification by a qualified and authorized agency (if the port facility has agreed to the review).
