    ISO 16486-4:2016 specifies the characteristics of valves made from unplasticized polyamide (PA-U) in accordance with ISO 16486‑1, intended to be buried and used for the supply of gaseous fuels.
    Valves made from other material than unplasticized polyamide designed for the supply of gaseous fuels conforming to the relevant standards are permitted to be used in PA-U piping system according to ISO 16486 provided they have relevant PA-U connections for butt fusion or electrofusion ends (see ISO 16486‑3). The component, i.e. the complete valve, shall fulfil the requirements of this part of ISO 16486.
    It also specifies the test parameters for the test methods referred to in this part of ISO 16486.
    It is applicable to bi-directional valves with spigot end or electrofusion socket intended to be jointed with PA-U pipes conforming to ISO 16486‑2 without any fittings or with PA-U fittings conforming to ISO 16486‑3.
    ISO 16486-4:2016 covers valves for pipes with a nominal outside diameter, dn, ≤250 mm.
