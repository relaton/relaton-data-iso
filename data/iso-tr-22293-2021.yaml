  content: This document reviews and evaluates the utility of available methods to
    assess material released from commercial polymer composites in support of product
    use and safety decisions, and describes what revised or additional methods are
    needed. The document is not focused on describing methods per se; rather the goal
    is to describe information that is appropriate for consideration in the selection
    of methods to support decision-making.
