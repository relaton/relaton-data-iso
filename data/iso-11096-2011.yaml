    ISO 11096:2011 specifies a test method for simulating the lateral impact between the front of a passenger vehicle or light truck vehicle derived from passenger cars (as defined in ISO 3833) and an adult pedestrian.
    The test method addresses the reduction of pedestrian thigh, leg and knee injuries. It is not applicable to testing for, or the evaluation of, injuries to other pedestrian body regions, nor does it directly cover the potential risk of injury to children or human soft tissue. It is not applicable to vehicles with deployable devices designed for activation in the event of impact with a pedestrian.
