abstract:
- content: Specifies a method for determining fuel leakage. Evaluation of fire risk
    is based on the assumption that a fire is unlikely to occur when the leakage from
    the fuel system under certain collision conditions is zero or very small. Applies
    to passenger cars where the engine is fed by liquid fuel.
