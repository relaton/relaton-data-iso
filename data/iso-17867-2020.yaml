- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: 'This document specifies a method for the application of small-angle X-ray
    scattering (SAXS) to the estimation of mean particle sizes in the 1 nm to 100
    nm size range. It is applicable in dilute dispersions where the interaction and
    scattering effects between the particles are negligible. This document describes
    several data evaluation methods: the Guinier approximation, model-based data fitting,
    Monte-Carlo?based data fitting, the indirect Fourier transform method and the
    expectation maximization method. The most appropriate evaluation method is intended
    to be selected by the analyst and stated clearly in the report. While the Guinier
    approximation only provides an estimate for the mean particle diameter, the other
    methods also give insight in the particle size distribution.'
