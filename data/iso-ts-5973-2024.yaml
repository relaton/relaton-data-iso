abstract:
- content: This document gives guidance on the determination criteria for when laser
    diffraction is the most appropriate method for the analysis of samples, the appropriate
    preparation of samples, the verification of the correct functioning of instruments,
    the interpretation of data, and the assessment of data quality. This document
    focuses on the practical steps needed to obtain results of good quality, rather
    than on theoretical considerations, and covers not only the measurement of solid
    particles (in wet and dry measurement configurations), but also emulsions and
    bubbles. Result variation expectations of real samples are also considered in
    this document.
