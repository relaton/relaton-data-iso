    This International Standard provides specifications and test procedures for establishing the safety of photographic
    films with respect to hazards from fire. The specifications are applicable to both unprocessed and processed1) films
    on any type of currently known plastic support.
    These specifications cover silver films (both gelatin and non-gelatin types), colour films, diazo films, vesicular films,
    and striped or full-width magnetic films. Magnetic tapes and video recording tapes are excluded.
    A field test for burning behaviour is described in informative annex B, and methods of marking film are defined in
    informative annex C. A simple test to distinguish non-safety nitrate-base film from cellulose ester and polyesterbase
    film is given in informative annex D.
