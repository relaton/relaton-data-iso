    This document describes the orthographic system of the Akson-Thai-Noi script using Romanized characters.
    This document can be used by anyone who has a clear understanding of the system and is certain that it can be applied without ambiguity. The result obtained will not give a correct pronunciation of the original text in a person's own language, but it will serve as a means of finding automatically the original graphism and thus allow anyone who has a knowledge of the original language to pronounce it correctly.
    NOTE       Similarly, one can only pronounce correctly a text written in, for example, English or Polish, if one has a knowledge of English or Polish.
