    ISO 17584:2005 specifies thermophysical properties of several commonly used refrigerants and refrigerant blends.
    ISO 17584:2005 is applicable to the refrigerants R12, R22, R32, R123, R125, R134a, R143a, R152a, R717 (ammonia), and R744 (carbon dioxide) and to the refrigerant blends R404A, R407C, R410A, and R507. The following properties are included: density, pressure, internal energy, enthalpy, entropy, heat capacity at constant pressure, heat capacity at constant volume, speed of sound, and the Joule-Thomson coefficient, in both single-phase states and along the liquid-vapour saturation boundary. The numerical designation of these refrigerants is that defined in ISO 817.
