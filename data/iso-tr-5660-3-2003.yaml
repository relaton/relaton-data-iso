abstract:
- content: "ISO/TR 5660-3:2003 examines the limitations of the cone calorimeter as
    currently used for building products and recommends ways in which some of these
    may be overcome for other types of products for other application areas. It compiles
    information from a large body of experience with regard to the use of the instrument
    into a set of guidelines which will help to standardize the use of the cone calorimeter
    in this wider scope.\nParticular guidance is given on aspects of specimen preparation
    and on the behaviour, such as melting, spalling and intumescing, of specimens
    exposed to radiant heat. The relevance of specimen thickness and the use of substrate,
    and methods of fixing to substrate, are also discussed. Advice is given on approaches
    to testing a variety of \"non standard\" products. Recommendations are made on
    techniques of calibration of the apparatus, selection of appropriate heat flux
    levels and ignition protocols. \nIn addition to the guidance given to operators,
    ISO/TR 5660-3:2003 makes recommendations on presentation of the test results."
