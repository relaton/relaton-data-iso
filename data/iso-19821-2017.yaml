abstract:
- content: ISO 19821:2017 specifies the procedures to establish a span rating for
    natural fibre-reinforced plastic composite (NFC) deck boards and deck boards used
    as stair treads, provided that the stair treads are produced from the same materials
    and processing techniques as the deck boards. This document covers test methods
    of performance, acceptance criteria and determination of span rating. It is intended
    to establish the basis for code recognition of deck boards used in exterior applications
    where combustible construction is allowed.
