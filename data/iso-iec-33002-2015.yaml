    ISO/IEC 33002:2015 defines the minimum set of requirements for performing an assessment that will ensure assessment results are objective, consistent, repeatable, and representative of the assessed processes.
    The requirements defined in ISO/IEC 33002:2015 can be used by or on behalf of an organization to
    a)    facilitate self-assessment,
    b)    provide a basis for improving process performance and mitigating process-related risk,
    c)    produce a rating of the achievement of the relevant process quality characteristic, and
    d)    provide an objective benchmark between organizations.
    ISO/IEC 33002:2015 is applicable across all application domains and sizes of organization.
