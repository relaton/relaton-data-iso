    This document specifies the typical requirements of instrumentation for measuring liquid precipitation, primarily for the purpose of hydrological and meteorological observation. This document is applicable to both non-recording and recording catching-type precipitation gauges for the measurement of liquid precipitation. This document covers design criteria for the gauges and elements to be considered in their construction. This document does not include specification, design and installation conditions.
    NOTE       Since the measurement of solid precipitation is outside the scope, the disadvantages of solid precipitation apply to all gauges listed in Annex A. The measurement of solid precipitation and associated disadvantages are well documented in Reference [1].
