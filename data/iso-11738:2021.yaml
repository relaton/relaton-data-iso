    This document specifies requirements for the components and method of installation of pressurized irrigation system control heads, referred to hereinafter as irrigation control heads, with a nominal size of up to and including 200 mm (nominal size of an irrigation control head or nominal size of a component).
    This document is applicable only to the above-ground components of irrigation control heads for sprinkler irrigation and micro-irrigation (mini-sprinklers, drip irrigation, etc.). It is applicable to the basic irrigation control head, on which other irrigation control and command components (electrical, electronic and hydraulic) can be assembled, but does not deal with these additional components.
    This document is not applicable to systems and/or components that can be required to prevent the water from freezing in the irrigation control head, such as dry-barrel hydrants or other types of hydrants.
    This document does not specify construction or operating requirements for the individual components that make up the irrigation control head. These requirements are specified in the relevant standards for each component.
