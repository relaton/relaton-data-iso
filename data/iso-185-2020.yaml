  content: "1      Scope  \nThis document specifies the properties of unalloyed and
    low-alloyed grey cast irons used for castings that have been manufactured in sand
    moulds or in moulds with comparable thermal behaviour.\nThis document specifies
    the characterizing properties of grey cast irons by any of the following:\na)
    \  the tensile strength of cast samples;\nb)   if agreed by the manufacturer and
    the purchaser, the tensile strength of samples cut from a casting;\nc)   if agreed
    between the manufacturer and the purchaser, the hardness of the material determined
    on castings or on a cast-on knob.\nIf agreed by the manufacturer and the purchaser,
    the combination of tensile strength from option a) or option b) and plus hardness
    from option c) can be specified. Information on specifying a combination of tensile
    strength and hardness is given in Annex B.\nThis document specifies eight grades
    of grey cast iron according to tensile strength (see Table 1) and six grades of
    grey cast iron according to Brinell hardness (see Table 2).\nThis document does
    not apply to grey cast irons used for pipes and pipe fittings and continuous cast
    products.\nThis document does not cover technical delivery conditions for grey
    iron castings.\nNOTE    General information on the engineering properties of grey
    cast irons is provided in ISO/TR 10809-1."
