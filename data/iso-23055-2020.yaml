    This document specifies the material requirements and dimensions of an international flange for the transfer of ballast water between a ship and a shore reception facility, or between ships.
    It does not address any reconfiguration of the ship's ballast water piping system necessary to connect to the shore-side, e.g. construction of piping from the ship lower machinery levels to the main deck transfer area.
