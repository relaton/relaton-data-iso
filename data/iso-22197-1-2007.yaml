    ISO 22197 -1:2007 specifies a test method for the determination of the air-purification performance of materials that contain a photocatalyst or have photocatalytic films on the surface, usually made from semiconducting metal oxides, such as titanium dioxide or other ceramic materials, by continuous exposure of a test piece to the model air pollutant under illumination with ultraviolet light. ISO 22197 -1:2007 is intended for use with different kinds of materials, such as construction materials in flat sheet, board or plate shape, that are the basic forms of materials for various applications. ISO 22197 -1:2007 also applies to materials in honeycomb-form, and to plastic or paper materials if they contain ceramic microcrystals and composites. ISO 22197 -1:2007 does not apply to powder or granular photocatalytic materials.
    This test method is usually applicable to photocatalytic materials produced for air purification. This method is not suitable for the determination of other performance attributes of photocatalytic materials, i.e., decomposition of water contaminants, self-cleaning, antifogging and antibacterial actions. It concerns the removal of nitric oxide.
