abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 19500-1:2012 specifies the CORBA Object Model and uses concepts
    from that model to define the operation of the Object Request Broker (ORB). The
    ORB is the basic mechanism by which objects transparently make requests to, and
    receive responses from, each other on the same machine or across a network. A
    client need not be aware of the mechanisms used to communicate with or activate
    an object, how the object is implemented, or where the object is located.
