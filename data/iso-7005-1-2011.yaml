    ISO 7005-1:2011 establishes a base specification for pipe flanges suitable for general purpose and industrial applications including, but not limited to, chemical process industries, electric power generating industries, petroleum and natural gas industries. It places responsibility for the selection of a flange series with the purchaser.
    It is applicable to flanges within facilities engaged in the processing or handling of a wide variety of fluids, including steam, pressurized water and chemical, petroleum, natural gas or related products.
    ISO 7005-1:2011 is also applicable to packaged equipment piping, which interconnects individual pieces or stages of equipment within a packaged equipment assembly for use within facilities engaged in the processing or handling of a variety of fluids, including steam and chemical, petroleum, natural gas or related products.
