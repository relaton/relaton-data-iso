    IWA 8:2009 establishes requirements for the use of the glass designations “clear glass” and “ultra-clear glass” for non-coloured glass items according to their clarity and iron content. IWA 8:2009 specifies a procedure for measuring the clarity of glass items by means of a spectrophotometer.
    IWA 8:2009 is applicable to
    -        mineral glasses, and
    -        glass items where a part is not covered by coating or decoration, and is therefore available for sampling.
    IWA 8:2009 is applicable to the use of glass as tableware, giftware, jewellery and luminaries.
    IWA 8:2009 is not applicable to the use of glass in the context of building, containers, medicine and laboratories, and to other technical uses of glass.
