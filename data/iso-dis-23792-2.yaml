  content: "Motorway Chauffeur Systems (MCS) performs level 3 automated driving [1]
    on limited access motorways with the presence of a fallback-ready user (FRU).
    MCS will be implemented in various forms capable of responding to different driving
    scenarios.  \nThis document specifies the requirements and test procedure to verify
    the requirements for the discretionary lane change functionality (DLC). The DLC
    is an additional functionality that a MCS compliant to the general requirements
    specified in ISO 23792-1 can be equipped with. \nWhen conditions are satisfied,
    a DLC equipped MCS performs the entire DDT to change the current lane of travel
    even though it is still possible to continue operation within its current lane
    of travel. The system monitors the driving environment in the adjacent lanes and
    operates the SV by adjusting the speed and lateral position to move the SV to
    the intended lane. MCS may delay the manoeuvre until the conditions for initiating
    the lane change are satisfied or cancel the lane change when conditions are not
    satisfied. \nActivation of the DLC requires an engaged MCS performing in-lane
    driving. Means related to setting a destination and selecting a route to reach
    the destination are not in the scope of this document. This document applies to
    the system installed in light vehicles [2].\n\nReference;\n[1] ISO/SAE PAS 22736,
    Intelligent transport systems -- Taxonomy and definitions for terms related to
    driving automation systems for on-road motor vehicles\n[2] International Organization
