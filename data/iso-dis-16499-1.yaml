  content: "This document describes a basic role model of smart city automated mobility
    services as a common platform for smart city instantiation. It provides a paradigm
    describing: \na)   a framework architecture for the provision of an automated
    mobility service\nb)   a description of the concept of operations, and the role
    models\nc)   a conceptual architecture between actors involved in the provision/receipt
    of automated mobility service applications\nd)   references for the key documents
    on which the architecture is based\ne)  a taxonomy of the organization of generic
    procedures. scope is specialized in defining the requirements of the basic role
    and functional model of service for the introduction of automated mobility services
    including infrastructure facilities to support mobility in urban and rural areas.
    \nIn-vehicle control system is not in scope of this document."
