  content: 'ISO 17577:2006 specifies a method for the automated and/or manual ultrasonic
    testing of uncoated steel flat products for internal discontinuities by the reflection
    method. It is applicable to non-alloyed or alloyed steel flat products, in a nominal
    thickness range of 6 mm to 200 mm. However, this standard may be applied to austenitic
    and austenitic-ferritic steels, provided that the difference between the amplitude
    of the noise signal and that of the echo detection threshold is sufficient for
    the limit fixed. Unless otherwise agreed, for testing of steel flat products for
    welded steel tubes, ISO 12094 applies. '
