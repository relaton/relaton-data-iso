  content: "ISO/TR 17671-4 gives general guidance for the satisfactory design, production
    and control of welding and details the possible detrimental effects which may
    occur, together with advice on methods by which they may be avoided. Generally
    it is applicable to all types of aluminium materials and is appropriate regardless
    of the type of fabrication involved, although the application standard/contract
    may have additional requirements. \nThis part of ISO/TR 17671 details only welding-related
    matters and does not give any details of mechanical properties of the welded joint.
    It identifies the main factors that affect the welding of aluminium.\nThis part
    of ISO/TR 17671 gives general recommendations for the manual, mechanized and automatic
    fusion welding of wrought and cast aluminium alloys and combinations thereof. "
