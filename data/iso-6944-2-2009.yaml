  content: ISO 6944-2:2009 establishes a method of test in which kitchen extract ducts
    are required to provide fire resistance. The requirements are intended to limit
    the spread of fire from the duct when a fire occurs within the duct and assesses
    the structural integrity of the duct when a fire occurs in the area surrounding
    the duct.
