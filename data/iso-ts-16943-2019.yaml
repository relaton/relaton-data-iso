    This document describes the phased array ultrasonic testing (PAUT) of polyethylene electrofusion (EF) socket joints used for the conveyance of fluids. This document provides a test whereby the presence of imperfections such as voids, wire dislocation, misalignment, pipe under-penetration, particulate contamination, cold fusion and lack of fusion in electrofusion socket joints can be detected. The technique is only applicable to polyethylene electrofusion socket fittings without a barrier to ultrasonic waves. This document also provides requirements for procedure qualification and guidance for personnel qualifications, which are essential for the application of this test method
    NOTE 1  At the time of publication, experience only exists on the use of PAUT for polyethylene (PE80 and PE100) electrofusion socket joint sizes between 90 mm and 710 mm (SDR 11 and 17)[7][8][9][10][11][12][13].
    NOTE 2  Round robin testing has shown that PAUT is a viable method for enhancing the integrity assessment of electrofusion joints[16].
    NOTE 3  This document does not apply to the detection of unscraped pipe. Such detection can be achieved by a simple visual inspection, provided mechanical scraping tools are employed.
