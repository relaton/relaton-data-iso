  content: This International Standard defines terms and commercial specifications
    for winter maintenance machines and equipment which are designed to clear snow
    from highways, roads, streets, squares (except flight operation areas). Both the
    terms and the defines terms and commercial specifications have been determined
    in accordance with the intended use for which the machinery is intended by the
    manufacturer. The terms do not cover all possible winter maintenance machines
    and equipment and related work or machines, nor do they describe specific machines,
    but they serve as an aid to nomenclature. This International Standard is applicable
    to machinery designed for use in winter maintenance.
