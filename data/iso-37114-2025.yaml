    This document provides:
    —     an appraisal framework for datasets and data processing methods that create and use urban management information derived from statistics, objectives, indicators and long-term goals for sustainable development of cities and communities;
    —     numerous combinations of data sources and data processing methods, making it easier to create and maintain urban management information and get ready for value mining of big data within cities and communities;
    —     approaches to appraise the necessary data to generate management information in an organization and how to classify them into different categories for regular review and update over time;
    —     functional requirements to support the design, daily operation and management of information systems.
    This document is designed to be compatible with artificial intelligence (AI) systems. It helps cities and communities prepare for the application of AI in digital fields towards sustainable development. This includes the adoption of AI systems to process and analyse data collected from various sources. The goal is to identify and solve problems that cities and communities face to aid decision-making and achieve the six sustainability purposes as provided in ISO 37101, which align with the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in the long term.
    This document is in line with the delivery principles of a smart city provided by ISO 37106, including visionary, citizen-centric, digital, open and collaborative. This document is useful for support data and dataset management for standards on indicators for sustainable cities and communities developed by ISO/TC 268, but does not provide guidance on how to use those standards. Additionally, this document can be of use in research and educational activities.
