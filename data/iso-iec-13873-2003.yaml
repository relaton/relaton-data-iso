    ISO/IEC 13873:2003 specifies the signalling protocol for the support of Call Diversion supplementary services (SS-DIV) at the Q reference point between Private Integrated services Network eXchanges (PINXs) connected together within a Private Integrated Services Network (PISN). The Call Diversion supplementary services are Call Forwarding Unconditional (SS-CFU), Call Forwarding Busy (SS-CFB), Call Forwarding No Reply (SS-CFNR) and Call Deflection (SS-CD).
    SS-CFU, SS-CFB, SS-CFNR and SS-CD are supplementary services which permit a served user to have the PISN send all or specific incoming calls addressed to the served user's PISN number to another number.
    The Q reference point is defined in ISO/IEC 11579-1.
    Service specifications are produced in three stages and according to the method specified in ETS 300 387. ISO/IEC 13873:2003 contains the stage 3 specification for the Q reference point and satisfies the requirements identified by the stage 1 and stage 2 specifications in ISO/IEC 13872.
    The signalling protocol for SS-DIV operates on top of the signalling protocol for basic circuit switched call control, as specified in ISO/IEC 11572 and uses certain aspects of the generic procedures for the control of supplementary services specified in ISO/IEC 11582.
    ISO/IEC 13873:2003 also specifies additional signalling protocol requirements for the support of interactions at the Q reference point between SS-DIV and other supplementary services and ANFs.
    ISO/IEC 13873:2003 is applicable to PINXs which can be interconnected to form a PISN.
