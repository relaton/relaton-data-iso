    ISO 10596:2009 specifies the type, structure, function, performance and testing method of marine wind vane and anemometers (hereafter referred to as “wind vane/anemometer”) to be installed on a ship for measurement and indication of wind direction and velocity at sea for the purpose of navigation, as recommended by Regulation 5 of Chapter V of the international convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS), 1974, as amended.
    It does not apply to wind vanes and anemometers used for the purposes of meteorological or scientific measurement and observation.
