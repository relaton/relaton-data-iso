    This document provides requirements and guidance on lubricant supply arrangements and monitoring for liquid-lubricated bearings (plain bearing assemblies) such as those specified in ISO 11687 (all parts).
    This document is intended to assist the design of oil-based lubrication systems for hydrodynamic plain bearings mainly to be used in large-scale rotating machinery for power generation, industry and transportation.
    This document focuses on the most important requirements and characteristics of lubricant supply arrangements and monitoring for plain bearings. Additional standards such as ISO 10438‑1, ISO 10438‑2 and ISO 10438‑3 would be needed to design complete low-pressure or high-pressure lubrication systems, along with their corresponding components.
    Wherever this document specifies a particular form of solution, whether design or operation, different solutions can be selected provided they are justified by engineering assessment or reference to similar systems already in operation.
