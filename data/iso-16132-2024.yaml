    This document specifies the requirements for seal coatings for factory application to the surfaces of cement mortar linings, which are factory applied to the interior of ductile iron pipes and fittings.
    It provides the performance requirements for short-term sealing efficiency, long-term durability and cyclic pressure, as well as the routine testing requirements for visual appearance, coating thickness and adhesion.
    This document is applicable to products for potable and irrigation water and for other applications as per agreement between manufacturer and customer.
