abstract:
- content: This document specifies a method for the determination of tensile properties
    such as tensile strength, Young’s modulus, and fracture strain of ceramic filaments
    at elevated temperature in air using the hot grip technique. The method applies
    to continuous ceramic filaments obtained either from a multifilament bundle or
    spool. This method is not suitable for the ceramic filaments with creep behavior
    at test temperature. The hot grip technique is limited by the temperature resistance
    of the current ceramic adhesive.
