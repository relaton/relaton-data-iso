abstract:
- content: "This document defines measuring methods for the determination of basic
    measurements of surgical standard instruments. This document does not apply to
    instruments for use on the central nervous system and on the central cardiovascular
    system.\nNOTE 1\tInstruments for use on the central nervous system and on the
    central cardiovascular system are measured differently due to complex geometries
    which are adapted to the human anatomy.\nNOTE 2\tIn Annex A provides tables for
    converting customary units."
