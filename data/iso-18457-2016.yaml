    ISO 18457:2016 provides a framework of biomimetics for the development of materials, structures, surfaces, components, and manufacturing technologies.
    ISO 18457:2016 specifies the principles of biological systems, and especially the performance of biological materials, structures, surfaces, components, and manufacturing technologies that provide the motivation and reasons for biomimetic approaches. It specifies the methodology based on analysis of biological systems, which lead to analogies, and abstractions. The transfer process from biology to technology is described based on examples of biomimetic materials, structures, surfaces, components, and manufacturing technologies. This International Standard describes measurement methods and parameters for the characterization of properties of biomimetic materials. This International Standard provides information on the relevance of biomimetic materials, structures, surfaces, components, and manufacturing technologies for industry.
    ISO 18457:2016 also links to other subareas in biomimetics because fundamental developments in materials, structures, surfaces, components, and manufacturing technologies often form the basis for a wide variety of additional innovations. It provides guidance and support for all those who develop, design, process, or use biomimetic materials, structures, surfaces, components, and manufacturing technologies. This International Standard can also serve for those who want to learn about and investigate these topics.
