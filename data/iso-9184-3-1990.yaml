abstract:
- content: This part specifies the preparation, use and colour reactions of Herzberg
    stain. It should be used in conjunction with ISO 9184-1 and, if necessary, with
    other staining tests defined in ISO 9184-2. The Herzberg staining test is applicable
    to the qualitative and quantitative differentiation between chemical, mechanical
    and rag pulps. The stain also permits the qualitative identification of semi-chemical
    pulp as well as the differentiation between regenerated cellulose fibres (viscose,
    etc.) and synthetic fibres.
