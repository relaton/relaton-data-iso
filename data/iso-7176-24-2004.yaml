    ISO 7176-24:2004 is applicable to user-operated stair-climbing chairs and user-operated stair-climbing wheelchair carriers where the stair-climbing device climbs backwards up the stairs, with the user facing downstairs, and climbs down the stairs in a forward position with the user facing downstairs.
    ISO 7176-24:2004 specifies requirements and test methods for electrically powered stair-climbing devices that are user-operated. It also includes ergonomic, labelling and disclosure requirements.
    ISO 7176-24:2004 specifies tests to demonstrate the stair-climbing device's ability to perform safely on stairs with a pitch of 35°, or higher if claimed by the manufacturer.
