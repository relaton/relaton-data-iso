abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 21000-6:2004 describes a Rights Data Dictionary which comprises
    a set of clear, consistent, structured, integrated and uniquely identified terms
    to support the MPEG-21 Rights Expression Language (REL), ISO/IEC 21000-5. Annex
    A specifies the methodology for and structure of the RDD Dictionary, and specifies
    how further Terms may be defined under the governance of a Registration Authority,
    requirements for which are described in Annex C. \nTaken together, these specifications
    and the RDD Dictionary and Database make up the RDD System. Use of the RDD System
    will facilitate the accurate exchange and processing of information between interested
    parties involved in the administration of rights in, and use of, Digital Items,
    and in particular it is intended to support ISO/IEC 21000-5 (REL). Clause 6 describes
    how ISO/IEC 21000-6:2004 relates to ISO/IEC 21000-5.\nAs well as providing definitions
    of terms for use in ISO/IEC 21000-5, the RDD System is designed to support the
    mapping of terms from different namespaces. Such mapping will enable the transformation
    of metadata from the terminology of one namespace (or Authority) into that of
    another namespace. Mapping, to ensure minimum ambiguity or loss of semantic integrity,
    will be the responsibility of the Registration Authority. Provision of automated
    trm look-up is also a requirement.\nThe RDD Dictionary is a prescriptive dctionary,
    in the sense that it defines a single meaning for a trm represented by a particular
    RddAuthorized TermName, but it is also inclusive in that it can recognize the
    prescription of other Headwords and definitions by other Authorities and incorporates
    them through mappings. The RDD Dictionary also supports the circumstance that
    the same name may have different meanings under different Authorities. ISO/IEC
    21000-6:2004describes audit provisions so that additions, amendments and deletions
    to Terms and their attributes can be tracked.\nISO/IEC 21000-6:2004 recognizes
    legal definitions as and only as Terms from other Authorities that can be mapped
    into the RDD Dictionary. Therefore Terms that are directly authorized by the RDD
    Registration Authority neither define nor prescribe intellectual property rights
    or other legal entities."
