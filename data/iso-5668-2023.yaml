- content: |-
    This document provides guidelines and requirements for the corrosion testing of metals and alloys in the simulated environment of deep-sea water, including principle, testing equipment, specimen preparation, testing procedure and evaluation after test. This document applies to the immersion testing, corrosion testing under stress condition and electrochemical testing in the simulated environment of deep-sea water in the laboratory.
    Testing of other materials such as composites and elastomers can also be carried out in the simulated environment of deep-sea water with reference to this document, but the evaluation of these materials after the testing is different from that of metals and alloys.
