abstract:
- content: "This document establishes requirements and guidance for clients working
    with one or more service provider(s) to carry out the assessment of an individual,
    a group or an organization for work-related purposes. This document enables the
    client to base its decisions on sound assessment results.\nThis document specifies
    the requirements of the client with respect to:\na)   the needs and rationale
    for using assessments;\nb)   the conditions under which the assessment will be
    used;\nc)   the decisions about the assessment approach together with the implementation
    and evaluation of assessment procedures and methods;\nd)   the required competence
    and professionalism of any person working under its control with a role in the
    assessment process;\ne)   the decisions about the access, use and storage of assessment
    results and subsequent reports; \nf)    organizational decisions related to the
    delivery of assessment services.\nThis document also specifies assessment approaches
    and procedures that can be carried out for one or more work-related purposes made
    by or affecting individuals, groups or organizations, including, but not limited
    to:\n—     employment-related decisions (e.g. recruitment, selection, development,
    appraisal, promotion, outplacement, succession planning and reassignment);\n—
    \    career-related decisions (e.g. recruiting, coaching, guidance, vocational
    rehabilitation and outplacement counselling);\n—     group decisions (e.g. training
    initiatives, team building); \n—     organizational decisions (e.g. restructuring,
    morale and culture initiatives, mergers and acquisitions).\nNo detailed technical
    or professional specifications are included within this document; however, an
    explanation of some of the more common professional quality principles used in
    assessment (e.g. validity, reliability, fairness, standardization) are included
    in Annex B. Despite the informative nature of this annex, the quality of assessment
    procedures and methods is important to the client in relation to the purposes
    of the assessment, the relevance of the measures involved, their validity, reliability,
    fairness, standardization and any issues relating to special needs of the assessment
    participant and other factors that affect the practicality, acceptability and
    utility of the assessment.\nNOTE 1 Requirements for the service provider are specified
    in ISO 10667-2.\nNOTE 2 See Bibliography for examples of various professional
    guidelines and national standards.\nThis document does not detail the specific
    competences required for assessors as these are dependent upon the nature of the
    assessment.\nNOTE 3 See Annex C for further information on assessor competence."
