abstract:
- content: "The Open Test sequence eXchange (OTX) Core, defined in ISO 13209-2, describes
    the basic structure underlying every OTX document. ISO 13209-3:2012 extends the
    Core by a set of additional features, using the extension mechanism rules described
    in ISO 13209-2. The extensions defined in ISO 13209-3:2012 comprise features which
    allow diagnostic communication to a vehicle's diagnostic interface, flashing,
    executing diagnostic jobs, controlling measurement equipment, internationalization,
    working with physical units, accessing the environment, communication via a human
    machine interface (HMI) and other utility extensions. \nISO 13209-3:2012 defines
    the OTX extension requirements and data model specifications.\nThe requirements
    are derived from the use cases described in ISO 13209-1.\nThe data model specification
    aims at an exhaustive definition of all features of the OTX extensions which have
    been implemented to satisfy the requirements. ISO 13209-3:2012 establishes rules
    for the syntactical entities of each extension. Each of these syntactical entities
    is accompanied by semantic rules which determine how OTX documents containing
    extension features are to be interpreted. The syntax rules are provided by UML
    class diagrams and XML schemas, whereas the semantics are given by UML activity
    diagrams and prose definitions."
