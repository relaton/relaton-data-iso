- content: |-
    ISO/PAS 21100:2011 defines the minimum performance requirements and test parameters for air cargo unit load devices requiring approval of airworthiness for installation in an approved aircraft cargo compartment and restraint system that complies with the cargo restraint and occupant protection requirements of EASA CS-25 or of FAR Part 25, except for the 9,0g forward ultimate inertia force of § 25.561 (b) (3) (ii).
    ISO/PAS 21100:2011 applies to airworthiness approved air cargo unit load devices intended for carriage on board civil transport category airplanes of the type certificated under EASA CS-25 or FAR Part 25, or equivalent regulations.
    ISO/PAS 21100:2011 applies exclusively to unit load device airworthiness approval and testing parameters. It does not apply to either aircraft design or aircraft operating requirements, which are provided by the approved Weight and Balance Manual for each aircraft type.
