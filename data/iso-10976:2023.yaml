  content: This document establishes all necessary steps to properly measure and account
    for the quantities of cargoes on liquefied natural gas (LNG) carriers. This includes,
    but is not limited to, the measurement of liquid volume, vapour volume, temperature
    and pressure, and accounting for the total quantity of the cargo on board. This
    document describes the use of common measurement systems on board LNG carriers,
    the aim of which is to improve the general knowledge and processes in the measurement
    of LNG for all parties concerned. This document provides general requirements
    for those involved in the LNG trade on ships and onshore.
