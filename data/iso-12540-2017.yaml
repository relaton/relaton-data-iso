    ISO 12540:2017 covers product definitions, product characteristics, i.e. tolerances, flatness, edgework, etc., fracture characteristics, including fragmentation, and the physical and mechanical characteristics of flat tempered soda lime silicate safety glass for use in buildings.
    ISO 12540:2017 does not cover curved (bent) glass according to ISO 11485.
    Other requirements, not specified in this document, can apply to thermally toughened soda lime silicate safety glass which is incorporated into assemblies, e.g. laminated glass or insulating glass units, or undergo an additional treatment, e.g. coating. The additional requirements are specified in the appropriate glass product standard. Thermally toughened soda lime silicate safety glass, in this case, does not lose its mechanical or thermal characteristics.
