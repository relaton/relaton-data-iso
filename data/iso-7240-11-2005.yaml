    ISO 7240-11:2005 specifies the requirements, test methods and performance criteria for manual call points in fire detection and fire alarm systems in and around buildings. ISO 7240-11:2005 takes into account indoor and outdoor conditions, the appearance and operation of the manual call points for type A "direct operation" and type B "indirect operation" and covers those which are simple mechanical switches, those which are fitted with simple electronic components (e.g. resistors, diodes) and those which contain active electronic components and which work with the control and indicating equipment for signalling and identifying, for example, an address or location.
    ISO 7240-11:2005 does not cover manual call points for special applications, for example manual call points that are intrinsically safe or for use in hazardous conditions, if such applications require additional or other requirements or tests.
