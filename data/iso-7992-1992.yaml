  content: 'Specifies a method for evaluating the physical stability of iron ores
    reduced under load and under specific conditions. The specific conditions are:
    isothermal heating for reduction, a test portion having a specified size and placed
    in a fixed bed under load, a reducing gas composed of a carbon monoxide/hydrogen/nitrogen
    mixture, measurement of the differential gas pressure across a bed of the test
    portion and measurement of the change in the height of the bed. Applies to sized
    ores and pellets. Annex A gives the flowsheet of the procedure for the acceptance
    of test results.'
