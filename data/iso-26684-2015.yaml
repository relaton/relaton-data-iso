abstract:
- content: "ISO 26684:2015 specifies the concept of operation, system requirements,
    and test methods for cooperative intersection signal information and violation
    warning systems (CIWS) at signalized intersections. CIWS are intended to reduce
    the likelihood of crash injury, damage, and fatality by enhancing the capability
    of drivers to avoid crash situations at signalized intersections. \nThe scope
    of CIWS standardization includes basic functions, functional requirements, performance
    requirements, information contents, and test methods.\nThe characteristics of
    the technologies used to communicate between the signal controller and the vehicles
    are not addressed by this International Standard nor are the behavioural responses
    by drivers, the various capabilities of vehicles on the road, or the multitude
    of combinations of these two characteristics."
