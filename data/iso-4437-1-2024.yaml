- content: |-
    This document specifies materials and the general aspects of polyethylene (PE) piping systems in the field of the supply of gaseous fuels.
    It also specifies the test parameters for the test methods referred to in this document.
    In conjunction with ISO 4437-2, ISO 4437-3, ISO 4437-4 and ISO 4437-5, this document is applicable to PE pipes, fittings and valves, their joints, and joints with components of PE and other materials intended to be used under the following conditions:
    a)       a maximum operating pressure (MOP) up to and including 10 bar[1], at a reference temperature of 20 °C for design purposes;
    b)       an operating temperature between −20 °C and 40 °C.
    For operating temperatures between 20 °C and 40 °C, derating coefficients are defined in ISO 4437-5.
    The ISO 4437 series covers a range of MOPs and gives requirements concerning colours.
    It is the responsibility of the purchaser or specifier to make the appropriate selections from these aspects, taking into account their particular requirements and any relevant national regulations and installation practices or codes.
