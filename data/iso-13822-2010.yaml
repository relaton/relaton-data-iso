    ISO 13822:2010 provides general requirements and procedures for the assessment of existing structures (buildings, bridges, industrial structures, etc.) based on the principles of structural reliability and consequences of failure. It is based on ISO 2394.
    ISO 13822:2010 is applicable to the assessment of any type of existing structure that was originally designed, analysed and specified based on accepted engineering principles and/or design rules, as well as structures constructed on the basis of good workmanship, historic experience and accepted professional practice.
    The assessment can be initiated under the following circumstances: an anticipated change in use or extension of design working life; a reliability check (e.g. for earthquakes, increased traffic actions) as required by authorities, insurance companies, owners, etc.; structural deterioration due to time-dependent actions (e.g. corrosion, fatigue); structural damage by accidental actions (see ISO 2394).
    ISO 13822:2010 is also applicable to heritage structures provided additional considerations shown in Annex I are taken into account.
    ISO 13822:2010 is applicable to existing structures of any material, although specific adaptation can be required depending on the type of material, such as concrete, steel, timber, masonry, etc.
    ISO 13822:2010 provides principles regarding actions and environmental influences. Further detailed considerations are necessary for accidental actions such as fire and earthquake.
    ISO 13822:2010 is intended to serve as a basis for preparing national standards or codes of practice in accordance with current engineering practice and the economic conditions.
