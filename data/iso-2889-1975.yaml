abstract:
- content: Sets forth the principles for collecting representative samples and prescribes
    acceptable methods and materials for gas and particle sampling (collection of
    the samples, and not their measurement), limited to sampling in installations
    where work with radioactive materials is conducted, including sampling effluent
    gases prior to, or at, the point of release to the atmosphere, and with the primary
    emphasis on the need to protect the radiation worker. Does not consider application
    of various collectors to specific problems.
