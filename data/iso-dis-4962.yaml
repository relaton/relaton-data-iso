abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "This document specifies a procedure to evaluate phototoxicity of nanoparticles
    (NPs), suspended in an aqueous environment, by measuring the relative reduction
    in cellular viability under near ultraviolet (UVA) irradiation.  \nThe measurement
    is intended to assess the potential for acute photo-toxicity of nanomaterials.
    It is not designed to predict other joint effects of nanomaterials and light,
    such as genotoxicity, photoallergy or photomutagenicity. The method is also applicable
    to NP aggregates and agglomerates."
