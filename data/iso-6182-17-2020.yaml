  content: This document specifies performance requirements, methods of test and marking
    requirements for pressure reducing valves intended to reduce the downstream water
    pressure in the piping for water-based fire protection systems. Within the context
    of this document, pressure reducing valves include both pilot operated pressure
    reducing valves and direct acting pressure reducing valves. Performance and test
    requirements for other auxiliary components or attachments to pressure reducing
    valves are not within the scope of this document.
