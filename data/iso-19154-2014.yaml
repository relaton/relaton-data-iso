- content: |-
    ISO 19154:2014 defines a reference model for ubiquitous public access (UPA) to geographic information. This reference model uses standard concepts from both the Open distributed processing ? Reference model (RM-ODP) in ISO/IEC 10746‑1 and ISO 19101.
    The reference model specified in ISO 19154:2014 defines the following:
    ?   conceptual models for ubiquitous public access (UPA) to geographic information;
    ?   a reference model and framework to support current and future specification development in this area;
    ?   the semantics of information and processing within systems and services for the UPA of geographic information;
    ?   the architectural relationship between this International Standard and other ISO geographic information standards.
    ISO 19154 is applicable to location-based services (LBS), ubiquitous computing environments, linked open data, and other domains that require a seamless public access to geographic information.
    Although structured in the context of information technology and information technology standards, ISO 19154:2014 is independent of any application development method or technology implementation approach.
