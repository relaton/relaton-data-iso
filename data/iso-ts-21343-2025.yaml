    This document specifies requirements and guidance for manufacturers of ammonia-fired boilers regarding functional tests performed at the time of design and on-site acceptance tests, in order to meet the required environmental performance.
    This document stipulates the test methods, the measurement items, the evaluation methods and the test reports for each test.
    This document is applicable to:
    a)       land boilers used for power generation with an electrical output of 100 MWe or more;
    b)       equipment that uses NH3 of any mixing ratio as fuel;
    c)        boilers with burners for combustion of fuel.
    This document does not apply to heat recovery steam generators for gas turbines, fluidized bed boiler, stokers, black liquor recovery boiler and process heat transfer equipment (used in petroleum refining).
