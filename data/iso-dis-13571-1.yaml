  content: This International Standard is one of many tools available for use in fire
    safety engineering. It is intended to be used in conjunction with models for analysis
    of the initiation and development of fire, fire spread, smoke formation and movement,
    chemical species generation, transport and decay, and people movement, as well
    as fire detection and suppression. This International Standard is to be used only
    within this context.
