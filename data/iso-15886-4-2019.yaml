    This document specifies the conditions and methods for testing the durability of rotating sprinklers for irrigation.
    The term sprinkler is used here in a broad generic sense and is meant to cover a wide variety of products as classified in ISO 15886-1, which applies to all irrigation sprinkler classifications having both static parts and moving parts during operation, as defined by the manufacturer.
    For any given sprinkler, a wide range of nozzle configurations, operating conditions, and adjustments generates at least a theoretical need for a correspondingly large number of tests. Testing agencies and manufacturers can use interpolation techniques to reduce the number of actual test runs, provided accuracy standards are still being met.
