    This document applies to nuclear power plants with water cooled reactors. For other nuclear facilities check the applicability of the document in advance, before it might be applied correspondingly.
    This document specifies the requirements for the earthquake safety of components. The operation-specific safety-related requirements for each component, e.g. load-bearing capacity (stability), integrity and functionality (see 4.1) are not the subject of this document. With regard to analysing the mechanical behaviour of the individual components and verifying the fulfillment of their safety related functions, additionally, the respective component-specific standards need to be consulted.
    In this document, the term "mechanical components" refers to components such as vessels, heat exchangers, pumps, valves, lifting gear, distribution systems and pipe lines including their support structures in as far as these components are not considered to be civil structures in accordance with ISO 4917-3. Liners, crane runways, platforms and scaffoldings are not considered as being part of these mechanical components.
    In this document, the term electrical components refers to the combination of electrical devices including all electrical connections and their support structures (e.g. cabinets, frames, consoles, brackets, suspensions or supports).
    Supplementary to this document the seismic qualification of electrical components is reported in IEC/IEEE 60980-344.
    NOTE          This document is independent of national standards. Recommendations, given in Annex A, are mainly based on the Eurocodes-Design-Philosophy and European Standards. Alternatively other equivalent standards or regulations can be used in case the general requirements given in this document together with Annex A can be met.
