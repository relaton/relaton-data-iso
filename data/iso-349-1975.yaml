abstract:
- content: Specifies a method for determining the swelling properties of hard coal
    when heated under standard conditions in a dilatometer. In performing the method
    a pencil made of powdered coal formed under pressure is inserted into a precisely
    calibrated narrow tube and topped by a calibrated steel rod which slides in the
    bore of the tube. The whole is heated at a constant and definite rate. By making
    regular readings of the displacement of the rod as a function of the temperature
    and expressing the displacements observed as percentages of the original length
    of the penicl a curve is plotted.
