  content: "The document specifies a reference architecture for event-based syndromic
    surveillance systems for infectious diseases. The reference architecture addresses
    concepts, data sources, architectural components, and outputs. \nFrom the perspective
    of the diagnostic process, this document covers the processes from the symptom-onset
    stage to the health-behaviour stage, which is prior to the healthcare-encounter
    stage. \nNon-infectious health hazards like natural disasters, human-induced emergencies,
    and chronic diseases. and their associated surveillance systems are beyond the
    scope of this specification"
