    ISO/TS 37151:2015 gives principles and specifies requirements for the
    ·         definition,
    ·         identification,
    ·         optimization, and
    ·         harmonization
    of community infrastructure performance metrics, and gives recommendations for analysis, including
    ·         smartness,
    ·         interoperability,
    ·         synergy,
    ·         resilience,
    ·         safety, and
    ·         security
    of community infrastructures.
    Community infrastructures include, but are not limited to, energy, water, transportation, waste, and ICT.
    The principles and requirements of ISO/TS 37151:2015 are applicable to communities of any size sharing geographic areas that are planning, commissioning, managing, and assessing all or any element of its community infrastructures. However, the selection and the importance of metrics or (key) performance indicators of community infrastructures is a result of the application of ISO/TS 37151:2015 and depends on the characteristics of each community.
    In ISO/TS 37151:2015, the concept of smartness is addressed in terms of performance relevant to technologically implementable solutions, in accordance with sustainable development and resilience of communities as defined in ISO/TC 268.
