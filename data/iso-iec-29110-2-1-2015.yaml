abstract:
- content: "1.1   Fields of application  \nISO/IEC 29110-2-1:2015 is applicable to
    Very Small Entities (VSEs). The lifecycle processes described in ISO/IEC 29110
    are not intended to preclude or discourage their use by organizations bigger than
    VSEs. However, certain issues faced by large organizations might not be covered
    by ISO/IEC 29110.\nThe lifecycle processes defined in ISO/IEC 29110 can be used
    by VSEs when acquiring and using, as well as when creating and supplying, a software,
    and systems. They can be applied at any level in a software and systems structure
    and at any stage in the lifecycle. The processes described in ISO/IEC 29110 are
    not intended to preclude or discourage the use of additional processes that VSEs
    find useful.\nISO/IEC 29110-2-1:2015 introduces the major concepts for software
    and systems engineering profiles for VSEs, and defines the terms common to the
    set of documents associated with VSE profiles.\nIt establishes the logic behind
    the definition and application of profiles. It specifies the elements common to
    all standardized profiles (structure, conformance, assessment).\nISO/IEC 29110-2-1:2015
    is applicable to all profiles.\nISO/IEC 29110-2-1:2015 is targeted at authors
    and reviewers of standardized profiles, authors of other parts, and authors of
    other VSE profiles."
