    This part of ISO 10333 specifies requirements, test methods, instructions for use and maintenance, marking,
    labelling and packaging, as appropriate, for lanyards and energy absorbers.
    Lanyards and energy absorbers are used together as a connecting subsystem in personal fall-arrest systems
    (PFAS) which will be specified in a future International Standard (see ISO 10333-6 in the Bibliography).
    Two classes of energy absorbers are specified for the purposes of this part of ISO 10333:
    a) Type 1: used in PFAS where, due to installation, the potential free-fall distance can be limited to a maximum
    of 1,8 m and, if a fall takes place, the arresting force is limited to a maximum of 4,0 kN;
    b) Type 2: used in PFAS where, due to installation, the potential free-fall distance can be limited to a maximum
    of 4,0 m and, if a fall takes place, the arresting force is limited to a maximum of 6,0 kN.
    This part of ISO 10333 is applicable only to lanyards and energy absorbers limited to single-person use of a total
    mass not exceeding 100 kg.
    NOTE Users of fall-protection equipment whose total mass (including tools and equipment) exceeds 100 kg are advised to
    seek advice from the equipment manufacturer regarding the suitability of this equipment, which may need additional testing.
    For the purposes of this part of ISO 10333, energy absorbers may be supplied integral to a lanyard, integral to a full
    body harness (FBH), or may be supplied separately.
    The scope of this part of ISO 10333 does not extend to:
    a) PFAS that incorporate lanyards without energy absorbers or without a means of energy dissipation;
    b) special lanyards and energy absorbers which are integral (i.e. can only be separated by mutilation or by
    special tool) to the PFAS components as specified in ISO 10333-4.
    This part of ISO 10333 does not specify those additional requirements that would apply when lanyards and energy
    absorbers are subjected to special conditions of use (where, for example, there exist unusual limitations concerning
    access to the place of work and/or particular environmental factors). Thus treatments to ensure the durability of the
    materials of construction (such as heat treatment, anti-corrosion treatment, protection against physical and
    chemical hazards) are not specified in this part of ISO 10333, but should comply with appropriate International
    Standards or, failing that, with national standards and other specifications dealing with relevant physical
    characteristics and/or the safety of users. In particular, when it is considered necessary to test the corrosion
    resistance of metallic parts of the equipment, reference should be made to ISO 9227.
