abstract:
- content: |-
    This document establishes procedures for the spatially resolved spectral measurement of reflecting flat objects, including inline colour measurements. It also establishes procedures for computation of colorimetric parameters for graphic arts multispectral imaging devices.
    Graphic arts includes, but is not limited to, the preparation of material for and volume production by production printing processes that include offset lithography, letterpress, flexography, gravure, screen and all kind of digital printing.
    This document does not address spatially resolved spectral measurements of transmitting or self-illuminating objects including flat-panel displays. This document is not applicable to step and repeat spot reading scanning instruments. It does not address printing on a metallic or interference foil.
