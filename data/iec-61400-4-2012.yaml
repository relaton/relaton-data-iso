  content: "IEC 61400-4:2012(E) is applicable to enclosed speed increasing gearboxes
    for horizontal axis wind turbine drivetrains with a power rating in excess of
    500 kW. This standard applies to wind turbines installed onshore or offshore.
    It Standard provides guidance on the analysis of the wind turbine loads in relation
    to the design of the gear and gearbox elements. The gearing elements covered by
    this standard include such gears as spur, helical or double helical and their
    combinations in parallel and epicyclic arrangements in the main power path. The
    standard is based on gearbox designs using   \nrolling element bearings. Also
    included is guidance on the engineering of shafts, shaft hub interfaces, bearings
    and the gear case structure in the development of a fully integrated design that
    meets the rigours of the operating conditions. Lubrication of the transmission
    is covered along with prototype and production testing. Finally, guidance is provided
    on the operation and maintenance of the gearbox."
