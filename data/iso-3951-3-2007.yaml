  content: "ISO 3951-3:2007 specifies an acceptance sampling system of double sampling
    schemes for inspection by variables for percent nonconforming. It is indexed in
    terms of the acceptance quality limit (AQL).\nThe objectives of the methods laid
    down in ISO 3951-3:2007 are to ensure that lots of acceptable quality have a high
    probability of acceptance and that the probability of non-accepting inferior lots
    is as high as practicable. This is achieved by means of the switching rules, which
    provide automatic protection to the consumer (by means of a switch to tightened
    inspection or discontinuation of sampling inspection) should a deterioration in
    quality be detected, and an incentive (at the discretion of the responsible authority)
    to reduce inspection costs (by means of a switch to a smaller sample size) should
    consistently good quality be achieved.\nIn ISO 3951-3:2007, the acceptability
    of a lot is implicitly or explicitly determined from an estimate of the percentage
    of nonconforming items in the process, based on either one or two random samples
    of items from the lot.\nISO 3951-3:2007 is primarily designed for use under the
    following conditions: where the inspection procedure is to be applied to a continuing
    series of lots of discrete products all supplied by one producer using one production
    process; where the items of product have a single quality characteristic; where
    the quality characteristic is measurable on a continuous scale; where the measurement
    error is negligible (i.e. with a standard deviation no more than 10 % of the corresponding
    process standard deviation); where production is stable (under statistical control)
    and the quality characteristic is distributed, at least to a close approximation,
    according to a normal distribution; where the possibility of having to select
    and inspect a second sample is administratively acceptable; and where a contract
    or standard defines an upper specification limit, a lower specification limit,
    or both on the quality characteristic. \nThe procedures in ISO 3951-3:2007 are
    not suitable for application to lots that have been screened previously for nonconforming
    items."
