abstract:
- content: 'ISO 22028-1:2004 specifies a set of requirements to be met by any extended-gamut
    colour encoding that is to be used for digital photography and/or graphic technology
    applications involving digital image storage, manipulation and/or interchange.
    ISO 22028-1:2004 is applicable to pictorial digital images that originate from
    an original scene, as well as digital images with content such as text, line art,
    vector graphics and other forms of original artwork. ISO 22028-1:2004 also describes
    a reference image-state-based digital imaging architecture, encompassing many
    common workflows, that can be used to classify extended colour encodings into
    a number of different image states. However, ISO 22028-1:2004 does not specify
    any particular workflow(s) that are to be used for digital photography and/or
    graphic technology applications. '
