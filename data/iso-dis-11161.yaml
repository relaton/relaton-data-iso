abstract:
- content: This document specifies the safety requirements for the integration of
    machinery into a system. It gives requirements and recommendations for inherently
    safe design, safeguarding and information for the use of an IMS. This document
    is not intended to cover safety aspects of individual machines and equipment that
    can be covered by standards specific to those machines and equipment. Therefore,
    it deals only with those safety aspects that are important for the safety-relevant
    interconnection of the machines and components. Where component machines of an
    integrated machinery system are operated separately or individually, the safety
    requirements of the relevant safety standards for these machines and equipment
    apply. This document is also applicable when a modification of an existing IMS
    results in a new configuration, function, capability or location.
