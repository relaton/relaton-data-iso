  content: Identifies the typical parameters of a component that permit it to be characterized
    unequivocally and to allow the corresponding reliability data to be associated
    with those of other components having equivalent typical parameters. Parameters
    refer to technical characteristics including the physical principle of operation
    and quality level and to actual operating conditions and maintenance and test
    intervals. Data may be represented both in a historical and in a statistical form.
