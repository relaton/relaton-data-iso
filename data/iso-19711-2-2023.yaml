    This document specifies the safety requirements for truck mixers defined in ISO19711-1.
    This document does not deal with carrier vehicles, e.g. trucks, tractors, construction machinery and mobile industrial handling equipment or other self-propelled vehicles.
    This document does not include requirements which are covered in directives related to the construction of vehicles or national road regulations.
    NOTE            The use in public road traffic is governed by the national regulations.
    This document deals with all significant hazards, hazardous situations and events relevant to truck mixers when they are used as intended and under the conditions of misuse which are reasonably foreseeable by the manufacturer (see Annex D). This document specifies the appropriate technical measures to eliminate or reduce risks arising from the significant hazards during transportation, assembly, dismantling, disabling, scrapping, operation and maintenance of the truck mixer.
    Figures to show examples in this document are listed in Annex A.
