abstract:
- content: "ISO 10302-1:2011 specifies methods for measuring the airborne noise emitted
    by small air-moving devices (AMDs), such as those used for cooling electronic,
    electrical, and mechanical equipment where the sound power level of the AMD is
    of interest. \nExamples of these AMDs include propeller fans, tube-axial fans,
    vane-axial fans, centrifugal fans, motorized impellers, and their variations.\nISO
    10302-1:2011 describes the test apparatus and methods for determining the airborne
    noise emitted by small AMDs as a function of the volume flow rate and the fan
    static pressure developed by the AMD on the test apparatus. It is intended for
    use by AMD manufacturers, by manufacturers who use AMDs for cooling electronic
    equipment and similar applications, and by testing laboratories. It provides a
    method for AMD manufacturers, equipment manufacturers and testing laboratories
    to obtain comparable results. Results of measurements made in accordance with
    ISO 10302-1:2011 are expected to be used for engineering information and performance
    verification, and the methods can be cited in purchase specifications and contracts
    between buyers and sellers. The ultimate purpose of the measurements is to provide
    data to assist the designers of electronic, electrical or mechanical equipment
    which contains one or more AMDs.\nBased on experimental data, a method is given
    for calculating the maximum volume flow rate of the scaled plenum up to which
    ISO 10302-1:2011 is applicable."
