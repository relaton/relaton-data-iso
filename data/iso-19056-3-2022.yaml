    This document specifies procedures for the measurement of illumination brightness, temporal stability and uniformity for incident light fluorescence microscopy. The measurement for uniformity is defined in image planes or intermediate image planes only, when these planes are suitable for detection by electronic imaging devices.
    This document defines how illumination brightness, temporal stability and uniformity are measured, and how this information is provided to the user.
    NOTE      The scope is intentionally limited to electronic imaging devices and (intermediate) image planes. The visual observation by means of eyepieces would require a different measurement procedure and hence result in ambiguities in the description of measurement procedures. Nevertheless, this document will give useful estimates for the uniformity with visual observation as in this case an eyepiece is used to observe an intermediate image plane (which is under the scope of this document).
