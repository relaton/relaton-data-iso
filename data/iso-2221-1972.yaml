abstract:
- content: The method, as specified, is applicable when the required limit is not
    greater than 0,05 % and not less than 0,0005 %. If the required limit lies outside
    that range, the mass of the test portion should be changed. The principle of the
    test consists in comparison of the turbidity obtained by the addition of silver
    nitrate solution to a solution of the sample, in the presence of nitric acid,
    with that similary produced from a chloride solution of known concentration.
