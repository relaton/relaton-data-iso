abstract:
- content: Applicable to products the content of which, expressed as sulphate, is
    equal to or more than 0.0005 % (m/m). Heating of a test portion in the presence
    of sodium carbonate, in a fume-cupboard, until the ammonium salts have been eliminated
    (about 300 °C). Reduction of the sulphureous residue to sulphides by a mixture
    of hydriodic acid and hypophosphorus acid. Absorption of the hydrogen sulphide
    evolved in a mixture of sodium hydroxide solution and acetone. Titration of the
    sulphide with standard volumetric mercury(II) acetate solution in the presence
    of dithizone as indicator. A typical apparatus for reduction and distillation
    is shown in a figure.
