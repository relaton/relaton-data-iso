  content: "ISO/IEC 24771:2014 defines a protocol for the physical layer (PHY) and
    the data link layer in order to construct a reliable and high-speed data transmission
    network between devices on industrial sites such as factories and plants. This
    network specification provides a standardized protocol to provide a framework
    for various industrial devices to establish a simple, low-cost, energy-efficient,
    and high-speed network between them. In order to fulfil the service requirements
    of the factories and large plants, this network specification is designed to enable
    devices to establish a network by themselves without help of any infrastructure
    and reliably exchange various kinds of data, including real-time audio and video
    data, between them. In addition to high transmission rates, Quality of Service
    (QoS) for multimedia data - such as video - is also provided. \nThe devices mentioned
    in ISO/IEC 24771:2014 refer to equipment that is and can be used in industrial
    sites such as factories and automated assembly lines. Such devices include PLC
    (Programmable Logic Controller), and CNC (Computerized Numerical Controller) and
    manufacturing robots. However, beyond such conventional devices, devices mentioned
    in this International Standard include personal IT devices that workers may carry
    and use while working, including cellular phones, personal industrial digital
    assistants (PDA), and laptop PCs."
