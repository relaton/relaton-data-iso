    This part of ISO 14132 applies to telescopic sights used on hand-held firearms and airguns and gives terms and definitions for telescopic sights only.
    The alphabetical indexes of terms in English, French, Russian, and German that are common for all published parts of ISO 14132 are published in ISO 14132‑1.
    The definitions can be changed, if required, by introducing derivative attributes into them, revealing the meanings of the terms used, showing the objects covered by the scope of the notion being defined. These changes will not affect the scope and contents of this part of ISO 14132.
    NOTE          In addition to terms used in the three official ISO languages (English, French, and Russian), this part of ISO 14132 gives the equivalent terms and definitions in the German language; these are published under the responsibility of the member body for Germany (DIN). However, only the terms and definitions given in the official languages can be considered as ISO terms and definitions.
