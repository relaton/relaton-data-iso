    ISO 28564-2:2016 gives a range of guidelines for various stages of preparation, design, construction, inspection, updating and testing which comprise a location sign or a direction sign used in public places and working areas.
    ISO 28564-2:2016 is applicable to the design and use of location signs and direction signs used in all sorts of public places, such as shopping centres, stores, hospitals, bus and railway stations, airports, sporting, exhibition halls and entertainment complexes, urban areas, parks, gardens and countryside, public attractions, museums and commercial office buildings. The design and use of location signs and direction signs in working areas can also resort to the content for reference.
    It is not applicable to those sectors (for example, traffic signs on a public highway), which are subject to regulations or specified design principles. However, in a given public environment or within a wayfinding and signing design brief, public information sometimes needs to be associated with other messaging, so many of the principles contained in this part of ISO 28564 can be relevant in the planning of a coordinated scheme.
