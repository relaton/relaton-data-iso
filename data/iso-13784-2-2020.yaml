    This document specifies a test method for evaluating the reaction-to-fire performance of thermal insulating sandwich panel building systems for large rooms and the resulting flame spread on or within the thermal insulating sandwich panel building construction when it is exposed to heat from a simulated internal fire with flames impinging directly on its internal corner. The test method is not intended for evaluating a product's fire resistance.
    This document is applicable to both freestanding and self-supporting and frame-supported thermal insulating sandwich panel systems, but only to wall and ceiling or roof constructions.
