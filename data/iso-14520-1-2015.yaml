    ISO 14520-1:2015 specifies requirements and gives recommendations for the design, installation, testing, maintenance and safety of gaseous fire fighting systems in buildings, plants or other structures, and the characteristics of the various extinguishants and types of fire for which they are a suitable extinguishing medium.
    It covers total flooding systems primarily related to buildings, plants and other specific applications, utilizing electrically non-conducting gaseous fire extinguishants that do not leave a residue after discharge and for which there are sufficient data currently available to enable validation of performance and safety characteristics by an appropriate independent authority. This part of ISO 14520 is not applicable to explosion suppression.
    ISO 14520-1:2015 is not intended to indicate approval of the extinguishants listed therein by the appropriate authorities, as other extinguishants may be equally acceptable. CO2 is not included as it is covered by other International Standards.
