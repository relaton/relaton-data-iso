    This document establishes a method to determine and assess sound insulation performances of all transparent, translucent and opaque glass products, for basic, special basic or processed glass products, when intended to be used in glazed assemblies in buildings, and which exhibit properties of acoustic protection, either as a prime or supplementary characteristic.
    This document refers to laboratory measurement method described in ISO 10140-1:2021, Annex D and defines extension rules that can be applied without further testing. It also provides typical performance data for a range of common glass products that can be used in the absence of measured data.
    All the considerations of this document relate to panes of glass or glass products alone. Incorporation of them into windows can cause changes in acoustic performance as a result of other influences, e.g. frame design, frame material, glazing material or method, mounting method, air tightness. Measurements of the sound insulation of complete windows (glass and frame) can be undertaken to resolve such issues.
