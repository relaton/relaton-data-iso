    10303-1620:2006 deals with the representation of interconnect physical requirements.\n
    \           This data includes all information related to shape and position requirements.
    Trace, via and\n            other passage spacing, keepin, keepout, etc. is included.
    Explicit allowed volumetric shape, required\n            connection locations,
    material specifications, etc. are included. Those layout items whose\n            placement
    is driven by thermal considerations or electromagnetic interference may be specified.\n
    \           Configuration management information and design change management
    information is provided. This\n            data includes at least one geometric
    representation.\n            \t\n         \nThe following are within the scope
    of \n         ISO/TS 10303-1620:2006:\n- shape based requirements allocated to
