abstract:
- content: "This document specifies a planning method for functional performance testing
    (FPT). This document is applicable to the planning of the FPT during the design
    phase of new buildings and retrofit projects, which is defined in ISO 16813.\nThis
    document establishes how to design building environmental systems when the FPT
    is being carried out. This document defines the following:\n—     what kind of
    information regarding the system is required (for example, design documents, drawings
    and product specifications);\n—     what kind of data should be measured (though
    concrete measurement techniques are not specified in this document);\n—     how
    the measured data is analysed.\nSuch clear definition of the FPT makes it possible
    for building designers to prepare and plan for FPT throughout the design process.\nThis
    document specifies an FPT method for secondary hydronic pump, system and associated
    controls in heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. "
