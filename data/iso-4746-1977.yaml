abstract:
- content: Provides a means of assessing the usability in electronic devices, for
    applications involving glass-to-metal seals, or other uses relying on the formation
    and presence of an adherent film of copper oxide. The procedure includes preparation
    and heating in air of a test piece, followed by rapid cooling in water and visual
    examination for loss of the oxide film or blistering.
