abstract:
- content: Slip resistance, expressed as the coefficient of friction of the footwear,
    is determined by placing the footwear on the testing surface (floor), with glycerine
    present as lubricant, applying a given load and either moving the footwear horizontally
    in relation to the surface or moving the surface in relation to the footwear.
    The frictional forces are measured and the dynamic coefficient of friction is
    calculated.
