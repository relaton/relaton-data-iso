abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: This document deals with the application of small-angle X-ray scattering
    (SAXS) for the measurement of the particle concentration in suspensions. In this
    document, only the concentration of sufficiently monodisperse spherical particles
    is treated, which means that the width of the size distribution is typically below
    about 50 % of the mean diameter. Here, the differential scattering cross section
    can be calculated based on the form factor, which depends only on the momentum
    transfer q and the particle radius r. Furthermore, this document is limited to
    dilute systems. A dilute system in the sense of SAXS means that particle interactions
    are absent. In case of long-range interactions (Coulomb forces between the particles),
    special care needs to be taken and a reduction of the concentration can be necessary.
