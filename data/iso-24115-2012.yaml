    This International Standard specifies a procedure for adjustment and subsequent calibration of moisture meters
    for green coffee beans with reference samples (RSs).
    The RSs are green coffee beans of various moisture contents, determined by a standard method (ISO 6673).
    NOTE This method of determining the loss in mass can be considered, by convention, as a method for determining
    the water content and can be used as such by agreement between the interested parties.
    This International Standard is applicable to green coffee as beans.
