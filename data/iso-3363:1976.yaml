  content: 'Applicable to products the acidity of which is between 2 mol and 200 mol
    of univalent acid per kg. Two procedures are given: one is applicable to liquid
    products (R11, R113, etc.) and the other one to gaseous (R12, R22, etc.). The
    principle consists in extraction of the acids by water. Titration of the acids
    in the aqueous phase with standard volumetric sodium hydroxide solution in the
    presence of bromocresol green as indicator. A figure shows an apparatus for absorption
    of acids for products which are gaseous at ordinary temperatures.'
