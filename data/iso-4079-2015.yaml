    ISO 4079:2015 specifies requirements for five types of textile-reinforced hydraulic hose and hose assembly of nominal size from 5 to 100. They are suitable for use with water-based hydraulic fluids HFC, HFAE, HFAS and HFB as defined in ISO 6743‑4 at temperatures ranging from −40 °C to +60 °C or oil-based hydraulic fluids HH, HL, HM, HR and HV as defined in ISO 6743‑4 at temperatures ranging from −40 °C to +100 °C.
    ISO 4079:2015 does not include requirements for end fittings. It is limited to requirements for hoses and hose assemblies.
    NOTE          It is the responsibility of the user, in consultation with the hose manufacturer, to establish compatibility of the hose with the fluid to be used.
