abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 24730-62:2013 defines the air-interface for real time locating
    \nsystems (RTLS) using a physical layer Ultra Wide Band (UWB) signalling mechanism
    \n(based on IEEE 802.15.4a UWB). This modulation scheme employs high rate pulse
    \nrepetition frequencies (PRF) 16 MHz or 64 MHz, and a combination of burst \nposition
    modulation (BPM) and binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) giving an \nextremely high
    level of performance with a fully coherent receiver.\nIn addition to defining
    the air interface protocol (AIP) in terms of the \nphysical layer modulation,
    ISO/IEC 24730-62:2013 also defines the AIP in terms \nof the messages sent over
    the air. This AIP supports simple one-way \ncommunication of a basic blink that
    may be used for a one-way Time Difference of \nArrival (TDOA) based RTLS, where
    mobile tags periodically transmit the blink \nmessage which is received by an
    infrastructure consisting of a number of fixed \nreader nodes.\nThis AIP also
    optionally supports bidirectional communication and two-way \nranging between
    the readers and tags of an RTLS. The support of two-way ranging \ndepends on additionally
    including a UWB receiver in the tag and UWB transmitters \nin the reader infrastructure.\nThe
    mandatory default operational mode ensures interoperability between tags \nand
    infrastructure from various manufacturers, while the availability of several \noptions
    offers flexibility to the developer of the infrastructure to adapt the \nbehaviour
    of the overall system to the specific needs of his \napplication."
