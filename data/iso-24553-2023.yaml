    This document provides ergonomic requirements and recommendations for increasing accessibility in terms of ease of operation through the design of products and controls of daily use. It is intended to aid the design of products and equipment that can be handled and manipulated easily and comfortably by people with the widest range of physical characteristics, capabilities and limitations across the widest age range.
    The requirements and recommendations specified in this document are based on general accessibility considerations as well as specific design considerations based on human physical characteristics, capabilities and limitations related to the operation of products and equipment, such as body size, strength, reach range and dexterity. Some considerations of cognitive factors are also presented.
    Products and equipment for professional use only, as well as those used only by technical experts, are not covered in this document. Design aspects related only to information and marking are not included.
    This document includes no general ergonomic requirements or recommendations for manual handling, working postures or safety of machinery but the contents are based on general knowledge of those issues.
    NOTE       ISO 11226, ISO 11228-1, ISO 11228-2, ISO 11228-3, EN 894-3+A1, EN 1005-2, EN 1005-3, EN 1005-4 and EN 1005-5 provide ergonomic requirements and recommendations for manual handling, working postures and safety of machinery.
