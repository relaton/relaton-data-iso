    ISO/IEC TR 10176:2003(E) provides guidelines for the preparation of Programming Language Standards.
    Standards for programming languages are developed by many committees from many countries, with many different editors supporting the effort. ISO thus considered it necessary to develop guidelines so that these standards cover at least the following subjects:
    Consistent terminology
    Consistent structure
    Syntax and semantics
    Error and exception handling
    Provisions of options
    Presentation of source programs
    Processor dependences
    Binding strategies to functional standards
    Conformance definition
    Internationalization and support of multiple languages
    Cultural convention related functionality
    Use of expanded character repertoire for identifiers
    User documentation
    The constant additions to ISO/IEC 10646, the Universal character set, necessitate timely updates of ISO/IEC TR 10176 to allow the use of local scripts and characters in programming languages. Annex A of ISO/IEC TR 10176:2003 provides such an expanded collection of characters, recommended for use in programming languages.
