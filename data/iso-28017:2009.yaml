    ISO 28017:2009 specifies requirements for two types, seven classes and three grades of wire- or textile-reinforced dredging hoses with nominal sizes ranging from 100 to 1 200. Within each class, all grades and sizes have the same maximum working pressure. Such hoses are suitable for the delivery or suction of seawater, freshwater, silt, sand, coral and small stones with a specific gravity in the range from 1,0 to 2,3 at temperatures ranging from -10 °C to +40 °C.
    This International Standard covers two types of hose, as follows:
    - type 1: floating type, for delivery only, which includes flotation material to give the hose buoyancy;
    - type 2: submarine type for delivery and suction.
    This International Standard does not specify requirements concerning the service life of hoses or hose assemblies. Specifying such requirements is the responsibility of the customer, in consultation with the hose manufacturer.
