  content: This document describes a test procedure for applying out-of-phase load
    cycles which generate forces in two directions, representative of those caused
    by traffic on railway track, taking into account the effect of two consecutive
    axles of passing railway vehicles. The document applies to surface mounted rail
    on sleepers, bearers and slab track. The test procedure applies to a complete
    fastening assembly.
