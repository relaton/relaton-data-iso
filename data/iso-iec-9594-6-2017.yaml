  script: Latn
  content: "ISO/IEC 9594-6:2017 defines a number of attribute types and matching rules
    which may be found useful across a range of applications of the Directory. \nAttribute
    types and matching rules fall into three categories, as described below. \nSome
    attribute types and matching rules are used by a wide variety of applications
    or are understood and/or used by the Directory itself.\nNOTE 1 - It is recommended
    that an attribute type or matching rule defined in this Recommendation | International
    Standard be used, in preference to the generation of a new one, whenever it is
    appropriate for the application. \nNOTE 2 - The attribute and context types definitions
    by this Recommendation | International Standard have some associated semantics.
    Such specifications should not be used in situations where these semantics do
    not apply.\nSome attribute types and matching rules are internationally standardized,
    but are application-specific. These are defined in the standards associated with
    the application concerned. \nAny administrative authority can define its own attribute
    types and matching rules for any purpose. These are not internationally standardized,
    and are available to others beyond the administrative authority which created
    them only through bilateral agreement."
