abstract:
- content: |-
    ISO 50002:2014 specifies the process requirements for carrying out an energy audit in relation to energy performance. It is applicable to all types of establishments and organizations, and all forms of energy and energy use.
    ISO 50002:2014 specifies the principles of carrying out energy audits, requirements for the common processes during energy audits, and deliverables for energy audits.
    ISO 50002:2014 does not address the requirements for selection and evaluation of the competence of bodies providing energy audit services, and it does not cover the auditing of an organization's energy management system, as these are described in ISO 50003.
    ISO 50002:2014 also provides informative guidance on its use.
