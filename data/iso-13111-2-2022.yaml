    This document defines the data exchange protocol used to implement use cases for applications based on the personal ITS station defined in ISO 13111-1, which provides and maintains ITS services to travellers, including drivers, passengers and pedestrians.
    The ITS applications supported by this document include multimodal transportation information services and multimodal navigation services that are based on personal ITS stations in various application scenarios defined in ISO 13111-1.
    The use case implementations described in this document refer to the architecture defined in ISO 21217 and ISO 13184.
