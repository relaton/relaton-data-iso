  content: ISO 14469-1:2004 specifies CNG refuelling nozzles and receptacles constructed
    entirely of new and unused parts and materials, for road vehicles powered by compressed
    natural gas. A CNG refuelling connector consists of, as applicable, the receptacle
    and its protective cap (mounted on the vehicle) and the nozzle. ISO 14469-1:2004
    is applicable only to such devices designed for a service pressure of 20 MPa (200
    bar), identified by the code B200, to those using CNG in accordance with ISO 15403
    and having standardized mating components, and to connectors that prevent natural
    gas vehicles from being fuelled by dispenser stations with service pressures higher
    than that of the vehicle, while allowing them to be fuelled by stations with service
    pressures less than or equal to the vehicle fuel system service pressure.
