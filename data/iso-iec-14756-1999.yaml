abstract:
- content: "This International Standard defines how user oriented performance of computer-based
    software systems (CBSS)\nmay be measured and rated. A CBSS is a data processing
    system as it is seen by its users, e.g. by users at various\nterminals, or as
    it is seen by operational users and business users at the data processing center.\nA
    CBSS includes hardware and all its software (system software and application software)
    which is needed to\nrealize the data processing functions required by the users
    or what may influence to the CBSS's time behaviour.\nThis International Standard
    is applicable for tests of all time constrained systems or system parts. Also
    a network\nmay be part of a system or may be the main subject of a test. The method
    defined in this International Standard is\nnot limited to special cases like classic
    batch or terminal-host systems, e.g. also included are client server systems\nor,
    with a broader comprehension of the definition of ?task', real time systems. But
    the practicability of tests may be\nlimited by the expenditure required to test
    large environments.\nThis International Standard specifies the key figures of
    user oriented performance terms and specifies a method of\nmeasuring and rating
    these performance values. The specified performance values are those which describe
    the\nexecution speed of user orders (tasks), namely the triple of:\n-  execution
    time,\n-  throughput,\n-  timeliness.\nThe user orders, subsequently called tasks,
    may be of simple or complex internal structure. A task may be a job,\ntransaction,
    process or a more complex structure, but with a defined start and end depending
    on the needs of the\nevaluator. When evaluating the performance it is possible
    to use this International Standard for measuring the time\nbehaviour with reference
    to business transaction completion times in addition to other individual response
    times.\nThe rating is done with respect to users requirements or by comparing
    two or more measured systems (types or\nversions).\nIntentionally no proposals
    for measuring internal values, such as:\n-  utilisation values,\n-  mean instruction
    rates,\n-  path lengths,\n-  cache hit rates,\n-  queuing times,\n-  service times,\n
    \nare given, because the definition of internal values depends on the architecture
    of the hardware and the software of\nthe system under test. Contrary to this the
    user oriented performance values which are defined in this International\nStandard
    are independent of architecture. The definition of internal performance values
    can be done independently\nfrom the definition of user oriented performance values.
    They may be used and can be measured in addition to the\nuser oriented performance
    values. Also the definition of terms for the efficiency with which the user oriented
    values\nare produced can be done freely. In addition this International Standard
    gives guidance on how to establish at a\ndata processing system a stable and reproducible
    state of operation. This reproducible state may be used to\nmeasure other performance
    values such as the above mentioned internal values.\nThis International Standard
    focuses on:\n-  application software;\n-  system software;\n-  turn-key systems
    (i.e. systems consisting of an application software, the system software and the\nhardware
    for which it was designed);\n-  general data processing systems.\nThis International
    Standard specifies the requirements for an emulation (by a technical system -
    the so-called\nremote terminal emulator (RTE) - of user interactions with a data
    processing system. It is the guideline for precisely\nmeasuring and rating the
    user oriented performance values. It provides the guideline for estimating these
    values\nwith the required accuracy and repeatability of CBSSs with deterministic
    as well as random behaviour of users. It is\nalso a guidance for implementing
    a RTE or proving whether it works according to this International Standard.\nThis
    International Standard provides the guideline to measure and rate the performance
    of CBSS with random user\nbehaviour when the accuracy and repeatability is required.
    It specifies in detail how to prepare and carry out the\nmeasurement procedure.
    Along with a description of the analysis of the measured values, the formulas
    for\ncomputing the performance value and the rating value, are provided.\nThis
    International Standard also gives guidance on:\n-  how to design a user oriented
    benchmark test using a:\n*  transaction oriented workload,\n*  batch oriented
    workload,\n*  or transaction and batch mixed workload.\nIt specifies:\n-  how
    to describe such a workload,\n-  how to perform the measurement procedure,\n-
    \ how to rate the measured results.\nThis International Standard is of interest
    to:\n-  evaluators,\n-  developers,\n-  buyers (including users of a data processing
    system),\n-  system integrators\nof CBSSs.\nNOTE 1 The field of application of
    this International Standard may be extended to include the following aspects.\nWorkloads
    fulfilling the specifications of this standard and having a sufficiently general
    structure may be used as standard\nworkloads. They may be used to measure and
    rate performance of data processing systems used in specific fields. E.g. a\nstandard
    workload for word-processing may be used to compare the time efficiency of different
    software products or\ndifferent versions of the same product running on the same
    hardware system. Such a standard workload may also be\nused if always applying
    the same application software version and the same hardware to compare the efficiency
    of the\nsystem software. When applying the same application software and workload
    to different systems, consisting of hardware\nand system software, as normally
    sold by system vendors, the efficiency of the data processing systems may be\ncompared
    with respect to the application and workload used."
