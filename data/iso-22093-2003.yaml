- content: |-
    The objective of ISO 22093:2003 is to provide a standard for the bi-directional communication of inspection data between computer systems and inspection equipment. The Dimensional Measuring Interface Standard (DMIS) is a vocabulary of terms, which establishes a neutral format for inspection programs and inspection results data.
    While primarily designed for communication between automated equipment, DMIS is designed to be both man-readable and man-writable, allowing inspection programs to be written and inspection results to be analyzed without the use of computer aids. With the enhancement of the High Level Language extensions, DMIS can function and be implemented as a DME language.
