    This document specifies test procedures for specimens obtained from round bamboo culms. The data obtained from the test methods can be used to establish characteristic physical or mechanical properties to be used in structural engineering design or for other scientific purposes. This document provides methods for evaluating the following physical and strength properties: moisture content, density, mass per unit length; strength properties parallel to the fibre direction, compression, tension and bending, and strength properties perpendicular to the fibre direction, tension and bending. It also provides methods to estimate moduli of elasticity in bending, compression and tension parallel to fibres, and bending perpendicular to fibres.
    The test methods reported in this document are intended for commercial testing applications. The test methods reported in this document are intended for commercial testing applications and can also be adopted as benchmark methods for scientific research.
    This document is organized to provide requirements for standard tests to be carried out to determine the material properties of full-culm bamboo as a structural material.
