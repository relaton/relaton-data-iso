    ISO 7183:2007 specifies the performance data that are necessary to state and applicable test methods for different types of compressed air dryers. It is applicable to compressed air dryers working with an effective (gauge) pressure of more than 50 kPa (0,5 bar), but less than or equal to 1 600 kPa (16 bar) and include the following: adsorption dryers, membrane dryers, refrigeration dryers (including drying by cooling) or a combination of these.
    A description is given of the principles of operation of the dryers within the scope of ISO 7183:2007.
    ISO 7183:2007 identifies test methods for measuring dryer parameters that include the following: pressure dew point, flow rate, pressure drop, compressed-air loss, power consumption and noise emission.
    ISO 7183:2007 also provides partial-load tests for determining the performance of energy saving devices or measures and describes the mounting, operating and loading conditions of dryers for the measurement of noise.
    ISO 7183:2007 is not applicable to the following types of dryers or drying processes: absorption dryers, drying by over-compression and integral dryers.
