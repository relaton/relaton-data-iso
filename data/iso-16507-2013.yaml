    ISO 16507:2013 is applicable to determining the resistance to deflection and damage of wood-based panels subjected to concentrated impact loads from nonrigid blunt objects, concentrated static loads, and uniformly distributed loads. Surface indentation is not evaluated separately from deflection.
    The procedures are intended to simulate loading on roof or floor sheathing materials installed directly to framing. Three applications are covered: roof sheathing, subfloors, and single floors. Panels are tested parallel and/or perpendicular to the panel strength axis. Roof sheathing is tested in both a dry and a wet condition, while subfloors and single floors are both tested in a dry condition, as well as a condition of having dried out after being wet. These moisture conditions are those commonly experienced with site-built construction.
    These procedures do not cover vibration and are not intended for the evaluation of the framed assembly as a whole.
