    ISO 22108:2008 describes the identification of critical non-flight items in space flight hardware and the procedure to account for their complete removal prior to flight. ISO 22108:2008 is used in context with project-specific quality requirements and procedures related to flight hardware and related activities prior to launch and at the launch site. Verification of removal of critical non-flight items is described in ISO 22108:2008.
    Removal of other non-flight items is outside the scope of ISO 22108:2008 and is verified by relevant inspection procedures.
