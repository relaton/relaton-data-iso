abstract:
- content: |-
    ISO 10845-6:2011 establishes a key performance indicator, in the form of a contract participation goal, relating to the engagement of targeted partners in a joint venture on a contract for the provision of goods, services or engineering and construction works. A contract participation goal may be used to measure the outcomes of a contract in relation to the engagement of targeted partners in a joint venture or to establish a target level of performance for the contractor to achieve or exceed in the performance of a contract.
    ISO 10845-6:2011 sets out the methods by which the key performance indicator can be measured, quantified and verified in the performance of the contract in respect of two different targeting strategies: targeting strategy A and targeting strategy B.
