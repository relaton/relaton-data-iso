  content: "The document concerns display systems, including their cover material,
    inside of a vehicle and with the purpose of providing vital information to the
    driver. \nThe display system may be located directly in front of the driver, in
    the middle section of the dashboard, or stretch from the driver’s side to the
    middle section. It relays information from the instrument cluster, navigation
    system, infotainment, and other information such as comfort and warning systems.\nThis
    document covers display systems in passenger cars (including sport utility vehicles
    and light trucks) and commercial vehicles (including heavy trucks and buses).
    \nStatic and dynamic laboratory tests and dynamic field operational assessment
    vehicle setup procedures to measure display and cover glass attributes are also
    included.\nOut of scope are any display systems with the sole purpose of entertaining
    passengers. The type of display device (e.g. LED, LCD, OLED) is not considered
    unless specifically called for."
