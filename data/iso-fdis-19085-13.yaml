    This document specifies the safety requirements and measures for multi-blade rip sawing machines with manual loading and/or unloading (defined in 3.1) capable of continuous production use, hereinafter referred to also as “machines”, designed to cut solid wood and materials with similar physical characteristics to wood.
    It deals with all significant hazards, hazardous situations and events as listed in Annex A, relevant to the machines, when operated, adjusted and maintained as intended and under the conditions foreseen by the manufacturer including reasonably foreseeable misuse. Transport, assembly, dismantling, disabling and scrapping phases are also taken into account.
    This document does not deal with specific hazards related to the combination of single machines with any other machine as part of a line.
    It is not applicable to machines:
    — with all saw blades spindles mounted below the workpiece support/level only;
    — intended for use in potentially explosive atmosphere;
    — manufactured prior to its publication.
