  content: "This document specifies minimum design and performance requirements for
    personal protective equipment (PPE) to be used by firefighters whilst engaged
    in fighting fires occurring in structures, primarily but not solely to protect
    against exposure to flame and high thermal loads.\nThe scope of this document
    does not include PPE for use in high risk fire exposures where, for example:\n—    
    protective clothing with reflective surface according to ISO 15538 might be more
    appropriate,\n—     where exposure to lower levels of heat or flame may be encountered
    by firefighters engaged in support activities where PPE according to ISO 11613
    might be more appropriate, \n—     or for use in firefighting operations in high
    ambient temperature (for example bush, wildland or forest firefighting) where
    PPE according to ISO 16073 series might be more appropriate.\nSimilarly, this
    document does not include PPE to protect against chemical and biological hazards,
    other than against short term and accidental exposure while engaged in firefighting
    and associated activities.\nThis document provides an approach of a single minimum
    design and performance requirements for PPE, including optional requirements where
    identified, and for product markings and manufacturer’s instructions.\nSelection
    of an appropriate system of protective equipment is dependent upon an effective
    risk assessment which identifies the hazards to be faced, evaluates the likelihood
    of those hazards, and provides the means to reduce or eliminate these hazards
    (see ISO/TR 21808)."
