    This document specifies a vocabulary for industrial data that defines generic terms for things that exist in more than one industrial domain.
    The following are within the scope of this document:
    —     definition of terms for generic types of industrial thing;
    EXAMPLE 1         Definitions of the terms “material object”, “artefact” and “product” are within the vocabulary.
    —     definition of terms relevant to assemblies, systems and their breakdown structures;
    —     definition of terms relevant to activities and participation in activities;
    —     definition of terms relevant to positions and roles in organizations;
    —     definition of terms relevant to behaviour, capability and function;
    —     definition of terms relevant to state and condition;
    —     definition of terms relevant to specifications, designs and plans;
    —     definition of terms relevant to versions, alternatives and configurations for specifications, designs and plans;
    —     definition of terms relevant to signals and other carriers of information and to devices that process signals and information;
    —     definition of terms relevant to physical quantities and properties.
    The following are outside the scope of this document:
    —     definition of terms that are relevant to data themselves, rather than the things that data are about;
    EXAMPLE 2         Definitions of the terms “data” and “information” are not within the vocabulary.
    —     definition of terms that are relevant to representations.
    EXAMPLE 3         Definitions of the terms “representation” and “model” are not within the vocabulary.
