abstract:
- content: "This proposal provides technical guidance for the treatment and reuse
    of fermentation-based pharmaceutical wastewater. It covers the general requirements
    for treatment and reuse of fermentation pharmaceutical wastewater, pollution load,
    process requirements for treatment and reuse of wastewater, recommendation of
    technology and process, etc. This proposal is applicable to:\na)\tProvide technical
    reference for project designers of fermentation-based pharmaceutical wastewater
    treatment;\nb)\tProvide standardized guidance for the operation and management
    of the wastewater treatment and reuse projects in fermentation-based pharmaceutical
    enterprises.\nc)\tProvide guidance for fermentation-based pharmaceutical enterprises
    to promote technological progress, realise product upgrading, energy conservation
    and the high-quality development of fermentation-based pharmaceutical wastewater
    treatment projects.\nThis proposed standard aims to provide guidance for the treatment
    and reuse technology and process selection of wastewater in fermentation pharmaceutical
    industry, to promote the development of \"zero discharge\" of industrial wastewater."
