abstract:
- content: "This document contains the basic control strategy, minimum functionality
    requirements, basic driver interface elements, minimum requirements for diagnostics
    and reaction to failure, and performance test procedures for road boundary departure
    prevention systems (RBDPS). RBDPS is a driving safety support system which acts
    on vehicles to prevent road departures. RBDPS is designed to reduce damage and
    accidents arising from road boundary departures. \nThis document is intended to
    be applied to systems that predict road boundary departures and maintain the vehicle
    within the road boundaries by both lateral acceleration control and longitudinal
    deceleration control. RBDPS is intended to operate on roads (well-developed and
    standardized freeways or highways) having solid lane markers. Roadwork zones or
    roads without visible road boundary markers are not within the scope of this document.
    RBDPS is intended for light duty passenger vehicles and heavy vehicles. RBDPS
    is not designed to operate continuously, but to operate automatically only when
    possible road boundary departures are detected or predicted. However, the driver's
    decision and operation takes priority at all times."
