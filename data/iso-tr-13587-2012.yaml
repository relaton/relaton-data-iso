  content: 'ISO/TR 13587:2012 is concerned with three basic statistical approaches
    for the evaluation and interpretation of measurement uncertainty: the frequentist
    approach including bootstrap uncertainty intervals, the Bayesian approach, and
    fiducial inference. The common feature of these approaches is a clearly delineated
    probabilistic interpretation or justification for the resulting uncertainty intervals.
    For each approach, the basic method is described and the fundamental underlying
    assumptions and the probabilistic interpretation of the resulting uncertainty
    are discussed. Each of the approaches is illustrated using two examples including
    an example from the ISO/IEC Guide 98-3 (Uncertainty of measurement ? Part 3: Guide
    to the expression of uncertainty in measurement (GUM:1995)). This document also
    includes a discussion of the relationship between the methods proposed in GUM
    Supplement 1 and these three statistical approaches.'
