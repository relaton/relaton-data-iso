    ISO 7314 gives specifications for medium pressure, high temperature, flexible metal hose assemblies suitable for continuous operation in liquid and pneumatic systems from - 55 °C to + 400 °C, with short duration excursions up to + 650 °C.
    The hose assemblies covered by this International Standard are intended for use in aerospace applications for conveying air and other gases in pneumatic systems, bleed air systems, heating and ventilating systems and instrument air systems. ISO 7314 does not cover flow velocity in such assemblies exceeding 54 m/s; higher velocities require special vibration-dampening devices.
    Hose assemblies supplied to the specifications laid down in this International Standard may be of two types:
     Type 1: Convoluted inner tube - welded, of moderate mass and moderate flexibility.
     Type 2: Convoluted inner tube - seamless or butt-welded and redrawn, of low mass and high flexibility.
