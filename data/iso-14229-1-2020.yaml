abstract:
- content: |-
    This document specifies data link independent requirements of diagnostic services, which allow a diagnostic tester (client) to control diagnostic functions in an on-vehicle electronic control unit (ECU, server) such as an electronic fuel injection, automatic gearbox, anti-lock braking system, etc. connected to a serial data link embedded in a road vehicle.
    It specifies generic services, which allow the diagnostic tester (client) to stop or to resume non-diagnostic message transmission on the data link.
    This document does not apply to non-diagnostic message transmission on the vehicle's communication data link between two electronic control units. However, this document does not restrict an in-vehicle on-board tester (client) implementation in an ECU in order to utilize the diagnostic services on the vehicle's communication data link to perform bidirectional diagnostic data exchange.
    This document does not specify any implementation requirements.
