  script: Latn
  content: ISO/IEC TR 16166:2010 discusses the security of session-based communications
    within Next Generation Corporate Networks. It uses terminology and concepts developed
    in ISO/IEC TR 12860. It identifies a number of requirements impacting Next Generation
    Network standardization and makes a number of recommendations concerning deployment
    of enterprise networks. In addition, a number of standardization gaps are identified.
    Both signalling security and media security are considered. The scope of ISO/IEC
    TR 16166:2010 is limited to communications with a real-time element, including
    but not limited to voice, video, real-time text, instant messaging and combinations
    of these (multi-media).
