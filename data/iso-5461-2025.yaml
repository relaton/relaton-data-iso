- content: |-
    This document provides criteria for planning or rating a failure reporting, analysis and corrective action (FRACA) process, with regard to its capability to collect, process, assess, and eliminate or control failures, in a cost-effective manner that is commensurate with the product safety or mission severity category and life cycle systems engineering product-critical characteristics data.
    This document is applicable for managing failures that occur to space, launch and ground control systems and equipment after qualification. The requirements in this document apply to all stakeholders that contribute to the design, analysis, test, production and operation of space systems, as required in ISO 14300-2.
