- content: |-
    ISO 2321:2017 specifies methods of test for determining general physical and mechanical properties of rubber threads, as well as specific mechanical properties of such threads in contact with fabrics. Owing to the comparatively small cross-section and the unusual conditions of service of this material, certain special methods have been developed.
    Some of the tests included in this document are not entirely suitable for threads made from certain synthetic rubbers (e.g. urethane rubber). These tests are intended for natural or synthetic polyisoprene rubbers.
    Comparisons can only be made on new rubber threads or on those with identical processing histories. In the interpretation of results from threads which have been subjected to spooling, fabrication or any other process, the previous history is important, and what is known of this and of any relaxation treatments used is intended to be reported.
