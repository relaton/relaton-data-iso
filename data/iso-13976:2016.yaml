    ISO 13976:2016 applies to hot-rolled carbon/manganese steel sheet in coils of structural quality without the use of microalloying elements. It is generally used in the delivered condition and is intended for bolted, riveted or welded structures. The product is produced on a wide sheet mill.
    The product is intended for structural purposes where particular mechanical properties are required.
    The steel sheet is produced in a number of grade designations designed to be compatible with differing application requirements.
    It does not cover steels intended for boilers or pressure vessels, or steels designated as commercial quality or drawing qualities, or steels rolled to cold-reduced products, or steels designated as weathering steels, having increased atmospheric corrosion resistance, or those products rolled on a plate mill.
