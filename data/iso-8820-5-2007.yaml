  content: "ISO 8820-5:2007 specifies fuse-links with axial terminals (Strip fuse-links)
    Type SF30 and SF51 and test fixtures for fuses in road vehicles. It establishes,
    for these fuse-link types, the rated current, test procedures, performance requirements
    and dimensions. \nISO 8820-5:2007 is applicable to fuse-links with a rated voltage
    of 32 V, a current rating of 30 A to 500 A and a breaking capacity of 2000 A intended
    for use in the electrical system of road vehicles with a nominal voltage of 12
    V and/or 24 V. \nISO 8820-5:2007 is intended to be used in conjunction with ISO
    8820-1 and with ISO 8820-2. The numbering of its clauses corresponds to that of
    ISO 8820-1, whose requirements are applicable, except where modified by requirements
    particular to ISO 8820-5:2007."
