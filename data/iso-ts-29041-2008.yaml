abstract:
- content: "In ISO/TS 29041:2008, the gravimetric mixture preparation as given in
    ISO 6142 is investigated for existing a priori influences, as well as correlations
    introduced by data processing. \nAll calculations refer to an example which consists
    in the preparation of a synthetic natural gas of a target composition as follows:
    1,4 mol % N2, 1,8 mol % CO2, 9,4 mol % ethane, 3,4 mol % propane, 1 mol % n-butane,
    and 83 mol % methane.\nAll considerations given for this example concerning mixture
    feasibility, choice of preparation procedure, and weighing steps and sequences
    are the same as given in ISO 6142. This also applies to all estimates for basic
    uncertainty sources and the purity tables of the gases used for preparation."
