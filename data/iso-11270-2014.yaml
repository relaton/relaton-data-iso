abstract:
- content: ISO 11270:2014 contains the basic control strategy, minimum functionality
    requirements, basic driver interface elements, minimum requirements for diagnostics
    and reaction to failure, and performance test procedures for Lane Keeping Assistance
    Systems (LKAS). LKAS provide support for safe lane keeping operations by drivers
    and do not perform automatic driving nor prevent possible lane departures. The
    responsibility for the safe operation of the vehicle always remains with the driver.
    LKAS is intended to operate on highways and equivalent roads. LKAS consist of
    means for recognizing the location of the vehicle inside its lane and means for
    influencing lateral vehicle movement. LKAS should react consistently with the
    driver expectations with respect to the visible lane markings. The support at
    roadway sections having temporary or irregular lane markings (such as roadwork
    zones) is not within the scope of ISO 11270:2014. ISO 11270:2014 is applicable
    to passenger cars, commercial vehicles, and buses.
