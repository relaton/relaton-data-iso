- content: |-
    This document establishes the general requirements for variable displacement uni-directional and bi-directional hydraulic motors, suitable for use in aircraft hydraulic systems at pressures up to 35 000 kPa (5 000 psi).
    These requirements include:
    —     design requirements;
    —     test requirements.
    Primary and secondary function motors (see Clause 4) are covered in this document; however, actuators with internal rotation angle limits and low-speed motors are not covered.
    This document is intended to be used in conjunction with the detail specification that is particular to each application.
