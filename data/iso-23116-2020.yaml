    This document specifies the types, nominal sizes, dimensions and materials, as well as construction, manufacturing and marking requirements, for the seats for Panama chocks installed to lead the mooring and towing rope of a ship. It is applicable to ships passing through the Panama Canal, which are normally assisted by locomotives using steel towing wires and/or by tug boats. These seats for chocks meet normal mooring requirements and Panama Canal requirements.
    NOTE    The seat for Panama chocks (SWL of 90 tons) for Panamax Plus and Neopanamax vessels can be replaced by seats for closed chocks (see ISO 23113).
