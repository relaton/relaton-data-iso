    ISO 37153:2017 provides the basis, requirements and guidance for a maturity model for the assessment of technical performance, process and interoperability of community infrastructure(s) as well as its contribution to the community, and guidance for future improvements.
    This document is applicable to
    a)    all types of community infrastructure, including, but not limited to, energy, water, transportation, waste and ICT,
    b)    single types of community infrastructure or multiple types of community infrastructure, and
    c)    all types of communities, regardless of geographical locations, size, economic structure, stage of economic development, and
    d)    all applicable stages of infrastructure life cycle (e.g. planning/design, construction, operation, decommission).
    NOTE       Utilization of natural systems, such as green infrastructure, is also considered as one type of infrastructure.
