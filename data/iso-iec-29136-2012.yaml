  content: ISO/IEC 29136:2012 provides requirements and recommendations for the accessibility
    of personal computer hardware, to be used when planning, developing, designing
    and distributing these computers. While it does not cover the behaviour of, or
    requirements for, assistive technologies, it does address connectivity of assistive
    technologies as an integrated component of interactive systems. Some requirements
    or recommendations in ISO/IEC 29136:2012 require software support; however, requirements
    and recommendations that solely focus on software are not included in ISO/IEC
    29136:2012.
