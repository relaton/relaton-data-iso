  content: "1.1 This International Standard specifies requirements, test methods and
    performance criteria for resettable oil mist detectors for use in fire hazard
    alarm systems installed on marine vessels. Oil mist detectors may be installed
    where an identified risk of fire caused by ignition of flammable liquids, such
    as hydraulic, fuel and lubricating oil systems, exists.\n1.2 This International
    Standard specifies requirements for the following detectors:\n— point type detectors
    employing a point aspirating sampling device or relying on dispersion of oil mist;\n—
    aspirating detectors, whereby the sampling point is separated from the sensing
    unit(s) and uses a pipe \nnetwork for carrying the sampling air to the sensing
    unit(s);\n— open path or beam type detectors, whereby the concept of the point
    detector is expanded to a sampling \npath which can be 20 m or more, as opposed
    to a few centimeters in the point type detector.\n1.3 For the testing of other
    types of detector working on different principles, this International Standard
    is only for guidance. Detectors with special characteristics and developed for
    specific risks, as well as those"
