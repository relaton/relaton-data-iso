  content: 'Investigates cross-channel mixing characteristics of solutes injected
    in streams. Specifically, it relates to the use of tracers for the measurement
    of discharge. The purpose of the report is as follows: to compare methods of defining
    the degree of mixing; to compare methods of estimating the mixing length and to
    recommend a particular method; to investigate the errors in dilution measurements
    associated with incomplete mixing; to discuss methods of reducing errors in dilution-discharge
    measurements when mixing is incomplete.'
