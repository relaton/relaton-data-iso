    ISO 16935:2006 sets forth test procedures to evaluate resistance of security glazing materials and products against ballistic impact with classification by weapon and ammunition.
    ISO 16935:2006 is applicable to attack by handguns, ammunition fired from machine pistols or submachine guns, rifles and shotguns, on products used for glazing in buildings, for both interior and exterior use.
    ISO 16935:2006 assumes the glazing is adequately fixed, but does not apply to the glazing system or the surrounding materials and structure.
