abstract:
- content: The determination is carried out by converting the carbonyl compounds to
    oximes by reaction with free hydroxylamine liberated in a mixture of hydroxylammoniumchloride
    and potassium hydroxide. The excess alkali is titrated with hydrochloric acid
    solution, either colorimetrically or potentiometrically. The method is applicable
    to essential oils which contain carbonyl compounds (especially ketones, excluding
    methylketones) which are difficult to convert to oximes by the method specified
    in ISO 1279. The method is not applicable to essential oils which contain substantial
    amounts of esters of other alkali-sensitive constituents.
