    ISO 16039:2004 establishes definitions, terminology and the content of commercial literature specifications for mobile, self-operating machines used for placing and finishing cement concrete, commonly called "slipform pavers", which mould concrete in a plastic condition. It specifies the general machine configuration and the special equipment depending on the types of work to be executed. This work can be concrete roadways, road safety structures (barriers, walls, etc.), road drainage structures (edgings, gulleys, gutters, etc.) and airport paving (runways, taxiways, aprons, etc.).
    ISO 16039:2004 does not apply to machines with non-travelling formwork fixed to the ground and to those construction works which require only a vertical progression.
