- content: |-
    This document specifies general requirements and definitions of Dimethyl Ether (DME) fuel system components, intended for use on the types of motor vehicles defined in ISO 3833. It also provides general design principles and specifies requirements for instructions and marking.
    This document is applicable to vehicles (mono-fuel, bi-fuel or dual-fuel applications) using Dimethyl Ether in accordance with ISO 16861 and ASTM D7901. It is not applicable to the following:
    a)    fuel containers;
    b)    stationary gas engines;
    c)    container mounting hardware;
    d)    electronic fuel management;
    e)    refuelling receptacles.
    NOTE 1    It is recognized that miscellaneous components not specifically covered herein can be examined to meet the criteria of this document and tested according to the appropriate functional tests.
    NOTE 2    All references to pressure in this document are considered gauge pressures unless otherwise specified.
