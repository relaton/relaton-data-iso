abstract:
- content: |-
    ISO 15031-6:2010 provides uniformity for standardized Diagnostic Trouble Codes (DTC) that electrical/electronic On-Board Diagnostic (OBD) systems of motor vehicles are required to report when malfunctions are detected. It also provides guidance for uniform messages (text descriptor) associated with these codes.
    ISO 15031-6 specifies the rules and guidelines for the definition of the DTC format, which consists of an addressing format, structure, and messages; a standardized set of DTCs and descriptions; and a standardized set of DTC subtypes known as Failure Types.
    ISO 15031-6:2010 specifies all general rules and guidelines to define new DTCs. It references the SAE J2012-DA (Digital Annex), which includes all standardized DTCs (number and text descriptor) as well as all DTC subtypes known as failure types.
