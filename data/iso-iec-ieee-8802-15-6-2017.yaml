abstract:
- content: 'This is a standard for short-range, wireless communication in the vicinity
    of, or inside, a human body (but not limited to humans). It uses existing industrial
    scientific medical (ISM) bands as well as frequency bands approved by national
    medical and/or regulatory authorities. Support for quality of service (QoS), extremely
    low power, and data rates up to 10 Mbps is required while simultaneously complying
    with strict non-interference guidelines where needed. This standard considers
    effects on portable antennas due to the presence of a person (varying with male,
    female, skinny, heavy, etc.), radiation pattern shaping to minimize specific absorption
    rate (SAR) into the body, and changes in characteristics as a result of the user
    motions.  '
