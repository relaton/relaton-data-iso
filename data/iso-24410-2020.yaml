    This document provides for the interchangeability of attachments on skid steer loaders by establishing requirements for the quick coupler system including dimensional limits for the attachment mounting frame. These quick couplers are typically used on skid steer loaders as defined in ISO 6165.
    NOTE 1  Skid steer loaders can use other styles of quick couplers but the coupler would not be interchangeable with attachments designed to comply with this document.
    NOTE 2  The requirements of this document can be applied to quick couplers used on other compact machines.
    NOTE 3  Quick couplers used on small skid steer loaders and some compact tool carriers can have a different width requirement than provided in this document. See Annex B.
