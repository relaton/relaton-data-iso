    ISO/TS 18409:2018 specifies two methods for collecting a fluid sample to be used to analyse the cleanliness of hydraulic fluid power hoses or hose assemblies within a certain inside diameter and length range (this range includes the majority of hose assemblies of real fluid power applications).
    The two methods described in this document are intended for collecting only solid particulate contamination; they may not be appropriate for collecting contamination in liquid or grease form.
    ISO/TS 18409:2018 is a specific application of ISO 18413:2015, specifically Annexes A and B.
    The scope of ISO/TS 18409:2018 does not include providing efficient and effective cleaning methods for hose assemblies. These methods are recommended for statistical validation of other hose cleaning methods, which are more suitable for systematic processing of large production batches.
    Contamination analysis is excluded from the scope of this document.
