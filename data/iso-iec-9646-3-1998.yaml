  content: "1.1  This part of l[SO/lEC 9646 defines an informal test notation, called
    the Tree and Tabular Combined Notation (TTCN), for OS1 conformance test suites,
    which is independent of test methods, layers and protocols, and which reflects
    the abstract testing methodology defined in ISO/IEC 9646-l and ISWIEC 9646-2.\n1.2
    \ It also specifies requirements and provides guidance for using TTCN in the specification
    of system-independent conformance test suites for one or more OS1 standards. It
    specifies two forms of the notation: one, a human-readable form, applicable to
    the production of conformance test suite standards for OS1 protocols; and the
    other, a machine-processable form, applicable to processing within and between
    computer systems.\n1.3  This part of ISO/IEC 9646 applies to the specification
    of conformance test cases which can be expressed abstractly in terms of control
    and observation of protocol data units and abstract service primitives. Nevertheless,
    for some protocols, test cases may be needed which cannot be expressed in these
    terms. The specification of such test cases is outside the scope of this part
    of ISO/IEC 9646, although those test cases may need to be included in a conformance
    test suite standard.\nFor example. some static conformance requirements related
    to an application service may require testing techniques which are specific to
    that particular application.\nThe specification of test cases in which more than
    one behavior description is to be run in parallel is dealt with by the concurrency
    features (particularly involving the definition of Test Components and Test Component
    Configurations).\n1.4  This part of ISO/IEC 9646 specifies requirements on what
    a test suite standard may specify about a conforming realization of the test suite,
    including the operational semantics of TTCN test suites.\n1.5  This part of ISO/IEC
    9646 applies to the specification of conformance test suites for OS1 protocols
    in OS1 layers 2 to 7, specifically including Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.
    1) based protocols. The following are outside the scope of this part of ISOIIEC
    9646:\na) the specification of conformance test suites for Physical layer protocols;
    \nb) the relationship between TTCN and formal description techniques;\nc) the
    means of realization of executable test suites (ETS) from abstract test suites.\n1.6
    \ This part of ISO/IEC 9646 defines mechanisms for using concurrency in the specification
    of abstract test cases. Concurrency in TTCN is applicable to the specification
    of test cases:\na) in a multi-party testing context; \nb) which handle multiplexing
    and demultiplexing in either a single-party or multi-party testing context;\nc)
    which handle splitting and recombining in either a single-party or multi-party
    testing context;\nd) in a single-party testing context when the complexity of
    the protocol or set of protocols handled by the IUT is such that concurrency can
    simplify the specification of the test case\n1.7 TTCN modules are defined to allow
    sharing of common TTCN specifications between test suites."
