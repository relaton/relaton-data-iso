    ISO/TR 18159:2015 provides information about environmental laws and regulations that can affect microfilm processing laboratories. These laws and regulations control the following microfilm processing activities:
    -      storage and disposal of effluents;
    -      storage and disposal of hazardous waste, employee safety training;
    -      notification of the public regarding hazardous waste incidents.
    NOTE          This Technical Report includes in an Annex, for information purposes, a discussion of The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Guidance Manual on the Development and Implementation of Local Discharge Limitations Under Pretreatment Programme and that guidance manual's relationship with state and local requirements in the United States. Also included in this Technical Report are examples of typical discharge limitations.
