  content: ISO 24409-2:­2014 prescribes standardized signs and safety notices specifically
    for use on board ships. Each sign is categorized and indexed according to the
    safety message that is to be conveyed. Each sign is provided with relevant information
    on the preferred format of use, the context in which it is used and displayed
    as well as a description of the intended audience. The shape and colour required
    to be used for each sign, as prescribed by ISO 3864-4, are given together with
    the graphical symbols contained within each sign. ISO 24409-2:2014 specifies the
    sign originals that may be scaled for reproduction and application purposes. It
    includes signs which require supplementary text signs to be used in conjunction
    with them to improve comprehension. This catalogue is intended to be under continual
    revision as new shipboard signs and notices are added and as new requirements
    are identified and corresponding safety signs and notices are developed and standardised.
    Where an ISO 7010 reference number is given in ISO 24409-2:2014 it means that
    the sign is identical to the one in ISO 7010.
