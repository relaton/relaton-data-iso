    To investigate the following:
    Multi-cloud API Managementa) Existing projects related to• API management enabling cloud interoperability and portabilityb) Justification for• a common framework for API management across various providersc) Mechanisms regarding:• Challenges in API management and usage in developing and maintaining applicationsacross cloud providers, including but not limited to changing API versions.• reducing complexity and enable rapid development of services by stitching togethermultiple, heterogeneous APIs provided by various vendors.
    Multi-cloud service metering and billinga) Existing projects related to• Cloud service metering and billingb) Justification for• Requirements and a common vocabulary and terms for cloud service metering and billingc) Mechanisms regarding:• To provide a single pane of glass or otherwise a standardized central cost metering view in amulti-cloud environment.• budget forecasting in a multi-cloud environment (while minimising human intervention andincreasing accuracy)• To perform uniform and consistent metering and billing of cloud services
    Multi-cloud environmenta) Existing projects related to• Policy management framework in cloud, especially multi-cloud environmentsb) Justification for• compatibility between various formats, policy code/languages and integration mechanisms• Common understanding regarding location, adoption method for various policies in multicloud
    • Deployment and usage guidelines for a policy enforcement framework in multi-cloudenvironment.c) Mechanisms regarding:• To policy management and enforcement in a uniform and consistent manner across clouds
