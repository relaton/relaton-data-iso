  content: "This document will provide guidance for use for establishing, developing,
    implementing, evaluating, maintaining and improving an effective anti-fraud management
    system.   The guidance will be generic and applicable to all organizations, regardless

    sectors.\nThe guidance will include:\n• creation and maintenance of a fraud risk
    recognition, tracking and monitoring environment within an organisation including
    proactive control systems, protocols and procedures;\n• mitigation of internal
    and external fraud against, and by, the organization;\n• detection of fraud in
    the event that pre-emptive counter-fraud strategies, protocols and procedures
    fail to identify and trace incidents;\n• effective response to fraud events so
    that \n- lessons are learned that can be applied to the mitigation framework,
    \n- reputational harm to the organisation can be minimised and restored,\n- funds
    lost to fraud can be recovered.\n\nThis is a Type B management system standard."
