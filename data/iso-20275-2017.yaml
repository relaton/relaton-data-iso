    ISO 20275:2017 specifies the elements of an unambiguous scheme to identify the distinct entity legal forms in a jurisdiction. Its aim is to enable legal forms within jurisdictions to be codified and thus facilitate the classification of legal entities according to their legal form.
    It is not the purpose of the document to give the comparison or alignment of entity legal forms across different jurisdictions, so as not to limit its usage and relevance.
