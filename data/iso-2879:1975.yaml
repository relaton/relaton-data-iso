  content: Applicable to the analysis of glycerines free from organic compounds other
    than glycerol having more than two hydroxyl goups on adjacent carbon atoms, such
    as sugars which can also give rise to formic acid and, for this reason, will interfere
    in the determination. The procedure begins with a cold oxidation of the glycerol
    by sodium periodate in a strongly acid medium, followed by titration of the formic
    acid produced by the reaction with standard volumetric sodium hydroxide solution,
    using a pH meter.
