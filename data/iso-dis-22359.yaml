abstract:
- content: "The proposed standard provides guidelines for hardened protective shelters
    in terms of their planning, construction, operation and maintenance. It acts as
    guidance to any activity or operation related to hardened protective shelters
    and offers help to all relevant stakeholders in their endeavours to protect citizens,
    assets and important societal functions against harmful effects of hazards, which
    can be intentionally caused by humans, initiated accidentally or caused through
    natural conditions.\n\nThe proposed standard is intended for use by organizations
    or individuals being responsible for or involved in decision-making, planning,
    implementation, administration, use or upkeep of hardened protective shelters,
    such as local, regional and national governments; civil protection agencies; first
    responders; and businesses such as designers, constructers and equipment suppliers.\n\nThe
    proposed standard covers design, construction, exploitation and maintenance of
    hardened protective shelters. It defines the terms referenced in this document
    and specifies the parts, features, equipment, actions and responsibilities related
    to each phase of the life cycle of a shelter.\n\nThe proposed standard does not
    cover the minimum requirements or exact specifications for any property of or
    action related to a shelter, as these normally are detailed in national legislation
    and regulations of each country. \n\nThe proposed standard is not a management
    system standard, but rather a guideline standard that complements existing management
    system standards and provides guidance to those implementing such standards in
    the area of civil protection by means of hardened protective shelters. \n\nBeing
    a guideline standard, this International Standard is not intended to be used for
    certification purposes."
