    ISO 16301 specifies the requirements for three classes of wire- or textile-reinforced hydraulic hoses and hose assemblies of nominal sizes ranging from 5 to 25. The hoses and hose assemblies are used in hydraulic jack applications with manually operated hand pumps. They are suitable for use with hydraulic fluids HH, HL, HM, HR and HV at temperature ranging from −40 °C to +55 °C. For tools that require heavy duty services such as a rescue tool, ISO 19718[3] applies.
    ISO 16301 does not include requirements for the connection ends. It is limited to the performance of hoses and hose assemblies. The maximum working pressure of hose assemblies is regulated by the lowest maximum working pressure of the components.
    NOTE 1    It is the responsibility of the user, in consultation with the hose manufacturer, to establish the compatibility of the hose with the fluid to be used.
    NOTE 2    There are two International Standards for hoses for hydraulic jacks and tool applications, i.e. ISO 16301 and ISO 19718. The comparison table is given in Annex A.
    NOTE 3    The classification of HH, HL, HM, HR and HV is found in ISO 6743-4[2].
