  content: "ISO 22853:2005 specifies the XML application MSML (Maritime Safety Markup
    Language). MSML is a language for structuring information and the goal is to create
    an open standard that can be used generally in the maritime sector. MSML is implemented
    using XML Schema, which is contained in a separate document that could be used
    at validation. The first purpose of MSML is to make it possible to record safety
    related information in relation to repair and maintenance. The second purpose
    is to define an extensible structure that could be developed in future versions
    of MSML. Note that MSML should not primarily be seen as a support for normal work
    onboard. Instead, it is an add-on support for transfers of safety related information
    to/from the vessel.\nMSML enables security handling and since MSML concerns safety
    aspects there is information support for\n- preventing accidents;\n- minimizing
    extent of damage; \n- minimizing criticality of consequences. \nThese aspects
    concern both vessel and bases ashore (denoted shore bases in this Publicly Available
    Specification).\nMSML consists of the following constituents:\n- data model that
    defines the data of interest. The basic parts of the data model are vessel static
    and dynamic areas, shore base static and dynamic areas and vessel shore base relation.
    Each of these can be created successively and thus validation can be made even
    if information is not complete;\n- administrative support that defines the handling
    of the XML application instance as a file;\n- security support that defines the
    handling of data security. MSML enables digital signatures and encryption via
    the W3C recommendations 'XML Encryption Syntax and Processing' and 'XML-Signature
    Syntax and Processing'."
