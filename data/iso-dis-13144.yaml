abstract:
- content: "This document specifies a method for the qualification and quantification
    of certain quinoline derivatives in textile products by means of extraction with
    methanol and gas chromatography with mass selective detector or liquid chromatography
    with mass selective detector. The method is applicable to all kinds of textile
    products consisting of natural or artificially dyed textile fibres and fabrics.
    \nIt is further applicable to dyestuff powder used as textile auxiliary for dyeing
    and printing."
