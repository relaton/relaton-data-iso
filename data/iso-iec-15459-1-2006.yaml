abstract:
- content: "Unique identification can occur at many different levels in the supply
    chain, at the transport unit, at the item level, and elsewhere. Such distinct
    entities are often handled by several parties: the sender, the receiver, one or
    more carriers, customs authorities, etc. Each of these parties must be able to
    identify and trace the item so that reference can be made to associated information
    such as address, order number, contents of the item, weight, sender, batch or
    lot number, etc. \nThe information is often held on computer systems, and may
    be exchanged between parties involved via EDI (Electronic Data Interchange) and
    XML (eXtensible Markup Language) messages.\nThere are considerable benefits if
    the identity of the item is represented in bar code format, or other AIDC (Automatic
    Identification and Data Capture) media and attached to or made a constituent part
    of that which is being uniquely identified so that\n- it can be read electronically,
    thus minimising errors;\n- one identifier can be used by all parties;\n- each
    party can use the identifier to look up its computer files to find the data associated
    with the item;\n- the identifier is unique within the class and cannot appear
    on any other item of the class during the lifetime of the item.\nThe unique identifier
    for transport units defined in ISO/IEC 15459-1:2006 and represented in a bar code
    label, two-dimensional symbol, radio-frequency identification tag, or other AIDC
    media attached to the item meets these needs. \nAll AIDC technologies have the
    potential to encode a unique identifier. It is expected that application standards
    for items, using various automatic identification technologies, will be developed
    based upon the unique identifier as a prime key. These application standards may
    be made available from the Issuing Agency.\nISO/IEC 15459-1:2006 specifies a unique,
    non-significant, string of characters for the identification of transport units.
    The character string is intended to be represented in a bar code label or other
    AIDC media attached to the item to meet item management needs. To address management
    needs different classes of items are recognized in the various parts of ISO/IEC
    15459, which allows different requirements to be met by the unique identifiers
    associated with each class. The rules for the unique identifier for transport
    units, to identify physical logistical transfers, with the identity relevant for
    the duration of one or more items in the load being held or transported as part
    of that load, are defined and supported by an example."
