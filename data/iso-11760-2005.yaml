abstract:
- content: ISO 11760:2005 describes a simple classification system for coals providing
    guidance on the selection of the appropriate ISO standard procedures for the analyses
    and testing, international comparison in terms of some key characteristics and
    descriptive categorization of coals. The system is applicable to coals of all
    ranks, but care is required in relation to the classification of some types of
    coal. It is also applicable to a wide range of representative coal samples, provided
    their exact nature is stated. Such samples include bore-core seam sections and
    composite samples, raw (as-mined) coal, washed coal, blends of coals of similar
    rank and selected, specified size fractions.
