abstract:
- content: |-
    This document specifies the requirements for solid-wall styrene copolymer blend (SAN + PVC) pipes and fittings for soil and waste discharge (low and high temperature) above ground inside buildings, and for the system itself. It does not include buried pipework.
    It also specifies the test parameters for the test methods referred to within this document.
    This document is applicable to SAN + PVC pipes and fittings, as well as assemblies of such pipes and fittings, intended to be used for the following purposes:
    a) soil and waste discharge pipework for the conveyance of domestic waste waters (low and high temperature);
    b) ventilation pipework associated with a);
    c) rainwater pipework inside the building.
    This document is applicable to pipes and fittings designed for jointing by means of elastomeric sealing rings, solvent cementing or integral dual-purpose sockets, i.e. for elastomeric ring seal joints and/or for solvent cement joints.
