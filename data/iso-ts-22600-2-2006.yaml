    ISO/TS 22600-2:2006 is intended to support the needs of healthcare information sharing across unaffiliated providers of healthcare, healthcare organizations, health insurance companies, their patients, staff members and trading partners. It is also intended to support inquiries from both individuals and application systems.
    ISO/TS 22600-2:2006 supports collaboration between several authorization managers that may operate over organizational and policy borders.
    ISO/TS 22600-2:2006 introduces the underlying paradigm of formal high level models for architectural components based on ISO/IEC 10746. In that context, the Domain Model, the Document Model, the Policy Model, the Role Model, the Authorization Model, the Delegation Model, the Control Model and the Access Control Model are introduced.
