abstract:
- content: "This International Standard specifies the characteristics and requirements
    for components such as pipes, fittings, and valves made from one of the following
    materials intended to be used for thermoplastics piping systems in the field of
    industrial applications above and below ground:\n—    unplasticized polyamide
    (PA-U)\nNOTE 1     Requirements for industrial valves are given in this International
    Standard and/or in other standards. Valves are to be used with components conforming
    to this International Standard provided that they conform additionally to the
    relevant requirements of this International Standard.\nThis International Standard
    is applicable to either PA-U pipes, fittings, valves, and their joints and to
    joints with components of other plastics and non-plastic materials, depending
    on their suitability, intended to be used for the conveyance of liquid and gaseous
    fluids as well as solid matter in fluids for industrial applications such as the
    following:\n—    transport of oil, gaseous fuels and multiphase mixtures (exploration
    and production; general purpose hydrocarbon-based fluids);\n—    transport of
    renewable gases (hydrogen, biomethane); \n—    transport of contaminated sewer
    (e.g. contaminated with hydrocarbons);\n—    transport of CO2 (carbon capture
    and utilisation or storage (CCUS))\nNOTE 2     Where relevant, national regulations
    are applicable.\nOther application areas are permitted if the requirements of
    this International Standard and/or applicable national requirements are fulfilled.\nNational
    regulations in respect of fire behaviour and explosion risk are applicable.\nThe
    components have to withstand the mechanical, thermal, and chemical demands to
    be expected and have to be resistant to the fluids to be conveyed.\nCharacteristics
    and requirements which are applicable for PA-U are covered by the relevant clauses
    of this International Standard. Those characteristics and requirements which are
    dependent on the material are given in the relevant normative annex A.\nComponents
    conforming to any of the product standards listed in the bibliography or with
    national standards, as applicable, may be used with components conforming to this
    International Standard, provided that they conform to the requirements for joint
    dimensions and to the relevant requirements of this International Standard.\n "
