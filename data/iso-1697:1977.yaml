  content: Specifies the sampling, the determination of ditillation characteristics,
    the determination of density at 20 °C, the determination of residue on evaporation,
    the determination of water and the determination of acidity. The determination
    of distillation characteristics indicates the difference between the temperatures
    corresponding to the collection of two volumes of distillate, V0 and V1. These
    two volumes will be indicated in the specification pf product agreed between th
    intersted parties. Replaces ISO Recommendation R 1697-1970.
