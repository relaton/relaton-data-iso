abstract:
- content: "This standard is developed to link product engineering and the successful
    performance of an autonomous underwater vehicle, especially for “extreme missions”.
    An extreme mission being a relative term can be seen as any underwater expedition
    that is increasing in difficulty level. While these vehicles have been and are
    being manufactured by many companies all around the globe for several decades,
    their risk of failure, safety, and reliability in the sea is not commonly discussed
    as a standard summary of information. The scope of this standard is to define
    the known limitations of AUVs for successfully performing extreme missions. Excluded
    from this standard are any subjects related to the manufacturing and/ or operation
    of the following items:\n•\tAutonomous underwater gliders (AUGs) as they use a
    narrowly modifiable set of operational commands.\n•\tBatteries for the use of
    AUVs.\n•\tElectrical motors for the use of AUVs.\n\nNOTE\tsensors, communication
    devices, and any other pieces and parts directly influencing the “digital mission”
    of the vehicle must be held responsible for its risk of failure and are not excluded
    from the scope of this standard. The success of a digital mission means that a
    successful algorithm conducts the vehicle to achieve its sequential and final
    goal."
