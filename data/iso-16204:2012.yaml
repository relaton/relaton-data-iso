    This International Standard specifies principles and recommends procedures for the verification of the durability
    of concrete structures subject to:
    — known or foreseeable environmental actions causing material deterioration ultimately leading to failure
    of performance;
    — material deterioration without aggressiveness from the external environment of the structure, termed selfageing.
    NOTE The inclusion of, for example, chlorides in the concrete mix might cause deterioration over time without the
    ingress of additional chlorides from the environment.
    This International Standard is intended for use by national standardization bodies when establishing or
    validating their requirements for durability of concrete structures. It may also be applied:
    — for the assessment of remaining service life of existing structures; and
    — for the design of service life of new structures provided quantified parameters on levels of reliability and
    design parameters are given in a national annex to this International Standard.
    Fatigue failure due to cyclic stress is not within the scope of this International Standard.
