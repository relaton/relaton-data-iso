    This document provides a taxonomy to classify the type of adaptivity within vehicle systems. The taxonomy includes five types ranging from no adaptation (type 0) to adaptations based on interpreted user characteristics and context data (type 4). This document provides definitions of the five types of adaptation and explains adaptation in a consistent and coherent manner. By offering definitions and descriptions of the five types, this document can be used to classify the adaptivity within vehicle systems according to the types.
    This document is intended to be applied to all components of vehicle systems that the driver and/or other occupants interact with either while driving or while parked. This includes vehicle information systems, communication systems, for example, navigation systems or mobile devices connected to the vehicle infrastructure, traffic and travel information (TTI) systems, as well as vehicle comfort systems, for example, climate control, massage, or ambient lighting. The taxonomy is also applicable to third-party software provided by third-party suppliers that is displayed and/or operated in the vehicle.
    The taxonomy can also be applied to interactive exterior elements, like windscreen wipers or pedestrian communication devices and non-driving-related functions that are novel to future vehicles in the context of automated driving, such as playing a video.
    The information and communication vehicle systems described in this document exclude driving-operation or driving-assistance systems. Consequently, safety-related functions governed by Automotive Safety Integrity Level (ASIL) specifications (ISO 26262) are not addressed. Implementation and validation of data collection/detection are also beyond the scope. Additionally, priority handling, as well as varying legal regulations across countries, are not covered in the taxonomy.
