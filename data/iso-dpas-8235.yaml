abstract:
- content: "The document provides a taxonomy for adaptive in-vehicle information systems
    that interpret and adapt to defined context parameters. Adaptive systems compared
    to non-adaptive systems allow that functions in systems change according to learned
    parameters. The taxonomy includes five levels ranging from no adaptation of a
    system (Level 0) to adaptation to interpreted user and context factors (Level
    4). Adaptive systems can be classified according to the levels and more than one
    level can be applied to one system. The document provides definitions of the five
    levels of adaptation for in-vehicle information systems. The taxonomy explains
    system adaptation in a consistent and coherent manner. \nIn-vehicle information
    systems refer to all systems in road vehicles that are not related to the primary
    driving task. I.e. the levels of adaptation relate neither to ADAS, nor to automated
    driving functions. The document provides examples for systems in order to illustrate
    the application of the taxonomy, while the concrete technical realization of the
    systems themselves is out of scope. \nAdditionally, even though the levels of
    adaptation do consider driver monitoring and driver state detection as necessary
    input parameter at a certain level, considerations on the technical implementation
    or validation of such systems are out of scope."
