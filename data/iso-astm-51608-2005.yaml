abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: ISO/ASTM 51608:2005 outlines the installation qualification program for
    an X-ray (bremsstrahlung) irradiator and the dosimetric procedures to be followed
    during operational qualification, performance qualification and routine processing
    to ensure that the entire product has been treated within a predetermined range
    of absorbed dose. Other procedures related to operational qualification, performance
    qualification and routine processing that may influence absorbed dose in the product
    are also discussed. Information about effective or regulatory dose limits and
    energy limits for X-radiation is not within the scope of ISO/ASTM 51608:2005.
