- content: |-
    This document is applicable to dry gas sealing systems for axial, centrifugal, and rotary screw compressors and expanders as described in ISO 10439 (all parts), ISO 10440-1 and ISO 10440-2. Although intended for use primarily in oil refineries, it is also applicable to petrochemical facilities, gas plants, liquefied natural gas (LNG) facilities and oil and gas production facilities. The information provided is designed to aid in the selection of the system that is most appropriate for the risks and circumstances involved in various installations.
    This document does not apply to other types of shaft seals such as clearance seals, restrictive ring seals or oil seals.
    This document is a supplement to API Std 692, 1st edition (2018), the requirements of which are applicable with the exceptions specified in this document.
