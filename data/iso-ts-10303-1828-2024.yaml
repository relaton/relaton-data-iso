    ISO/TS 10303-1828 specifies the application module for Wiring harness assembly design.
    The following are within the scope of ISO/TS 10303-1828:
    - electrical definition of a wiring harness;
    - wire-list for an wiring harness assembly, consisting of:

    wires and cables;
    terminal lug;
    terminal block;
    electrically non conductive through termination;
    wire cap;
    single and multi pin connector contact;
    splice definitions within the harness assembly;
    electrical shielding definition in the assembly.


    - component-list for an wiring harness assembly, consisting of:

    connector and associated material;
    terminal lug;
    terminal block;
    electrically non conductive through termination;
    wire cap;
    single and multi pin connector contact;
    splice definitions within the harness assembly;
    electrical shielding definition in the assembly;
    tape marking.


    - modifications made to the cables and wires to be used in the harness;
    - assembly joints, each of which specify the mechanical connection between two terminals;
    - requirement allocation from the physical connectivity definition to the implementing item in the wire list;
    - assembly_joint that reference an external item;
    - segment topology of an electrical harness;
    - cross section structure of harness segments;
    - marking of harness components and topology segments;
    - protection of harness segments including:

    grommet;
    retention clamps;
    sleeving;
    overall shielding for one or more harness segments.


    - items within the scope of application module Wire and cable design connectivity, ISO/TS 10303-1845;
    - items within the scope of application module Extruded structure cross section, ISO/TS 10303-1827;
    - items within the scope of application module Edge based topological representation with length, ISO/TS 10303-1830.
