    ISO TR 14799-1:2005 consists of a comparison of the requirements of selected topics as covered by the following world-wide safety standards (excluding local deviations):
    a) Europe (CEN) -- EN 115; Safety rules for the construction and installation of escalators and passenger conveyors (Edition January 1995 and Amendment A1: 1998);
    b) USA -- ASME A 17.1-1996; Safety Code for Elevators and Escalators (The requirements for Canada (B 44) are generally the same as for the USA. Any differences are stated in the text.)
    c) Australia -- AS 1735 parts 5 and 6 for escalators and moving walks (Edition 1996);
    d) Japan -- Safety requirements mainly comprised of Building Standard Law Enforcement Order (BSLJ-EO), Notifications of Ministry of Construction (MOC-N, No. 1110-1981) and draft of Japan Elevator Association Standard (JEAS);
    e) Russia -- PUBEE 10-77-94, Regulations for the installation and safe use of escalators (Edition 1995);
    f) Korea -- The Elevator Inspection Standards, KATS 2001-414 Edition according to the Korea Elevator Law 4482, both cover the safety requirements on the escalator and moving walk.
    In addition to the above listed standards and other regulations, escalators and moving walks may be required to conform to the requirements of other standards as appropriate. Where ISO/TC 178/WG 5 was aware of these standards they are mentioned in the Bibliography.
