  content: "This document specifies a test method for determining the interfacial
    shear strength between a single fibre and a matrix by means of a pull-out test.
    The method can be used to measure the critical energy release rate.\nThe method
    is applicable to reinforcement fibres such as carbon fibres, glass fibres, basalt
    fibres and similar stiff reinforcement fibres and to thermoset, thermoplastic
    and fine-grained concrete matrices. It can be used for polymeric reinforcement
    fibres and for other inorganic matrices.\nIt is not applicable to:\n1)\telastomeric
    fibres and elastomeric matrices such as rubber;\n2)\tmatrices which cure or melt
    at temperatures above 400 °C;\n3)\tmatrices that show a strong tendency to bubble
    formation or expansion during the sample-preparation process;\n4)\tfoams."
