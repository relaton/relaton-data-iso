    This document specifies a generic tyre model and model parameters for calculating lateral tyre forces, for use in lateral stability simulations of heavy commercial vehicle combinations with test cases according to ISO 14791. This tyre model is parameterized by easily understandable characteristics which can be estimated from tyre measurement data. If tyre data is not available, the parameters proposed in this document can be used.
    One typical application area of this document is the comparing and ranking of various vehicle combination configurations with respect to on-road lateral and roll stability. Such an assessment is usually performed at close to constant speed levels typical for public roads, usually higher than 40 km/h. The tyre model, however, can be useful for both high- and low-speed manoeuvring.
    This tyre model is relevant for representing the lateral performance of tyres on a vehicle combination when the longitudinal forces are insignificant, typically less than 10 % of the peak longitudinal friction utilization. The tyre model can be used for normal forces ranging from zero to twice the nominal normal force of the tyre. This tyre model has been developed for moderate lateral slip conditions; it is important that the model is used with care for scenarios where tyre slip angle exceeds 15°.
    This tyre model is suitable for vehicle models operating in the yaw and roll plane which naturally include vertical load transfer between the wheels during manoeuvring. The tyre model can also be used in models with less complexity such as pure yaw plane models.
    This document applies to heavy vehicles, including commercial vehicles, commercial vehicle combinations, buses and articulated buses as defined in ISO 3833 (trucks and trailers with a maximum weight above 3,5 tonnes and buses and articulated buses with a maximum weight above 5 tonnes, according to ECE and EC vehicle classification, categories M3, N2, N3, O3 and O4).
