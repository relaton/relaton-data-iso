    ISO/IEC 14543-5-102:2020(E) specifies the system architecture and communication protocols of remote universal management profile to achieve intelligent grouping, resource sharing and service collaboration among different devices and controllers. The protocol features are:
    a) remote universal device discovery and management framework that includes connection methods and network architecture, device configuration interfaces, management message formats and message exchange flows;
    b) request/response message formats for four remote universal management profile device types: water heater, refrigerator, air conditioner, microwave.
    This document is applicable to remote access of water heaters, refrigerators, air conditioners, microwave ovens at home, office or other remote environments, to achieve universal management and interactions among these controllers and devices
