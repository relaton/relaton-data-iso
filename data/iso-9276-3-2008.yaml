    ISO 9276-3:2008 specifies methods for the adjustment of an experimental curve to a reference model with respect to a statistical background. Furthermore, the evaluation of the residual deviations, after the adjustment, is also specified. The reference model can also serve as a target size distribution for maintaining product quality.
    ISO 9276-3:2008 specifies procedures that are applicable to the following reference models: a) normal distribution (Laplace-Gauss): powders obtained by precipitation, condensation or natural products (pollens); b) log-normal distribution (Galton MacAlister): powders obtained by grinding or crushing; c) Gates-Gaudin-Schuhmann distribution (bilogarithmic): analysis of the extreme values of the fine particle distributions; d) Rosin-Rammler distribution: analysis of the extreme values of the coarse particle distributions; e) any other model or combination of models, if a non-linear fit method is used.
    ISO 9276-3:2008 can substantially support product quality assurance or process optimization related to particle size distribution analysis.
