abstract:
- content: |-
    The procedures in ISO 15484:2008 apply to disc brake pads and drum brake linings for motor vehicles and describe systematic processes for the quality assurance of such brake linings.
    In conjunction with tolerance ranges, the test methods and results described in ISO 15484:2008 permit a rapid assessment of disc brake pads.
    Uniform handling of the procedures through various phases ensures that the quality assurance requirements are clearly understood and that a global implementation is possible in the relationship between customers and suppliers.
    ISO 15484:2008 relates to the completed friction material and is applicable during product development to the quality assurance of ongoing series production, focussing on the “component” friction material. It is advisable that tests with apparent “system” character be avoided.
    Raw material checks and processing control are outside the scope of ISO 15484:2008.
