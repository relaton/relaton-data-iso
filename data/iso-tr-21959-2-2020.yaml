abstract:
- content: This document focuses on system-initiated and human-initiated transitions
    (Clause 6) from a higher level to a lower level of automated driving. Human factors
    and system factors that can influence takeover performance are included (Clauses
    7 and 8). Although some are still under investigation, there is a need to appropriately
    set these factors as variables to better understand their effects or to better
    control/eliminate their influence. This approach will aid research design by ensuring
    that important factors are considered and support consistency across studies enabling
    meaningful comparisons of findings. This document also includes information on
    considerations in test scenario design (Clause 9), common measures for human takeover
    performance (Clause 10) and considerations in choosing a testing environment (Clause
    11) to help readers design experiments comparable to other studies.
