abstract:
- content: "This International Standard is applicable to radiation shielding design
    and evaluation work for medical proton accelerators with nominal energies of the
    beam ranging from 70 MeV to 250 MeV, with subsystem such as beamlines, energy
    selection system (for cyclotron) and nozzle components. \nThe radiation protection
    requirements and recommendations given in this international standard cover the
    aspects relating to regulations, shielding design goals and other design criteria,
    role of the manufacturers, of the radiation protection officer or qualified expert
    and interactions between stakeholders, source terms and radiations around a proton
    accelerator, shielding for accelerators and its subsystems (including shielding
    materials and transmission values, calculations for various room configurations,
    duct impact on radiation protection), the radiological monitoring (measurements)
    and area control."
