abstract:
- content: 'ISO/IEC/IEEE 26512:2011 was developed to assist users of ISO/IEC 15288:2008
    or ISO/IEC 12207:2008 to acquire or supply software user documentation as part
    of the software life cycle processes. It defines the documentation process from
    the acquirer''s standpoint and the supplier''s standpoint. ISO/IEC/IEEE 26512:2011
    covers the requirements for information items used in the acquisition of user
    documentation products: the Acquisition Plan, Document Specification, Statement
    of Work, Request for Proposals, and the proposal. It provides an overview of the
    software user documentation and information management processes which may require
    acquisition and supply of software user documentation products and services. It
    addresses the preparation of requirements for software user documentation. These
    requirements are central to the user documentation specification and Statement
    of Work. It includes requirements for primary document outputs of the acquisition
    and supply process: the Request for Proposal and the Proposal for user documentation
    products and services. It also discusses the use of a Documentation Management
    Plan and a Document Plan as they arise in the acquisition and supply processes.
    ISO/IEC/IEEE 26512:2011 is independent of the software tools that may be used
    to produce documentation, and applies to both printed documentation and on-screen
    documentation. Much of its guidance is applicable to user documentation for systems
    including hardware as well as software.'
