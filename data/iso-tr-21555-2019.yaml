- content: |-
    This document provides an overview for selecting the most suitable test method regarding the evaluation of the hardness and the wear resistance of coatings.
    Annex A gives a summarized list of test methods for the evaluation of the hardness and of the wear resistance of coatings for different stresses.
    Methods for testing cross-linking (wear test in connection with solvents) and abrasion tests with multiple impacts are not covered by this document.
