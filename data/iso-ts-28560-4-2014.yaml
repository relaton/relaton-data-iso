abstract:
- content: |-
    ISO/TS 28560-4:2014 defines rules for ISO 28560‑1 data elements to be encoded in radio frequency identification (RFID) tags with a memory structure that is partitioned into four memory banks. This primarily applies to ISO/IEC 18000‑63 (previously known as ISO/IEC 18000‑6 Type C) operating in the UHF frequency, but not necessarily restricted to this technology.
    The rules for encoding a subset of data elements taken from the total set of data elements defined in ISO 28560‑1 are based on ISO/IEC 15962, which uses an object identifier structure to identify data elements. This part of ISO 28560 defines the rules for encoding a unique item identifier in a specific memory bank, known as MB 01, taking into account different requirements for privacy. It also defines the rules for encoding other relevant data in a separate memory bank, known as MB 11. Each of these memory banks is addressable using different command set of the appropriate RFID technology.
    As with other parts of ISO 28560, this part of ISO 28560 is appropriate for the needs of all types of libraries (including academic, public, corporate, special, and school libraries).
    ISO/TS 28560-4:2014 provides essential standards-based information about RFID in libraries. A source of additional information about implementation issues is provided in Annex A.
