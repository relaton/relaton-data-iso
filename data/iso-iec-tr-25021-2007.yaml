abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC TR 25021:2007 defines the set of quality measure elements to be
    used throughout the software product life cycle for the purpose of Software Product
    Quality Requirement and Evaluation (SQuaRE). While some quality measure elements
    can be used as standalone quality measures, their main purpose is to be the building
    blocks for other SQuaRE measurements as described in ISO/IEC TR 9126-2, ISO/IEC
    TR 9126-3 and ISO/IEC TR 9126-4. ISO/IEC TR 25021:2007 constitutes the link between
    ISO/IEC 9126 and the subsequent SQuaRE series of standards. \nISO/IEC TR 25021:2007
    contains informative annexes documenting the cross-reference relationship between
    the quality measure elements and quality measures, characteristics and subcharacteristics
    defined in ISO/IEC 9126.\nThe Quality Measurement Division, of which ISO/IEC TR
    25021:2007 is a member, also offers examples of quality measures that can be used
    across the product development life-cycle. These measures are defined in the other
    documents in the division and correspond to the quality characteristics in a software
    product quality model such as that described in the future International Standard
    ISO/IEC 25010 (replacing ISO/IEC 9126-1). ISO/IEC TR 25021:2007 is designed to
    be used, in particular, with other standards in the SQuaRE series that address
    quality requirements (ISO/IEC 25030) and product quality evaluation (the future
    International Standard ISO/IEC 25040)."
