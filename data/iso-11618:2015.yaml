    ISO 11618:2015 applies to sealants used for pedestrian walkways, public areas, movement joints between concrete slabs, areas with pedestrian load, areas which are used with trolleys, parking garages, walkable floors, balconies, terraces, and warehouses.
    This International Standard specifies the types and classes of elastic sealants used in building construction pedestrian walkways according to their performance characteristics. Sealant may be either non-sag or self-leveling as declared by the manufacturer. Areas of application are floor joints which have been designed.
    Chemical containment, cold applied joint sealants for concrete pavements to be used in roads, airfields, and sewage treatment plants are excluded.
    Local regulations may be required in addition to this International Standard based on local laws and codes.
