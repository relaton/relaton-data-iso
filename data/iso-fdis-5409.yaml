abstract:
- content: "This method applies to the sampling and determination of elemental mercury,
    oxidized mercury, particulate mercury, and total mercury from coal-ﬁred stationary
    sources. Although there are several methods for the measurement of mercury in
    flue gas, none of them are applicable for the measurement of mercury in sources
    with high particulate loadings. \nThe proposed method builds on the proven capabilities
    of existing sampling methods to overcome the challenges of mercury sampling in
    flue gases with high particulate loadings.  Validation work to date demonstrates
    that the method is suitable at a variety of measurement locations, including those
    with high particulate loadings in flue gas.\nThis method is suitable for locations
    where the ﬂue gas temperature is below 723 K.\nWhen the sampling volume is 500
    to 1500 l (dry basis corrected to standard conditions), the detection limit is
    0.1 μg/m3, the limit of determination is 0.4 μg/m3, and the best measurement range
    of mercury is 0.5 to 100 μg/m3."
