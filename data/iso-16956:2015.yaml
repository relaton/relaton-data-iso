  content: In the cooling and heating loads of a building, the air taken in from outside
    account for a large portion of the entire load; in order to estimate this load,
    it is necessary to correctly grasp the air flow rate of ventilation and air-conditioning
    systems. This International Standard stipulates the methods for measuring the
    rate of air flow through the ducts in a steadily operating ventilation and air-conditioning
    system and in the air control ports including air diffuser, suction opening, and
    exhaust opening.
