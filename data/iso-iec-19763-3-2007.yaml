    ISO/IEC 19763 specifies a metamodel framework for interoperability. ISO/IEC 19763-3:2007 specifies the metamodel that is intended to promote interoperation among application systems based on ontologies.
    The metamodel specified by ISO/IEC 19763-3:2007 provides a facility to register administrative information related to ontologies, which consist of several sentences that use several non-logical symbols, irrespective of the languages in which they are described. The metamodel also distinguishes a reference ontology, an ontology that is usable and sharable by a community of interest, and a local ontology, an ontology that is specialized for defined applications.
    The metamodel, together with repositories that contain actual ontologies, makes it possible for users to gain the benefits of interoperation among application systems based on ontologies.
