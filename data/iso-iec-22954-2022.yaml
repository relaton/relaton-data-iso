    This document specifies a method of automated colour profile distribution to large format inkjet printers.
    This document applies to digital colour printers and their printer controllers for which ICC colour management is necessary or desired. This document also applies to the print settings profile providers.
    The extent of automation covered includes the printer controller acquiring information about the overall situation, connecting to a print settings profile provider on the Internet, determining the best possible profile to download (if it exists), and downloading and installation of the profile.
    This document covers general concepts and procedures and does not go into a level of detail necessary to establish syntactic or semantic interoperability. This document covers ICC version 4 output profiles as specified by ISO 15076-1, but does not cover device link profiles.
