  content: "The following are within the scope of this part of ISO 15926:\n\n—\tidentification
    of a reference data item specified in ISO 15926-4; \n\n—\tinformation that defines
    a reference data item;\n\n—\tthe way identification and defining information data
    are recorded using ISO 15926-2; \n—\tthe reference data library that contains
    the reference data items necessary to record identification and defining information;\n\n—\tthe
    representation of the reference data library that is defined by this part of ISO
    15926 as a spreadsheet;\n\nThe following are outside the scope of this part of
    ISO 15926:\n—\tadministrative information  about the source, the history of changes,
    and current status of a reference data and a reference data library;\n—\tthe way
    administrative data are recorded using ISO 15926-2; \n—\tthe reference data library
