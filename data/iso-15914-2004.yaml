    ISO 15914:2004 specifies a method for the enzymatic determination of the total starch content of animal feeding stuffs and raw materials for animal feeding stuffs.
    The method is also applicable to the determination of starch in starch.
    It is important that in the sample matrix no components are present which contribute to the measured extinction at 340 nm.
    The analytical range of the method is 40 g/kg to 1 000 g/kg starch. The standard procedure is applicable to the range 200 g/kg to 1000 g/kg. For the lower range, 40 g/kg to 200 g/kg, another dilution procedure for the standard glucose solution and samples can be used.
