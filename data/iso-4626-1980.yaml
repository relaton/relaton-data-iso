abstract:
- content: This method is applicable to organic liquids that boil between 30 and 300
    C at normal pressure, and that are chemically stable and do not corrode the apparatus
    during the distillation such as hydrocarbons, esters, alcohols, ketones, ethers
    and similar products. The principle consists in distillation of a 100 ml test
    portion under prescribed conditions, systematic observation of thermometer readings
    and volumes of condensate and calculation of the results from these data with
    correction to standard atmospheric pressure.
