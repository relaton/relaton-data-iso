  content: This part specifies a method for the determination of hygroexpansivity
    when the paper or board is subjected to a change in the relative humidity with
    which it is in equilibrium from (33 2) % to (84 2) %. The purpose is to cover
    applications of paper and board intended to be used in high humidity conditions.
    It may also be useful in determining the effect of excessive moisture to which
    paper may be subjected for short periods during some printing processes. The method
    is generally applicable. However, it is not suitable for cr pe papers and corrugated
    fibreboard.
