abstract:
- content: "ISO/TS 10303-1602:2006 specifies the application module for\n         Altered

    deals with the\trepresentation of the properties of a component that has had some
    \n            \t\tpreparation work done to it, which modifies the form or fit
    or function or material properties of the component and is usually\n            installed
    in the product to be delivered to a customer. \n            \t   The preparation
    work may be necessary to facilitate the installation, or to support alternate
    mounting arrangements, or\n            to implement a program in a field programmable
    device. \n            \t   This module does not distinguish between the properties
    of a component that has been altered prior to installation and\n            the
