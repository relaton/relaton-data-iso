abstract:
- content: "ISO 18431-1:2005 defines the mathematical transformations, including the
    physical units, that convert each category of vibration and shock data into a
    form that is suitable for quantitative comparison between experiments and for
    quantitative specifications. It is applicable to the analysis of vibration that
    is deterministic or random, and transient or continuous signals. The categories
    of signals are defined in Clause 6. \nExtreme care is to be exercised to identify
    correctly the type of signal being analysed in order to use the correct transformation
    and units, especially with the frequency domain analysis. \nThe data may be obtained
    experimentally from measurements of a mechanical structure or obtained from numerical
    simulation of a mechanical structure. This category of data is very broad because
    there is a wide variety of mechanical structures, for example, microscopic instruments,
    musical instruments, automobiles, manufacturing machines, buildings and civil
    structures. The data can determine the response of machines or of humans to mechanical
    vibration and shock."
