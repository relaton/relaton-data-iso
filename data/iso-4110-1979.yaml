abstract:
- content: Specifies a method for determining the consistency of fresh concrete by
    means of the Vebe test. The method is considered particularly useful for concrete
    with low workability. It is not suitable for concrete with a maximum size of aggregate
    greater than 40 mm. Describes apparatus, procedure, expression of results, and
    test report.
