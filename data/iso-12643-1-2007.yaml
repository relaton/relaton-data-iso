abstract:
- content: "ISO 12643-1:2007 provides safety specifications for the design and construction
    of new machines used in printing press systems and in binding and finishing systems.
    It includes equipment used in a stand-alone mode, or in combination with other
    machines, including ancillary equipment, in which all the machine actuators (e.g.
    drives) of the equipment are controlled by the same control system. \nThe requirements
    listed in ISO 12643-1:2007 are applicable to the equipment covered by all parts
    of ISO 12643, unless otherwise noted. Requirements specific to press and binding
    and finishing equipment and systems, that are not included in ISO 12643-1:2007,
    are given in ISO 12643-2 and ISO 12643-3, respectively.\nISO 12643-1:2007 addresses
    recognized hazards specific to equipment and systems in the following areas:\n-
    mechanical;\n- electrical;\n- slipping, tripping, falling;\n- ergonomics;\n- noise;\n-
    radiation;\n- fire and explosion;\n- thermal;\n- other emissions.\nIt is advisable
    that technologies not identified in ISO 12643-1:2007 incorporate the safety principles
    set forth herein in their design."
