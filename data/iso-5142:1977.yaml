  content: Applicable to products in which not all impurities are known or determined.
    The methods specified in ISO 3237 cannot be applied. The principle consists in
    dissolution of a test portion, removal of insoluble matter, iron, aluminium and
    calcium from the solution and evaporation to dryness in the presence of sulphuric
    acid. Heating and weighing of the total amount. Calculation of the sodium sulphate
    content by subtraction of the amount arising from any sodium chloride and sodium
    carbonate. Has also been approved by the IUPAC.
