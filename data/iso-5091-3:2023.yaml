    This document specifies the standards for design and construction using the bottom-surface (soffit) underlaying method. Bottom-surface (soffit) underlaying is a method whereby reinforcing materials are placed on the bottom surface of the slabs or beams whose performance is lower than required and the improvement of durability, serviceability, safety and other performance of the members is achieved by the integrity between the reinforcing materials and existing members.
    This document specifies structural intervention of existing concrete structures using cementitious materials design and execution principles, and strategies for defects and on-going deterioration including, but not limited to:
    a)       mechanical actions, e.g. fatigue, impact, overloading, movement caused by settlement, blast, vibration, and seismic actions;
    b)       chemical and biological actions from environments, e.g. sulfate attack, alkali-aggregate reaction;
    c)        physical actions, e.g. freeze–thaw, thermal cracking, moisture movement, salt crystallization, fire, and erosion;
    d)       reinforcement corrosion;
    e)       original construction defects that remained unaddressed from the time of construction.
