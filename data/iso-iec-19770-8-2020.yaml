    This document defines requirements, guidelines, formats and approaches for use when producing a mapping document that defines how industry practices map to/from the ISO/IEC 19770 series.
    This edition is focused solely on mappings to/from both the second edition of ISO/IEC 19770-1 that was published in 2012, or the third edition of ISO/IEC 19770-1 that was published in 2017. However, the title of this document is deliberately more general as it is expected that future editions of this document also include mapping frameworks related to other parts of the ISO/IEC 19770 series.
    In this document where reference is made to ISO/IEC 19770-1 without the specification of an edition number or a publication year, then the text applies to all editions of ISO/IEC 19770-1.
