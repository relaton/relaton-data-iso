  content: ISO 2834-2:2015 specifies a test method for preparation of test prints
    produced with liquid water-based or solvent-based printing inks as used in flexography
    and gravure printing. These test prints are intended primarily for optical tests,
    such as gloss, colorimetry, transparency and reflection density. They can also
    be used for testing light fastness and the chemical, physical and mechanical resistance
    to mechanical and chemical attack regarding either printing ink and/or substrate.
    Flexographic inks with higher viscosity, such as those cured by radiation, are
    also covered. This part of ISO 2834 is not applicable to inks for ink jet printing.
