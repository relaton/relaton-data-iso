    ISO 14794:2011 specifies open-loop test methods for determining the effect of braking on the course-holding and directional behaviour of heavy vehicles or heavy vehicle combinations when braking is accomplished using
    -               the service-brake system, or
    -               the retarder or engine brake only.
    ISO 14794:2011 is applicable to heavy vehicles, i.e. commercial vehicles, commercial vehicle combinations, buses and articulated buses as defined in ISO 3833, covered by Categories M3, N2, N3, O3 and O4 of UNECE (United Nations Economic Commission for Europe) and EC vehicle regulations. These categories pertain to trucks and trailers with a maximum mass above 3,5 t and to buses and articulated buses with a maximum mass above 5 t.
