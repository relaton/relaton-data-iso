abstract:
- content: ISO/TS 21667:2004 establishes a common health indicators conceptual framework
    for the field of health informatics. It is intended to foster a common vocabulary
    and conceptual definitions for a framework which defines the appropriate dimensions
    and subdimensions required to describe the health of the population and performance
    of a health care system, which is sufficiently broad (high-level) to accommodate
    a variety of health care systems, and which is comprehensive, encapsulating all
    of the factors that are related to health outcomes and health system performance
    and utilization, and regional and national variations. ISO/TS 21667:2004 does
    not identify or describe individual indicators or specific data elements for the
    health indicators conceptual framework. The definition of benchmarks and/or approaches
    used in the definition of benchmarks is outside its scope.
