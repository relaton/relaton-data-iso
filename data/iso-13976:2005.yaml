    ISO 13976:2005 applies to hot-rolled carbon/manganese steel sheet of structural quality,without the use of microalloying elements. The product is intended for structural purposes where particular mechanical properties are required. It is generally used in the delivered condition and is intended for bolted, riveted or welded structures. The product is produced on a wide strip mill.

    This product is commonly produced in the range of thicknesses greater than 6 mm to 25 mm, and widths of 600 mm and over, in coils.
