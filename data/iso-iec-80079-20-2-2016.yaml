  content: "ISO/IEC 80079-20-2:2016 is published as a dual logo standard and describes
    the test methods for the identification of combustible dust and combustible dust
    layers in order to permit classification\nof areas where such materials exist
    for the purpose of the proper selection and installation of electrical and mechanical
    equipment for use in the presence of combustible dust. The standard     \natmospheric
    conditions for determination of characteristics of combustible dusts are:\n- temperature
    -20 °C to 60 °C,\n- pressure 80 kPa (0,8 bar) to 110 kPa (1,1 bar) and\n- air
    with normal oxygen content, typically 21 % v/v. The test methods defined do not
    apply to:\n- recognized explosives, propellants (e.g. gunpowder, dynamite), or
    substances or mixtures of substances which may, under some circumstances, behave
    in a similar manner or\n- dusts of explosives and propellants that do not require
    atmospheric oxygen for combustion, or to pyrophoric substances. This first edition
    cancels and replaces the first edition of IEC 61241-2-1 published in 1994, the
    first edition of IEC 61241-2-2 published in 1993 and the first edition of IEC
    61241-2-3 published in 1994, combining the requirements into a single document,
    and is considered to constitute a technical revision. Significant changes with
    respect to IEC 61241-2-1:1994, IEC 61241-2-2:1993 and IEC 61241-2-3:1994 can be
    found in the foreword of the document.      \nKeywords: combustible dust"
