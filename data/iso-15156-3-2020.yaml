abstract:
- content: |-
    This document gives requirements and recommendations for the selection and qualification of CRAs (corrosion-resistant alloys) and other alloys for service in equipment used in oil and natural gas production and natural gas treatment plants in H2S-containing environments whose failure can pose a risk to the health and safety of the public and personnel or to the environment. It can be applied to help avoid costly corrosion damage to the equipment itself. It supplements, but does not replace, the materials requirements of the appropriate design codes, standards, or regulations.
    This document addresses the resistance of these materials to damage that can be caused by sulfide stress cracking (SSC), stress corrosion cracking (SCC), and galvanically induced hydrogen stress cracking (GHSC).
    This document is concerned only with cracking. Loss of material by general (mass loss) or localized corrosion is not addressed.
    Table 1 provides a non-exhaustive list of equipment to which this document is applicable, including exclusions.
    This document applies to the qualification and selection of materials for equipment designed and constructed using load controlled design methods. For design utilizing strain-based design methods, see ISO 15156‑1:2020, Clause 5.
    This document is not necessarily suitable for application to equipment used in refining or downstream processes and equipment.
