  content: "This document specifies a formal description of the manufacturing change
    management (MCM) processes to provide an organizational and technical solution
    for the comprehensive mapping and processing of changes between production planning
    and operations. The aim of this document is to uniformly capture and track change
    measures, and to sensibly forecast and coordinate the capacities required for
    change processes in the planning and production departments. \nThis document presents
    a data-oriented view for implementation of MCM. The most important aspect of the
    data-oriented view is that the central change element is linked to the objects
    of the digital factory (i.e. the process, the product and the resource). The basis
    for MCM and the different views presented in this document are production planning
    processes. \nISO/TR 18828‑1 gives an overview of the ISO 18828 series and links
    the MCM to the other parts of ISO 18828, focussing on production planning processes,
    as well as information flows and key performance indicators. The following aspects
    are covered within this document:\n—                                      processes
    of MCM;\n—                                      roles in MCM;\n—                                      data-oriented
    view of MCM;\n—                                      workflow of MCM."
