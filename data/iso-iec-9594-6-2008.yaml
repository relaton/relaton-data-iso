  content: |-
    ISO/IEC 9594-6:2008 defines a number of attribute types and matching rules which may be found useful across a range of applications of the Directory.
    Attribute types and matching rules fall into the following three categories:
    - Some attribute types and matching rules are used by a wide variety of applications or are understood and/or used by the Directory itself. (It is recommended that an attribute type or matching rule defined in ISO/IEC 9594-6:2008 be used, in preference to the generation of a new one, whenever it is appropriate for the application.)
    - Some attribute types and matching rules are internationally standardized, but are application-specific. These are defined in the standards associated with the application concerned.
    - Any administrative authority can define its own attribute types and matching rules for any purpose. These are not internationally standardized, and are available to others beyond the administrative authority which created them only by bilateral agreement.
