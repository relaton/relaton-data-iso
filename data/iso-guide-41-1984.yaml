abstract:
- content: Packaging is a product of consumer interest, the cost of which is borne
    indirectly by the consumer. Standardization of packaging should, therefore, address
    itself to such factors as safety, health, fitness of purpose, comfort and reliability,
    as well as such general needs as protection of the environment and energy conservation.
    When drafting a standard relating to packaging, the requirements set out in this
    Guide in the order of priority should be taken into consideration.
