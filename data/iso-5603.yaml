    ISO 5603:2017 specifies two methods for determining the adhesion strength of vulcanized rubber to wire cord which is embedded in the rubber.
    The two methods do not necessarily give the same results.
    They are applicable primarily to test pieces prepared in the laboratory under standard conditions and used for the development and control of materials and processes utilized in the manufacture of products reinforced with wire cord.
    NOTE The methods can also be used for single wire, for example bead wire.
    Method 1 reduces the dependence of the measured adhesion on the modulus and strength properties of the rubber.
