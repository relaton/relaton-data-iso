abstract:
- content: 'The methods of quantitative analysis of mixtures of textile fibres are
    based on two processes: the manual separation and the chemical separation of fibre
    types. The method of manual separation should be used whenever possible, since
    it generally gives more accurate results. In general, the methods for quantitative
    chemical analysis of mixtures or textile fibres are based on the selective solutin
    of individual components of the mixture. Four variants of this procedure are possible.'
