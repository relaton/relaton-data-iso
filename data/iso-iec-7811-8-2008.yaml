  content: "ISO/IEC 7811-8:2008 is one of a series of International Standards defining
    the characteristics of identification cards. It provides criteria to which cards
    shall perform and specifies the requirements for such cards used for international
    interchange. It takes into consideration both human and machine aspects and states
    minimum requirements.\nISO/IEC 7811-8:2008 specifies requirements for a 51,7 kA/m
    (650 Oe) magnetic stripe (including any protective overlay) on an identification
    card. This magnetic stripe is between ISO/IEC 7811-2 (23,9 kA/m, 300 Oe) and ISO/IEC
    7811-6 (minimum 199 kA/m, 2500 Oe) in terms of coercivity and is primarily used
    for hotel guest room entry systems worldwide. ISO/IEC 7811-8:2007 specifies the
    \"window\" to be used to establish given values for 51,7 kA/m (650 Oe) media,
    the main difference being in the Imin (6,5 FR) and Imax (8 FR) values which define
    the extremities of the window. Encoding techniques, specification, error detection,
    and track locations are not specified in ISO/IEC 7811-8:2007. \nISO/IEC 7811-8:2008
    specifies\n- the conditions for conformance,\n- physical characteristics for the
    card (warpage and surface distortions) and the magnetic stripe area (location,
    height and surface profile, roughness, adhesion, wear, and resistance to chemicals),\n-
    the signal amplitude performance characteristics of the magnetic stripe.\nThe
    encoding specification, angle of recording, bit density, flux transition spacing
    variation, signal amplitude, data structure including track format, use of error
    correction techniques, and the location of encoded tracks are not specified, but
    are recommended to be the same as ISO/IEC 7811-2 where appropriate.\nISO/IEC 7811-8:2008,
    together with a standard for test methods, provides for interchange between various
    types of identification card processing devices and systems."
