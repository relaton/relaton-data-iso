abstract:
- content: 'ISO/IEC 15018:2004 specifies a generic cabling for three groups of applications
    in homes: Information and Communications Technologies (ICT), Broadcast and Communications
    Technologies (BCT), and Commands, Controls and Communications in Buildings (CCCB).
    It is intended to guide installations in new buildings or refurbishments, and
    also applies where cabling is installed to support only one or two of the three
    application groups listed above. A generic cabling infrastructure is specified
    based upon balanced cabling and / or coaxial cabling. ICT channels specified in
    this standard include optical fibre, but the wider use of fibre optical cabling
    in a home is for further study. The three groups of applications may also be supported
    by different types of cabling, which may be subject to other International Standards.
    For example, ISO/IE cabling for ICT applications in general for the office environment.
    While the cabling structure and reference implementations are matched to the home
    environment in ISO/IEC 15018:2004, the channel performances specified for ICT
    are identical to those specified in ISO/IEC 11801.'
