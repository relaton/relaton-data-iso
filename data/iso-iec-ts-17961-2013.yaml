    ISO/IEC TS 17961:2013 specifies
    - rules for secure coding in the C programming language, and
    - code examples.
    ISO/IEC TS 17961:2013 does not specify
    - the mechanism by which these rules are enforced, or
    - any particular coding style to be enforced.
    Each rule in this Technical Specification is accompanied by code examples. Two distinct kinds of examples are provided:
    - noncompliant examples demonstrating language constructs that have weaknesses with potentially exploitable security implications; such examples are expected to elicit a diagnostic from a conforming analyzer for the affected language construct; and
    - compliant examples are expected not to elicit a diagnostic.
