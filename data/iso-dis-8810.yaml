    This document specifies a method for determination of di-tert-butyl peroxide (DTBP) and 2, 5-Dimethyl-2, 5-di (tert-butylperoxy) hexane (DBPH) in plastic by using gas chromatography.

    This document is applicable to the determination of the content of residual peroxides in plastics and their products, which using the peroxides as a degradation agent or crosslinking agent during plastic processing, or as an additive during polymerization, thereby remaining in degraded polypropylene, crosslinked polyethylene, polystyrene and other plastics.
