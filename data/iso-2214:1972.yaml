abstract:
- content: The principle consists in removal of the boron by evaporation with methanol
    and separation of manganese and other metals from the residue, by extraction with
    chloroform, as their diethyldithiocarbamates. Wet destruction of the diethyldithiocarbamates
    with a sulphuric acid/ hydrogen peroxide mixture. Removal of any interfering iron
    by extraction as the thiocyanate. Formation of the coloured manganese formaldoxime
    complex in alkaline solution and photometric measurement at a wavelength of approximately
    450 nm.
