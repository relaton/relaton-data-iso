    This document specifies dimensions for lubrication holes, grooves and pockets for bearing bushes. These dimensions can be entered, for example on drawings, using the designation examples. Their use depends in particular on the specific operating conditions.
    In addition, it enables the user to assign the different types of lubricant feed and distribution to solid and steel-backed plain bearing bushes made of copper alloys, aluminium alloys, thermosetting plastics, thermoplastics or artificial carbon.
    NOTE    Different types of lubricant feed and distribution for plain bearing bushes made of sintered metals have not been specified due to the fact that these bushes are soaked with lubricant. Plain bearing bushes made of artificial carbon are not lubricated with oil or grease.
