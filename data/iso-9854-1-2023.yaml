    This document specifies two general test methods, Method A and Method B, to be used for the determination of the impact properties of unnotched and notched specimens cut from thermoplastics pipes for the transport of fluids.
    —     Method A: unnotched method, for unnotched specimens cut from thermoplastics pipes for the transport of fluids.
    —     Method B: notched method, for specimens cut from thermoplastics pipes for the transport of fluids, into which a notch has been machined.
    The use of Method A or Method B is determined by the relevant product standards.
    This document is not intended as a reference test method for the determination of the impact strength of pipes. ISO 3127, relating to the determination of the impact strength of pipes by means of a falling mass, is the reference test method. However, this document can be used for scientific research, materials testing or the examination of pipe when it is not possible to take measurements in accordance with the reference method.
    This document can be applied to either isolated batches or continuous production of pipe.
