    The aim of this document is to achieve designs of plain bearings that are reliable in operation, by the application of a calculation method for oil-lubricated hydrodynamic plain bearings with complete separation of the thrust collar and plain bearing surfaces by a film of lubricant[1].
    This document applies to plain thrust bearings with incorporated wedge and supporting surfaces having any ratio of wedge surface length lwed to length of one pad L. It deals with the value lwed/L = 0,75 as this value represents the optimum ratio[2]. The ratio of width to length of one pad can be varied in the range B/L = 0,5 to 2.
    The calculation method described in this document can be used for other incorporated gap shapes, e.g. plain thrust bearings with integrated baffle, when for these types the numerical solutions of Reynolds equation are known.
    The calculation method serves for designing and optimizing plain thrust bearings e.g. for fans, gear units, pumps, turbines, electrical machines, compressors and machine tools. It is limited to steady-state conditions, i.e. load and angular speed of all rotating parts are constant under continuous operating conditions. Dynamic operating conditions are not included.
