abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "ISO/IEC 25040:2011 contains requirements and recommendations for the evaluation
    of software product quality and clarifies the general concepts. It provides a
    process description for evaluating software product quality and states the requirements
    for the application of this process. The evaluation process can be used for different
    purposes and approaches. The process can be used for the evaluation of the quality
    of pre-developed software, commercial-off-the-shelf software or custom software
    and can be used during or after the development process. \nISO/IEC 25040:2011
    establishes the relationship of the evaluation reference model to the SQuaRE documents
    as well as shows how each SQuaRE document should be used during the activities
    of the evaluation process.\nIt is intended for those responsible for software
    product evaluation and is appropriate for developers, acquirers and independent
    evaluators of software products. These three different approaches are detailed
    in ISO/IEC 14598-3, ISO/IEC 14598-4, and ISO/IEC 14598-5.\nIt is not intended
    for evaluation of other aspects of software products (such as functional requirements,
    process requirements, business requirements, etc.). "
