- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: This document specifies the minimum technical requirements and performance
    characteristics for the detection of molecular nucleic acid (DNA or RNA) sequences
    of specific microorganisms present in water using molecular detection methods
    based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR). This includes guidelines for validation
    of PCR related methods (inclusivity, exclusivity, specificity, limits of detection
    and quantification, linearity, robustness, recovery, and calibration). This document
    describes also topics related to quality control which are in general related
    to the use of PCR related methods, including on-site PCR systems and methods.
    This document is applicable to all kinds of water including potable, industrial,
    waste, and natural waters.
