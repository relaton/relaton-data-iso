    This document specifies a large bag sampling method for measuring volatile organic compounds (VOCs), formaldehyde and other carbonyl compounds which are emitted from vehicle interior parts into the air inside road vehicles. This method is intended for evaluation of large new vehicle interior parts, and complete assemblies. This is a screening method to compare similar car components under similar test conditions on a routine basis.
    Evaluating VOC emissions of vehicle interior parts is an important aspect of the vehicle indoor air quality.
    This document is complementary to existing standards and provides test laboratories and the manufacturing industry with a cost-effective evaluation of vehicle interior parts. This method is only applicable to newly manufactured vehicle parts. This method is applicable to all types of vehicles, and vehicle products which are used as parts in the interior of vehicles.
