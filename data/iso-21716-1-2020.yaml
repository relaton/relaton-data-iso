    This document specifies general requirements and common specifications for preparing and aging panels coated with anti-fouling paint to perform laboratory bioassay screening tests against specified organisms. Such tests are given in the other parts of the ISO 21716 series, with which this document is intended to be used.
    This document is applicable to all anti-fouling paints that prevent or deter the attachment and growth of sessile organisms on a surface through chemical or biological means.
    It is not applicable to the following:
    —     coatings that deter or prevent fouling solely by physical means such as biocide-free foul release paints;
    —     anti-fouling methods used for controlling harmful marine organisms and pathogenic organisms in ships' ballast water and sediments according to IMO International Convention for the Control and Management of Ships' Ballast Water and Sediments, 2004[7].
