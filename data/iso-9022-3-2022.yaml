    This document specifies the methods relating to the environmental tests of optical instruments including additional assemblies from other fields (e.g. mechanical, chemical, and electronic devices), under equivalent conditions, for their ability to resist the influence of mechanical stress.
    The purpose of the testing is to investigate to what extent the optical, climatic, mechanical, chemical, and electrical (including electrostatic) performance characteristics of the specimen are affected by mechanical stress.
