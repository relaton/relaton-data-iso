    The scope of this project supports the collection of terms, definitions, examples and notes to entry corresponding to the sub subject field nuclear installations, processes and technologies.
    This is the version corresponding to the systematic review of the ISO 12749-3:2015 which scope has been changed due to the new scope of the ISO/TC85/SC5 that covers not only the nuclear fuel cycle, but also the installations, processes and technologies related to the nuclear fuel.
    The project will be carried out according to the standards developed by ISO/TC37 as follows: ISO 704:2009 "Terminology work - Principles and methods", ISO 1087:2019 "Terminology work and terminology science - Vocabulary", ISO 10241-1:2011 "Terminological entries in standards - Part 1: General requirements and examples of presentation", ISO 15188:2001 "Project management guidelines for terminology standardization" and ISO 860:2007 "Terminology work - Harmonization of concepts and terms".
