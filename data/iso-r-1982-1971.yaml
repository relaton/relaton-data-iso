  content: The method is applicable to the determination of iron contents greater
    than 0,0001 % (m/m). The principle consists in evaporation of a test portion,
    taking up by means of hydrochloric acid and reduction of iron(III) by means of
    hydroxylammonium chloride. Formation of iron(II)-2,2' -dipyridyl complex in ammonium
    acetate medium. Photometric measurement of the coloured complex at a wavelength
    of about 522 nm.
