  content: "ISO 22609:2004 describes a laboratory test method for measuring the \nresistance
    of medical face masks to penetration by a splash of synthetic \nblood.\nISO 22609:2004
    primarily addresses the performance of materials or certain \nmaterial constructions
    used in medical face masks. The test method does not \naddress the performance
    of the medical face mask's design, construction, \ninterfaces or other factors
    which may affect the overall protection offered by \nthe medical face mask and
    its operation (such as filtration efficiency and \npressure drop).\nISO 22609:2004
    does not evaluate the performance of medical face masks as a \nprotection against
    contamination via airborne exposure pathways or in the \nprevention of the penetration
    of aerosolized body fluids deposited on the \nmedical face mask."
