    ISO 4952:2006 specifies the chemical and mechanical characteristics, the methods of manufacture, the acceptance conditions and the marking of structural steel products with improved atmospheric corrosion resistance.
    ISO 4952:2006 applies to plates hot-rolled on reversing mills, having a thickness of 4 mm and over, wide flats, bars, and hot-rolled sections, generally used in the delivery condition and which, as a rule, form part of the bolted, riveted or welded structures in metal constructions and which have an improved atmospheric corrosion resistance.
