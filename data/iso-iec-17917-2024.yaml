    This standard gives guidance on establishing a decision-making framework for sharing data and information services in smart cities.
    It covers:
    a)       types of data in smart cities;
    b)       establishing a data sharing culture;
    c)       data value chain – roles and responsibilities;
    d)       purposes for data use;
    e)       assessing data states;
    f)        defining access rights for data; and
    g)       data formats/format of transportation.
    This standard aims to support the sharing of data and information services within cities. For some cities there will also be a need to establish specific data sharing agreements, particularly where data is being shared by multiple organizations at once.
    This standard supports a transparent approach to making decisions and creating specific data sharing agreements in order to fully realise the benefits and value of data and information services in a city.
    Missing data or misinterpretation of data can lead to the wrong actions being taken by city decision-makers. A decision-making framework for sharing data can help ensure that they have the best overall data on which to base decisions.
    This standard does not cover:
    a)       national security issues;
    b)       good practice for use of data by the citizen;
    c)       existing interoperability agreements between cities;
    d)       defining application programming interfaces (API) networks; or
    e)       any data sharing rules and regulations specific to a particular jurisdiction. It is assumed that a security-minded approach to data sharing is used by cities.
    NOTE 1 Further details on the areas not covered in this standard, including information on relevant standards publications, are given in Annex A.
    This standard is for use by decision-makers in smart cities from the public, private and third sectors. It is also of interest to any city organization wishing to share data.
