  content: 'Gives a general definition of weldability, taking into consideration all
    the welding processes and taking note of all the different types of construction
    whatever properties they may have. As it includes all possibilities resulting
    from the combination of the four variables: material, process, type of construction
    and purpose, it should be possible to deduce any particular definition.'
