    ISO 14788:2017 is applicable to the minimum requirements for steel sheet, in coils and cut lengths, metallic-coated by the continuous hot-dip process, with zinc-5 % aluminium alloy coating.
    The product is intended for applications requiring corrosion resistance, formability and paintability.
    The steel sheet is produced in a number of quality designations and grades, coating type, coating mass, surface treatments and coating finish conditions designed to be compatible with differing application requirements.
