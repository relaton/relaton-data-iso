  content: "This document defines methods for the objective measurement of the print
    quality characteristics that contribute to the perceived resolution of reflection
    mode monochrome printed pages produced by digital electro-photographic printers.
    The measurement methods of this document are derived from several existing techniques
    for the assessment of an imaging system's resolution characteristics. Each of
    these measurement methods is intended for the engineering evaluation of a printing
    system's perceived resolution and is not intended to be used for purposes of advertising
    claims.\nThe methods of this document are applicable only to monochrome prints
    produced in reflection mode by electro-photographic printing technology. This
    document is intended for monochrome printers utilizing PostScript®[1] interpreters
    capable of accepting PostScript and encapsulated PostScript (EPS) jobs.\n[1] PostScript®
