    The Document Printing Application is one component of a coordinated set of facilities and standards needed to
    satisfy the printing requirements of the modern distributed office. Together, the capabilities provided can enable
    users to create and produce high-quality office documents in a consistent and unambiguous manner within a
    distributed open systems environment.
    The Document Printing Application Standard (ISO/IEC 10175) consists of three parts:
    Part 1: Abstract service definitions and procedures
    Part 2: Protocol specification
    Part 3: Management abstract service definition and procedures
    This part of ISO/IEC 10175 extends the facilities specified in ISO/IEC 10175-1 by adding the capability for
    administrators and operators to manage and control printers, print servers and all other print objects; in addition, this
    part specifies additional capabilities for a print client to control a print job. The text and specifications contained in
    this part of ISO/IEC 10175 are derived from IEEE 1387.4 (POSIX) - System Administration Part 4 - Printing
    Interfaces. In particular, this part of ISO/IEC 10175:
    - specifies additional administrative functions and services that may be provided by Document Printing
    Application servers;
    - specifies the Document Printing Application abstract service for the additional administrative functions
    using the principles established by the Abstract Service Definition Conventions (ISO/IEC 10021-3);
    - specifies the requirements for conformance with the Document Printing Application for these additional
    administrative functions.
    See clause 1 of ISO/IEC 10175-1 for a more extensive description of the Document Printing Application.
