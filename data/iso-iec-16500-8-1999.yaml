    This part of ISO/IEC 16500 describes the management architecture and protocol for managing the DAVIC
    System. The DAVIC system management architecture is the TMN-based (Telecommunication Management
    Network) architecture defined in ITU-T Recommendation M.3010. This management architecture allows for
    automatic administration, configuration, monitoring, billing, and maintenance of the Service Provider System, the
    Delivery System, and the Consumer System over the DAVIC S5 flows. In accordance with DAVIC 1.3.1a Part 4
    and ISO/IEC 16500-5, the content of these flows is based on either the CMIP protocol or the SNMP protocol,
    depending on the complexity of the underlying subsystem or the preference of the network provider. SNMP
    MIBs (Management Information Base) for managing the STU and the Server have been defined in ISO/IEC
    16500-5. Usage related information models have also been defined in ISO/IEC 16500-9 using both CMISE and
    SNMP. For managing the ATM, SDH/SONET components of the Core Network of the DAVIC Delivery System,
    CMISE models defined in ITU-T and ATM Forum are recommended in ISO/IEC 16500-5 subclause 10.5.3.
    Taking into account that the current DAVIC specification for the Access Network is ATM-based 1, this Part of
    ISO/IEC 16500 defines CMISE information models for managing the DAVIC Access Network and servicerelated
    data in the Delivery System. In the future, if DAVIC specifications allow altenative access technologies
    (such as IP-based), additional system management information models (such as SNMP MIB) may be needed. The
    management of the coexistence of different access network technologies, using different protocols, could be
    achieved through interworking tools (i.e., interworking between CMIP and SNMP) as described in subclause 6.4.
    Tutorial information on a protocol-independent modeling technique is also provided in an informative annex.
    This part of ISO/IEC 16500 is organized as follows:
    This part of ISO/IEC 16500 refers to system architecture and interface information that are described in ISO/IEC
    16500 parts ?1, -5 and ?9 and in DAVIC 1.3.1a Part 4: Delivery system architecture and interface.
