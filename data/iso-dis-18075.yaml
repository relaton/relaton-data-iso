    ISO 18075:2018 provides guidance for performing and validating the sequence of steady-state calculations leading to prediction, in all types of operating UO2-fuel commercial nuclear reactors, of:
    - reaction-rate spatial distributions;
    - reactivity;
    - change of nuclide compositions with time.
    ISO 18075:2018 provides:
    a) guidance for the selection of computational methods;
    b) criteria for verification and validation of calculation methods used by reactor core analysts;
    c) criteria for evaluation of accuracy and range of applicability of data and methods;
    d) requirements for documentation of the preceding.
