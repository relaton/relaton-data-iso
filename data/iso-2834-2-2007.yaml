abstract:
- content: ISO 2834-2:2007 specifies a test method for preparation of test prints
    produced with liquid water-based or solvent-based printing inks as used in flexography
    and gravure printing. These test prints are intended primarily for optical tests,
    such as colorimetry, transparency and reflection density as described in ISO 2846-3
    and ISO 2846-5. They can also be used for testing gloss, light fastness and the
    chemical, physical and mechanical resistance to mechanical and chemical attack
    regarding either printing ink and/or substrate. Flexographic inks with higher
    viscosity, such as those cured by radiation are also covered. ISO 2834-2:2007
    is not applicable to inks for ink jet printing.
