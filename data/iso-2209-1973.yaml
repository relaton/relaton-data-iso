  content: 'These methods are applicable to products not contaminated by an axtraneous
    phase (for example, water). Accidental pollution is also considered. Three cases
    are considered: small containers, large containers and continuous sampling. The
    procedure consists in formation of a blended bulk sample, representing the whole
    of the batch, by mixing several samples. The number and the method of taking of
    the elementary samples will depend on the number and capacity of containers.'
