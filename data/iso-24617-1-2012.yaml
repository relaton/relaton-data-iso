abstract:
- content: 'Temporal information in natural language texts is an increasingly important
    component to the understanding of those texts. ISO 24617-1:2012, SemAF-Time, specifies
    a formalized XML-based markup language called ISO-TimeML, with a systematic way
    to extract and represent temporal information, as well as to facilitate the exchange
    of temporal information, both between operational language processing systems
    and between different temporal representation schemes. The use of guidelines for
    temporal annotation has been fully attested with examples from the TimeBank corpus,
    a collection of 183 documents that have been annotated by TimeML before the current
    version of ISO-TimeML was formulated. '
