    This document provides a guideline for the application of various available methods of treated wastewater (TWW) disinfection for an effective inactivation or removal of pathogens from TWW, which is intended for irrigation purposes.
    This document deals with:
    —    chemical and physical technologies, principles of operation, and establishment of effective doses to be applied, possible interferences, and technical guidance for design and monitoring;
    —    comparison of the advantages and disadvantages of various disinfection methods suitable for TWW;
    —    potential environmental effects of the disinfection methodologies and ways to minimize those impacts;
    —    disinfection at different locations in the TWW use system, including in the wastewater treatment plant, within the distribution system and at the point of use.
