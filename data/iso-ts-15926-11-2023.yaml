    This document enables a flexible creation of product knowledge models and data that supports systems engineering processes. The payload or design data can be exchanged across organizations or with the supply chain by combining resource description framework (RDF) triples, reference data dictionaries and a standardized set of relationships.
    This document is appropriate for use with the ISO 15926-series based reference data libraries, and it is applicable to the process industry, including oil, gas and power. However, manufacturing and aerospace industries can also benefit from this document.
    The following are within the scope of this document:
    —     process plants in accordance with ISO 15926-1;
    —     a methodology with low threshold for using reference data in combination with RDF triples for representing statements as defined in the ISO 15926 series;
    —     an initial set of relationships required for process plant life-cycle representation;
    —     a method to implement configuration management to trace back additions, changes and deletions in product and project data and enabling baselining;
    —     data sharing, integration, exchange, and hand-over between computer systems.
    The following are outside the scope of this document:
    —     serialisation methods;
    —     definition of reference data libraries;
    —     the syntax and format of implementations of either product data models or instance data using this document, or both;
    —     any specific methods and guidelines other than RDF(S) for implementing ISO 15926-2.
