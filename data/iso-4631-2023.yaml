abstract:
- content: This document specifies the procedures for testing the resistance to localized
    corrosion of biomedical Ti alloys fabricated via additive manufacturing (AM) method.
    This document defines the method of measuring the electrochemical critical localized
    corrosion potential (E-CLCP) of the AM Ti materials in aqueous environments, including
    biomedical solutions, for comparative evaluation of resistance to localized corrosion.
