abstract:
- content: To distinguish essential oils from fixed oils, the expression "oil of ..."
    shall be used. The commonly accepted trivial name of the plant shall follow these
    words. When no trivial name exists, the complete botanical name shall be used
    instead. If more than one part of the plant can be used for the extraction of
    essential oil, the name of the part employed shall follow the trivial name of
    the plant. If necessary the name of the country or area the plants are coming
    from shall precede the trivial name and the method used for obtaining the essential
    oil shall be indicated after a comma at the end of the title. Examples for English
    and French nomenclature are given.
