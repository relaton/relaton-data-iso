abstract:
- content: "ISO 17363:2007 defines the usage of read/write radio-frequency identification
    technology (RFID) cargo shipment-specific tags on freight containers for supply
    chain management purposes (shipment tags). It defines the air-interface communications,
    a common set of required data structures, and a commonly organized set of optional
    data requirements (through common syntax and semantics).\nIt contains recommendations
    about a containerized cargo supply chain RFID system, based on shipment tags;
    specific recommendations about mandatory non-reprogrammable information on the
    shipment tag; and specific recommendations about optional, re-programmable information
    on the shipment tag. \nIdentified within ISO 17363:2007 are the air-interface
    and communication parameters for active radio-frequency identification communications
    using ISO/IEC 18000-7. \nISO 17363:2007 is applicable to freight containers as
    defined in ISO 668 and to freight containers that are not defined by other ISO
    standards. It complements ISO 10374 for permanent container license-plate tags.
    \nIt fully describes cargo shipment-specific tags.\nIt does not address smart
    container technologies affixed to, or inside, freight containers (e.g. sensors)
    for supply chain management purposes. "
