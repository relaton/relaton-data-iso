  content: Specifies a method for determining the ability of sheets and strips having
    a thickness from 0,2 up to 2 mm and a width of 90 mm or more to undergo plastic
    deformation in stretch drawing, The test is referred to as the modified Erichsen
    cupping test as, in the test as originally introduced, no blank holder pressure
    was used but, in the interests of obtaining greater consistency of results, this
    was changed.
