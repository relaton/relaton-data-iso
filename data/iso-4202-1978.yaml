  content: This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition (i.e. ISO 4202-1976).
    Specifies the dimensions of reduction sleeves with external 7/24 taper (Nos. 30,
    40, 45, 50 and 60) for tools with Morse taper shanks (Nos. 1 to 6). All these
    sleeves allow driving of tools having Morse taper shanks which have a tenon at
    the small end of the shanks. Some sleeves allow driving of tools having Morse
    taper shanks which have an axially tapped hole in the shank.
