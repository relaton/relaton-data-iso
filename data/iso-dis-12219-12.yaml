    This document specifies a test method which is intended to determine the fogging characteristics of synthetic PVC and polyurethane leathers that are used as trim materials in the interior of motor vehicles.
    The method may also be applicable to fluid, pasty, powdered or solid raw materials which are the basis for such trim materials or from which the materials are manufactured. The method may also be applicable to other materials and finished products.
