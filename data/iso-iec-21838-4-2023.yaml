- content: |-
    This document describes TUpper as an ontology that is conformant to the requirements specified for top-level ontologies in ISO/IEC 21838-1.
    This document describes TUpper as a resource designed to support ontology design, ontology integration, automated reasoning, and semantic integration of heterogeneous information systems.
    The following are within the scope of this document:
    —     definitions of classes and relations in the signature of TUpper;
    —     axiomatizations of TUpper in OWL 2 and CL;
    —     documentation of the conformity of TUpper to the requirements specified for top-level ontologies in ISO/IEC 21838-1;
    —     documentation of the methodology for specifying domain ontologies that conform to TUpper.
    The following are outside the scope of this document:
    —     specification of ontology languages, including the languages RDF, OWL and CL standardly used in ontology development;
    —     specification of methods for reasoning with ontologies;
    —     specification of translators between the notations of ontologies developed in different ontology languages.
