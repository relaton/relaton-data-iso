abstract:
- content: Specifies a method for determining the bleeding tendency of colourants
    incorporated in plastics. The test piece is placed between a colourless PVC-foil
    on the one side and a sheet of filtrating paper on the other side. A glass plate
    laid upon the stack provides a close contact between the test piece and the colour
    accepting layers. After a specified heating period the stack is divided into the
    layers and the colourant migration in assessed by visual inspection.
