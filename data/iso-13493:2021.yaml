    This document specifies the liquid chromatographic (LC) method for the determination of chloramphenicol content of muscle tissue of meat, including livestock and poultry.
    This document specifies the liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry method (LC-MS/MS) for the determination of chloramphenicol content of muscle tissue, casing, liver of meat and meat products, including livestock and poultry.
    This document specifies LC-MS/MS as the reference method.
    The LC method is suitable for the determination of chloramphenicol content greater than 6,5 mg/kg.
    LC-MS/MS is suitable for the determination of chloramphenicol content greater than 0,1 μg/kg.
    Test samples which have deteriorated cannot be analysed with this method.
