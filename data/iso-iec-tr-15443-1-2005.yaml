  content: "ISO/IEC TR 15443 is a multi-part type 3 Technical Report to guide the
    IT security professional in the selection of an appropriate assurance method when
    specifying, selecting, or deploying a security service, product, or environmental
    factor such as an organization or personnel (known as a deliverable). The aim
    is to understand the assurance type and amount required to achieve confidence
    that the deliverable satisfies the stated IT security assurance requirements and
    consequently its security policy. \nISO/IEC TR 15443-1:2005 describes the fundamentals
    of security assurance and its relation to other security concepts. This is to
    clarify why security assurance is required and dispel common misconceptions such
    as that increased assurance is gained by increasing the strength of a security
    mechanism. The framework includes a categorization of assurance types and a generic
    lifecycle model to identify the appropriate assurance types required for the deliverable
    with respect to the deliverable's lifecycle. The model also demonstrates how security
    assurance must be managed throughout the deliverable's lifecycle requiring assurance
    decisions to be made by several assurance authorities for the lifecycle stage
    relevant to their organization (i.e. developer, standards, consumer). The framework
    has been developed to be general enough to accommodate different assurance types
    and map into any lifecycle approach so as not to dictate any particular design.
    Advanced security assurance concepts, such as combining security assurance methods,
    are addressed briefly as they are to be addressed in later parts of ISO/IEC TR
    15443.\nISO/IEC TR 15443 targets IT security managers and other security professionals
    responsible for developing a security assurance program, engineering security
    into a deliverable, determining the security assurance of their deliverable, entering
    an assurance assessment audit (e.g. ISO 9000, SSE-CMM (ISO/IEC 21827), ISO/IEC
    15408-3), or other assurance activities."
