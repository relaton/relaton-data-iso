abstract:
- content: "ISO 16484-5:2014 defines data communication services and protocols for
    computer equipment used for monitoring and control of heating, ventilation, air-conditioning
    and refrigeration (HVAC&R) and other building systems. It defines, in addition,
    an abstract, object-oriented representation of information communicated between
    such equipment, thereby facilitating the application and use of digital control
    technology in buildings. \nIt provides a comprehensive set of messages for conveying
    encoded binary, analog, and alphanumeric data between devices including, but not
    limited to, hardware binary input and output values, hardware analog input and
    output values,software binary and analog values, text string values, schedule
    information, alarm and event information, files, and control logic.\nIt models
    each building automation and control computer as a collection of data structures
    called \"objects,\" the properties of which represent various aspects of the hardware,
    software, and operation of the device. These objects provide a means of identifying
    and accessing information without requiring knowledge of the details of the device's
    internal design or configuration."
