    This document provides the basic terms used in manual sampling of coal and coke and describes the general principles of sampling. It provides procedures and requirements for establishing a manual sampling scheme, methods of manual sampling, sampling equipment, handling and storage of samples, sample preparation and a sampling report, and applies to manual sampling during the transfer of coal or coke. Guidelines for manual sampling in stationary situations are given in Annex B, but this method of sampling does not provide a representative test sample and the sampling report shall state this.
    This document covers sampling of brown coals and lignites, but does not include sampling from coal seams, for which guidance is given in ISO 14180. Mechanical sampling of coal and coke is covered in ISO 13909.
