    This document defines requirements and specifications for indoor positioning references, which can be referenced for positioning in indoor space, for supporting indoor navigation functionality of a personal/vehicle (P/V) ITS station.
    This document defines:
    a)    the composition of indoor positioning references for use in obtaining indoor positions for indoor navigation of P/V-ITS-stations;
    b)    the schema and encoding format of indoor positioning references for P/V-ITS-stations.
    This document focuses on indoor positioning references. The following issues which are adjunctive but essential for commercial navigation services are beyond the scope of this document:
    —    authorized and authenticated access of users and services, including security;
    —    payment;
    —    preparation of indoor data which are necessary for indoor navigation;
    —    low-level communication protocols required to transfer and share data from and to a roadside ITS station or a central ITS station;
    —    other issues dependent on implementation of an instance of indoor navigation.
