  content: Defines levels of performance of anodic oxide coatings that have been subjected
    to corrosion tests. The rating system is applicable to pitting corrosion of the
    basis metal resulting from accelerated tests, exposure to corrosive environments
    and practical service tests. It is frequently used for rating the results of short
    term corrosion tests on relatively thin anodic coatings such as those used in
    the automotive industry.
