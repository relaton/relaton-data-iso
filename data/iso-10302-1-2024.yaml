    This document specifies methods for measuring the airborne noise emitted by small air-moving devices (AMDs), such as those used for cooling electronic, electrical, and mechanical equipment where the sound power level of the AMD is of interest.
    Examples of these AMDs include propeller fans, tube-axial fans, vane-axial fans, centrifugal fans, motorized impellers, and their variations.
    This document describes the test apparatus and methods for determining the airborne noise emitted by small AMDs as a function of the volume flow rate and the fan static pressure developed by the AMD on the test apparatus. It is intended for use by AMD manufacturers, by manufacturers who use AMDs for cooling electronic equipment and similar applications, and by testing laboratories. It provides a method for AMD manufacturers, equipment manufacturers and testing laboratories to obtain comparable results. Results of measurements made in accordance with this document are expected to be used for engineering information and performance verification, and the methods can be cited in purchase specifications and contracts between buyers and sellers. The ultimate purpose of the measurements is to provide data to assist the designers of electronic, electrical or mechanical equipment which contains one or more AMDs.
    Based on experimental data, a method is given for calculating the maximum volume flow rate of the scaled plenum up to which this document is applicable.
