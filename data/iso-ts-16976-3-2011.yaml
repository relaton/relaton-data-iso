abstract:
- content: "ISO/TS 16976-3:2011 gives:\n-         a description of the factors contributing
    to the present content of the Earth's atmosphere; \n-        a description of
    the physiology of human respiration; \n-        a survey of the current biomedical
    literature on the effects of carbon dioxide and oxygen on human physiology; \n-
    \       examples of environmental circumstances where the partial pressure of
    oxygen or carbon dioxide can vary from that found at sea level.  \nISO/TS 16976-3:2011
    identifies oxygen and carbon dioxide concentration limit values and the length
    of time within which they would not be expected to impose physiological distress.
    \nTo adequately illustrate the effects on human physiology, ISO/TS 16976-3:2011
    addresses both high altitude exposures where low partial pressures are encountered,
    and underwater diving, which involves conditions with high partial pressures.
    The use of respirators and various work rates during which RPD can be worn are
    also included. "
