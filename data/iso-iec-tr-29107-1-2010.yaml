abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 29107-1:2010(E) specifies the concept for a taxonomy of standards
    and other related specifications applicable to intelligent homes. It is intended
    for the classification of specifications from ISO, IEC, ISO/IEC JTC 1, ITU and
    from organizations with liaison status with any of these. It is intended to the
    various standardisation bodies that are contributing to the intelligent home.
    With the help of the concept described in this report they should be able to classify
    their specifications. This will benefit the standardisation bodies to determine
    if there are overlapping specifications or areas for which specifications are
    missing.
