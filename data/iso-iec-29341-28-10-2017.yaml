- content: "ISO/IEC 29341-28-10:2017 specifies the characteristics of the UPnP networked
    service named ApplicationManagement, version 1. This service definition is compliant
    with UPnP Device Architecture 1.0 [1]. \nThis service type enables to manage applications
    and the communications between applications providing various time-sensitive and
    interactive services including implementation-specific applications among various
    display devices, that is, Screen Devices [3] and Screen Control Points.\nScreen
    Devices shall implement this service [3], but this service is allowed to be implemented
    for any UPnP devices as an add-on service.  "
