abstract:
- content: Specifies the nomenclature appropriate to each part of the machine (in
    English, French and Russian, and the equivalent terms in German, Italian and Swedish)
    and the geometrical tests for these sawing machines, and gives the corresponding
    permissible deviations which apply to machines of general purpose use and normal
    accuracy. It deals only with verification of the accuracy of the machine. It does
    not apply to the testing of the running of the machine nor to its characteristics
    which should generally be checked before the accuracy is tested.
