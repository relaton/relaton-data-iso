- content: |-
    ISO/ASTM 51261 covers the basis for selecting and calibrating dosimetry systems used to measure absorbed doses in gamma-ray or X-ray fields and in electron beams used for radiation processing. It discusses the types of dosimetry systems that may be used during calibration or on a routine basis as part of quality assurance in commercial radiation processing of products. ISO/ASTM 51261 also discusses interpretation of absorbed doses and briefly outlines measurements of the uncertainties associated with the dosimetry. The details of the calibration of the analytical instrumentation are addressed in individual dosimetry system standard practices.
    The absorbed-dose range covered is up to 1 MGy (100 Mrad). Source energies covered are from 0,1 to 50 MeV photons and electrons.
    This International Standard should be used along with standard practices and guides for specific dosimetry systems and applications covered in other standards. It does not cover dosimetry for radiation processing with neutrons or heavy charged particles.
