    ISO 4960:2007 applies to cold-reduced carbon steel strip with a mass fraction of carbon over 0,25 %. It is commonly produced in thicknesses of 6 mm and under, and in widths up to 600 mm exclusive, in coils and cut lengths. The strip is ordered in the as-delivered condition and is predominantly used for springs, but also for other highly stressed parts of many different types. Steel designations CS55 to CS95 may be supplied in the quenched and tempered condition.
    ISO 4960:2007 does not apply to alloy steels or stainless steels.
