abstract:
- content: "This standard addresses the development of the commissioning plan at the
    design stage planning of commissioning activities for new construction projects.
    The commissioning plan incorporates commissioning activities which begin during
    early project stages, and continue through design, construction, project turnover,
    occupancy, and operation. The commissioning plan documents the intended process
    to verify and document that the quality of the built project in operation meets
    the requirements of the owner. Excluded: commissioning in existing buildings.\n\nBackground:\n\nThis
    standard applies to the development of the commissioning plan, the document which
    includes procedures, methods and documentation requirements that apply to the
    commissioning process for the building systems at each phase of the project, from
    pre-design through occupancy and operation. The building commissioning plan can
    be developed for individual, multiple or the whole building systems and assemblies.
    This standard applies to new building construction projects.\nThe commissioning
    plan is used by the owner, commissioning provider, building developer, owner’s
    representative, construction manager, architect, contractor, sub-contractors and
    / or other consultants to determine the tasks and activities required to commission
    the project in accordance with the project requirements of the owner. \nCommissioning
    providers use this standard to develop a project specific commissioning plan,
    which includes the list of systems to be commissioned, the scope of tasks associated
    with the process to achieve the owner’s specific commissioning requirements, and
    the work plan to accomplish those tasks. Requirements for the project are established
    by the owner and/or commissioning provider. This standard indicates the minimum
    set of definitions of commissioning that can be commonly applied. \nThe ISO time
    limits will not allow completion of work on the existing work item. The new work
    item is intended to incorporate the work to date on the existing work item, and
    available commissioning standards including USA’s ASHRAE Standard 202-2018, Canada’s
    Z5000-18, and Mexico’s NMX-C-506. Commissioning is closely related to – and must
    be tailored to suit – the building design and construction process for each project.
    As these processes differ in each country, specific commissioning planning methods
    shall be determined by the national standards or documents of each country."
