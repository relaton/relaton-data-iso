abstract:
- content: "This document specifies requirements and test methods for pipes and fittings
    which are part of piping systems for the rehabilitation by means of renovation
    and trenchless replacement of underground gas supply networks.\nIt is applicable
    to polyethylene (PE) pipes, fittings and assemblies, as manufactured and as installed.
    It is not applicable to the existing pipeline.\n\nIt is applicable to technique
    families for renovation:\n— lining with continuous pipes;\n— lining with close-fit
    pipes;\nand technique families for trenchless replacement:\n— pipe bursting and
    pipe extraction; \n— horizontal directional drilling and impact moling.\n\nThis
    document is applicable to:\n— PE solid wall single layered pipes (nominal outside
    diameter, dn), including any identification stripes;\n— PE pipes with co-extruded
    layers on either or both the outside and inside of the pipe (total outside diameter,
    dn), as specified in Annex D, where all layers have the same MRS rating.\n\nFurthermore,
    when used with lining with continuous pipes and trenchless replacement this document
    is applicable to:\n— PE coated pipes (outside diameter, dn) having a peelable,
    contiguous, thermoplastics additional layer on the outside of the pipe (“coated
    pipe”), as specified in Annex D.\n\nWhen used with lining with close-fit lining
    pipes, the lining pipe is reduced in the factory or on site to provide a close-fitting
    independent or interactive pressure pipe liner.\n\nThis document is applicable
    to jointing by means of butt fusion and electrofusion and to fabricated and injection-moulded
    fittings and mechanical connections of PE.\n\nThis document is not applicable
    to push-fit jointed discrete pipes assembled as part of the trenchless installation
    process."
