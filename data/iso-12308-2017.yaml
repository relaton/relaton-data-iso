    ISO 12308:2017 defines the types of plain bearing samples exchanged between purchaser and manufacturer.
    In the field of internal combustion engines and other series production, it is necessary to work with different types of samples depending on the purpose.
    Types of samples are as follows.
    -      Samples used for tests and examinations which are carried out in the experimental stage and pilot lot stage. These include fitting samples, prototype samples and intermediate samples.
    -      Samples used to prove that the quality is in accordance with the quality requirements (dimensions, material and performance specification). These include initial samples and reference samples and, if necessary, intermediate samples.
    NOTE       See ISO 3534 (all parts) and ISO 9000 for further information.
    -      Samples which give selective information about particular quality characteristics of a plain bearing, relating to their conformity with the specifications. These involve reference and characteristic modification samples.
