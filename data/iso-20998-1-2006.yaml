abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: ISO 20998-1:2006 describes ultrasonic methods for determining the size
    distributions of one or more material phases dispersed in a liquid. Colloids,
    dispersions, slurries and emulsions are within the scope of ISO 20998-1:2006.
    The typical particle size for such analysis ranges from 10 nm to 3 mm, although
    particles outside this range have also been successfully measured. Measurements
    can be made for concentrations of the dispersed phase ranging from 0,1 % by volume
    up to 50 % or more by volume, depending on the density contrast between the continuous
    and the dispersed phases. These methods can be used to monitor dynamic changes
    in the size distribution, including agglomeration or flocculation in concentrated
    systems.
