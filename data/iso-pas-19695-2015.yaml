    ISO/PAS 19695:2015 is intended to be applied to safety-related systems that include one or more electrical and/or electronic (E/E) systems and that are installed in series production two-wheeled or three-wheeled motorcycles.
    ISO/PAS 19695:2015 Standard does not address unique E/E systems in special purpose vehicles, such as vehicles designed for competition.
    ISO/PAS 19695:2015 Standard addresses possible hazards caused by malfunctioning behaviour of E/E safety-related systems, including interaction of these systems. It does not address hazards related to electric shock, fire, smoke, heat, radiation, toxicity, flammability, reactivity, corrosion, release of energy, and similar hazards, unless directly caused by malfunctioning behaviour of E/E safety-related systems.
    ISO/PAS 19695:2015 Standard does not address the nominal performance of E/E systems, even if dedicated functional performance standards exist for these systems.
