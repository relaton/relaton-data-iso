abstract:
- content: This document specifies the air interface, including the cognitive radio
    medium access control layer (MAC) and physical layer (PHY), of point-to-multipoint
    and backhaul wireless regional area networks (WRANs) comprised of a professional
    fixed base station (BS) with fixed and portable user terminals. The document specifies
    operation in the bands that allow spectrum sharing where the communications devices
    may opportunistically operate in the spectrum of the primary service, such as
    the VHF/UHF TV broadcast bands between 54 MHz to 862 MHz, and the 1300 MHz to
    1750 MHz and 2700 MHz to 3700 MHz bands provided the regulatory regime allows
    it.
