    This document gives guidelines for the application of principles and a process for a complexity assessment of an organization's systems to improve security and resilience. A complexity assessment process allows an organization to identify potential hidden vulnerabilities of its system and to provide an early indication of risk resulting from complexity.
    This document is generic and applicable to all sizes and types of organization systems, such as critical assets, strategic networks, supply chains, industrial plants, community infrastructures, banks and business companies.
