    ISO 26430-5:2009 specifies a Security Event Class and namespace for Security Log Records. It also constrains individual Log Records and sequences of such records (Log Reports) as they are used for security event logging purposes in D-cinema applications. The items covered contain descriptions of events logged by the security system, which are intended to provide forensic information regarding security critical events.
    ISO 26430-5:2009 does not specify the means of communication or the format of messaging between security devices in a system, nor does it define the format for storage of Log Events within the protected storage of a security device. The Security Log Records and Security Log Record Sequences (Log Reports) described herein are intended for the reporting of Security Events previously recorded by the security system to consumers of that information which are external to the security system.
