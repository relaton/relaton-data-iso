    ISO 8873-1:2006 specifies minimum requirements and test methods for spray-applied polyurethane rigid cellular plastic, used as a thermal insulation for both building, whether applied on a building site or in a prefabrication (manufacturing) facility, and non-building applications. The material is also known as in-situ thermal insulation.
    The spray-applied polyurethane rigid cellular plastic thermal insulation is not to be used when the continuous service temperature of the substrate is outside the range of -60 째C to +80 째C.
    The test methods used to determine the material properties provide a means of comparing different cellular plastic thermal insulations. They are intended for use in specifications, product evaluations and quality control. They are not intended to predict end-use product performance.
