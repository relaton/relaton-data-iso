    ISO/PAS 19295:2016 provides specification of voltage sub-classes for electric propulsion systems and conductively connected auxiliary electric systems of electrically propelled road vehicles.
    The voltage sub-classes are related to d.c. electric circuits.
    It applies only to electric circuits and components with maximum working voltages according to voltage class B.
    ISO/PAS 19295:2016 provides specifications of characteristics which are relevant for design and operation of components and systems for the standardized voltage sub-classes.
    It enables vehicle manufacturers and supply industry to evaluate the characteristics of components or systems for their specific vehicle applications.
