    This part of ISO 18312 specifies a method for evaluating the vibration power emitted by machines or pipelines
    (referred to hereinafter as machines) on to supporting structures to which the machines are connected
    through vibration isolators. This part of ISO 18312 also specifies the method for evaluating the vibration power
    components emitted in the six degrees of freedom of a Cartesian coordinate system at each joint, i.e. three
    translations and three rotations. The vibration power is determined by processing the signals from two sets
    of velocity (or acceleration) transducers mounted at the isolator connection points, one set on the machine
    side (input) and the other on the foundation side (output). This method is applicable for machines under the
    assumption that their vibration can be characterized by a stationary random process.
    The components of emitted vibration power are computed using the cross-spectra of the two sets of velocity in
    narrow band (or one third-octave) and the dynamic stiffness characteristics of the isolator over the frequency
    range of interest.
    The upper frequency limits of this method are established in this part of ISO 18312.
    This part of ISO 18312 can be used for:
    a) evaluating a machinery system from isolator design concept;
    b) obtaining data for preparation of technical requirements for allowable machine vibration power emission;
    c) determining appropriate and cost-effective vibration control procedures;
    d) solving diagnostics issues.
