abstract:
- content: "ISO 4669 Document Management — Information specifies basic concepts and
    organizational needs to handle sensitive data. \nThis second part would be complementary
    and defines functional and technical specifications of solutions addressing these
    needs.\nThis document addresses solutions which manage and distribute content
    in digital format only, both inside and outside the organization owning the content.\nTwo
    types of solutions will be covered: distribution of digital content to identified
    recipients, and distribution of credentials to access content stored on secured
    centralized systems. The distribution of content by means of physical media is
    excluded from the scope of the proposal (printed materials, hard copy, storage
    media…)\n \nProposed outline (detailed in annex A):\n1-Setting the context for
    the ICMH system\n2-Content preparation (Information Assets)\n3-Distribution –
    sharing\n4-Rendering: operation on the workstation of authorized recipients\n5-Traceability"
