    This document provides specifications for intelligent transport systems (ITS) station management to conform with the ITS station reference architecture.
    Remote ITS station management is specified by means of protocol data units (PDUs) and procedures of the "Remote ITS Station Management Protocol" (RSMP) related to managed objects in an ITS station communication unit. Distinction is made between managed entities (management clients) and managing entities (management servers).
