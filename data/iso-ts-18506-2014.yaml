    ISO/TS 18506:2014 provides a procedure to develop injury risk curves for biomechanical samples. These samples are often heavily censored and limited in size, such that specific steps and checks are required when developing injury risk curves. Moreover, several statistical methods were historically used to build injury risk curves. The curves resulting from the different methods could be rather close or fairly different, depending on the biomechanical samples. It is therefore of major importance to recommend a consensual method to be used. Otherwise, injury thresholds candidates to be included into regulations could be highly influenced by the statistical method used. These different methods were compared in a statistical simulation study. The conclusions of this study were used to recommend the survival analysis.
    ISO/TS 18506:2014 identifies steps to be followed to develop injury risk curves. It recommends preliminary checks, statistical method, and recommendation process of the injury risk curve. Guidelines on the type of the samples to be used (cadaver, animal, or dummy), as well as the variables to be used, and the injury severity level are beyond the scope of ISO/TS 18506:2014.
