    This document describes currently available pre-crash classifications that specify theconflict situation between road traffic actors that leads to a crash. This documentdescribes classifications that are based on different real-world crash data types andcollection origins. The focus is on the assessment of attributes and characteristics ofdifferent approaches and their applicability to data-driven traffic safety research.This document provides considerations for choosing an appropriate pre-crash situationclassification to address the traffic safety research questions that require analysis ofreal-world crash data.
    This document does not address test scenarios that describe the operation domain ofassisted or automated driving systems.
