    ISO 44001:2017 specifies requirements for the effective identification, development and management of collaborative business relationships within or between organizations.
    ISO 44001:2017 is applicable to private and public organizations of all sizes, from large multinational corporations and government organizations, to non-profit organizations and micro/small businesses.
    Application of ISO 44001:2017 can be on several different levels, e.g.
    ·         a single application (including operating unit, operating division, single project or programme, mergers and acquisitions);
    ·         an individual relationship (including one-to-one relationships, alliance, partnership, business customers, joint venture);
    ·         multiple identified relationships (including multiple partner alliances, consortia, joint ventures, networks, extended enterprise arrangements and end-to-end supply chains);
    ·         full application organization-wide for all identified relationship types.
