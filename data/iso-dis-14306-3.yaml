  content: "The JT file format specification for 3D visualization specifies the sequential
    order of bytes that comprise the segments of data required to represent an ISO
    14306 file. The JT format is uniquely compressed to minimize file size. \nThe
    JT file format specification for 3D visualization includes data descriptions that
    can represent the following data.\n—  facet information (triangles), stored with
    geometry compression techniques; \n—  visual attributes such as lights, textures
    and materials; \n—  product manufacturing information (PMI); \n—  boundary representation
    (b-rep) solid model shape representation and associated metadata; \n—  configuration
    representations; and\n—  delivery methods such as asynchronous streaming of content.\n\nThe
    JT file format specification for 3D visualization does not specify the implementation
    of, or definition of, any runtime architecture for viewing and/or processing ISO
    14306 data."
