    This document, within the context of methods and tools for product line product management:
    —          defines product line-specific processes and their subprocesses for product management of software and systems product lines. Those processes are described in terms of purpose, inputs, tasks and outcomes;
    —          defines method capabilities to support the defined tasks of each process;
    —          defines tool capabilities to automate/semi-automate tasks or defined method capabilities.
    This document does not concern processes and capabilities of tools and methods for a single system but rather deals with those for a family of products.
