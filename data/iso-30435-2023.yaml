abstract:
- content: "This document provides the basis for organizational improvement underpinned
    by quality workforce data that supports analysis and evidenced-based decision-making.\nWorkforce
    data quality, for the purpose of this document, is the process of:\na)       workforce
    data determination;\nb)       data capture;\nc)        data maintenance; \nd)      
    data review processes.\nThe focus of this document is on the quality of data itself
    rather than on other critical aspects relating to the overall management of data,
    such as privacy and security of personal data, the analysis and reporting of data
    and the use of technology.\nThis document does not cover the analysis of data
    and reporting structure or the definition of any metric other than quality of
    workforce data. Technology platforms in the form of human resource information
    systems, databases, spreadsheets, and the like, can improve the process of the
    capture and management of data. The focus of this document is the data itself.\nWhile
    data security and data privacy are also critical to the overall management of
    data, they are not dealt with in this document.\nThis document is applicable to
    all types and sizes of organization across all industry sectors and regions."
