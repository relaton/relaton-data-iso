  content: "ISO/TS 15638-6:2013 specifies the common roles and responsibilities of
    actors providing regulated application (4.47) systems which use TARV to provide
    regulated application services (4.48) for regulated commercial freight vehicles
    (4.49), and the interoperability of key operational steps and actions required
    to support all TARV regulated application service (4.48) systems. \nISO/TS 15638-6:2013
    specifies the general conditions for data exchanges between an application service
    provider (4.7) and vehicle IVS (4.32), and from other ITS-stations (4.34) to the
    IVS of the regulated commercial freight vehicle (4.49), and specifies generic
    data concepts for identified services, but it does not define the detailed aspects
    of the application services (4.6) or their implementation, application specific
    aspects being defined in defined in ISO 15638-8 et sequential for each identified
    application service.\nISO/TS 15638-6:2013  addresses the general and common requirements
    for the provision of regulated application services (4.48) that require data in
    addition to, or instead of, basic vehicle data (4.16) and core application data
    (4.23) (application specific aspects being defined in defined in ISO 15638-8 et
    sequential for each identified application service).\nISO/TS 15638-6:2013 provides
    common aspects of specifications (4.55) for communications and data exchange aspects
    of identified application services (4.6) (as defined in defined in ISO 15638-8
    et sequentia) that a regulator (4.50) may elect to require or support as an option,
    including:\na)     high level definition of the service that a service provider
    (4.53) has to provide, (The service definition describes common service elements;
    but does not define the detail of how such an application service (4.6) is instantiated,
    not the acceptable value ranges of the data concepts defined)\nb)     means to
    realise the service\nc)     application data common to all parts as defined in
    defined in ISO 15638-8 et sequentia, naming content and quality that an IVS (4.32)
    has to deliver.\nThe definition of what comprises a ?regulated' service is regarded
    as an issue for national decision, and may vary from jurisdiction (4.38) to jurisdiction.
    This document does not impose any requirements on nations in respect of which
    services for regulated commercial freight vehicles jurisdictions will require,
    or support as an option, but provides standardised sets of requirements descriptions
    for identified services to enable consistent and cost efficient implementations
    where instantiated.\nISO 15638 has been developed for use in the context of regulated
    commercial freight vehicles [hereinafter referred to as ?regulated vehicles' (4.49)].
    There is nothing, however, to prevent a jurisdiction extending or adapting the
    scope to include other types of regulated vehicles, as it deems appropriate."
