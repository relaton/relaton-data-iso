    This document describes a test method for the flexural strength of monolithic ceramic thin plates at room temperature by three-point bending or four-point bending.
    This document is intended for use with monolithic ceramics and whisker- or particulate-reinforced ceramics which are regarded as macroscopically homogeneous. It does not include continuous-fibre-reinforced ceramics composites. This document is applicable to ceramic thin plates with a thickness from 0,2 mm to 1,0 mm.
    This document is for material development, material comparison, quality assurance, characterization and reliability data generation.
