abstract:
- content: ISO 23868:2008 specifies test methods to determine the quality of data
    on recorded media and provides specifications enabling end-user organizations
    to monitor data quality and ongoing conformance with the error limits required
    for its class identified by the manufacturer of the drive/media. ISO 23868:2008
    defines error rate monitoring capabilities and procedures associated with 130
    mm optical media while being used in a production environment to ensure that data
    is still readable throughout the expected life of the media.
