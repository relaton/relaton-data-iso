  content: "ISO/IEC 24775-4:2014(E) defines an interface for the secure, extensible,
    and interoperable management of a distributed and heterogeneous storage system.
    This interface uses an object-oriented, XML-based, messaging-based protocol designed
    to support the specific requirements of managing devices and subsystems in this
    storage environment. Using this protocol, this International Standard describes
    the information available to a WBEM Client from an Information technology - Storage
    management compliant CIM WBEM   \nServer. This International Standard, together
    with ISO/IEC 24775-1 to ISO/IEC 24775-3 and ISO/IEC 24775-5 to ISO/IEC 24775-8,
    replaces ISO/IEC 24775, second edition, published in 2011, and constitutes a technical
    revision. This edition includes the following significant technical changes with
    respect to the previous edition:      \n- reorganization into eight parts;                           \n-
    maturity identification using stages;                      \n- and new profiles."
