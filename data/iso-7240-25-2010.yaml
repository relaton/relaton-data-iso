  content: |-
    ISO 7240-25:2010 specifies requirements, test methods and performance criteria for components used in fire detection and alarm systems, installed in and around buildings, which use radio-frequency (r.f.) transmission paths. It specifies requirements for the assessment of conformance of the components to the requirements of ISO 7240-25:2010.
    Where components work together and this requires knowledge of the system design, ISO 7240-25:2010 also specifies requirements for the system.
    When the fire detection and alarm system uses wired and r.f. transmission paths, the relevant parts of ISO 7240 apply together with ISO 7240-25:2010. Requirements relevant to wire transmission paths are superseded or modified by those included in ISO 7240-25:2010.
    ISO 7240-25:2010 does not restrict the intended use of radio spectrum, e.g. frequency, power output of devices; the allowed maximum number of the components using r.f. transmission paths within the fire detection and alarm system or one wire transmission path and/or r.f. transmission path; or the allowed maximum number of the components affected by loss of one wire transmission path and/or r.f. transmission path.
