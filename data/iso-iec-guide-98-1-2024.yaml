abstract:
- content: This document establishes general rules for evaluating and expressing uncertainty
    in measurement from the shop floor to fundamental research. Therefore, the principles
    of this suite of documents are intended to be applicable to a broad spectrum of
    measurements and their applications. An overview of the parts of the GUM is given
    in table A.1 in Annex A. NOTE Where the acronym GUM is used in this document,
    it refers to the suite of documents. An individual part of the GUM is referred
    to by its corresponding JCGM numbering (e.g., part 6 of the GUM is JCGM GUM-6:2020).
    This document gives a rationale for evaluating, expressing and using measurement
    uncertainty (Clause 2). A brief introduction is given to measurement (Clause 3)
    and to the decisions involved when evaluating measurement uncertainty (Clause
    4). In Clause 5, a brief description of the contents of the parts of the GUM is
    given. In each of these clauses, the relevant parts of the GUM are identified
    for further guidance.
