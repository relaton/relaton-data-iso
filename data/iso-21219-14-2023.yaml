    This document specifies the TPEG parking information (PKI) application which has been designed to deliver parking information to a variety of receivers using a number of different channels, particularly digital broadcasting and internet technologies. Parking information can be presented to the user in many different ways, including text, voice or graphics.
    Today, traffic congestion has become a serious problem in urban areas. Some traffic congestion is attributed to drivers searching for parking spaces. Timely provision of parking information can help to ease traffic congestion. Furthermore, parking information is valuable for visitors, particularly when it can be used to signal where a temporary parking facility is established for a special event.
