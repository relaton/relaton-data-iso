  content: "ISO 15928-3:2009 sets out a method for describing the structural durability
    performance of houses. It covers the needs of the user, provides performance descriptions,
    establishes parameter descriptions and outlines evaluation processes.\nIt is intended
    for use in the evaluation of the design and construction of houses, in the international
    trading of houses or their subsystems and in developing quality systems for houses.
    \nISO 15928-3:2009 does not apply to structural safety, serviceability and other
    attributes, which are covered in other parts of ISO 15928."
