  content: ISO/TS 17187:2013 provides governance rules to be used for executing an
    organized process for business entities to connect to one another electronically
    for the conduct of electronic trade in a secure and open environment through a
    standardized framework for information exchange. This standardized framework includes
    the processes and process tools that will ease connections between trading partners,
    provide full visibility, and reduce the time goods spend in transit. Additionally,
    the application of these rules and attendant standards and technology applications
    are expected to allow business entities to engage their legacy systems without
    the cost of upgrades.
