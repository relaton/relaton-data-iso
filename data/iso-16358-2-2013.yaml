abstract:
- content: |-
    ISO 16358-2:2013 specifies the testing and calculating methods for seasonal performance factor of equipment covered by ISO 5151, ISO 13253 and ISO 15042. For the purposes of ISO 16358-2:2013, it is assumed that any make-up heating will be provided by electric heaters running concurrently with the heat pump.
    ISO 16358-2:2013 also specifies the seasonal performance test conditions and the corresponding test procedures for determining the seasonal performance factor of equipment, as specified above, under mandatory test conditions and is intended for use only in marking, comparison, and certification purposes.
    ISO 16358-2:2013 does not apply to the testing and rating of:
    - water-source heat pumps or water-cooled air conditioners;
    - portable units having a condenser exhaust duct;
    - individual assemblies not constituting a complete refrigeration system; or
    - equipment using the absorption refrigeration cycle.
