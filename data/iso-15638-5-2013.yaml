  content: "ISO 15638-5:2013 defines generic basic vehicle and core application data
    provision to application service providers to be supported by in-vehicle systems
    (IVS) for cooperative telematics applications for regulated commercial freight
    vehicles (TARV), and to provide basic vehicle data for cooperative intelligent
    transport systems.\nISO 15638-5:2013 provides the specifications for generic basic
    vehicle data that it is required for all TARV IVSs to support and make available
    to application service providers via a wireless communications link supported
    by the IVS, in order to support the provision of regulated and commercial application
    services.\nSome further data concepts, while not required in all cases for every
    TARV in every jurisdiction, may be required generically for all equipment within
    a particular jurisdiction, or class of TARV within a jurisdiction, in order for
    the jurisdiction to achieve its regulation of TARVs. \nEquipped vehicles operating
    internationally will need to carry all of the additional data concepts required
    by all of the jurisdictions within which they operate, in order to determine their
    core application data. ISO 15638-5:2013 provides standard definitions for these
    commonly expected additional data concepts.\nA second set of (largely complementary)
    'basic vehicle' data is required to support interoperable cooperative intelligent
    transport systems and this is also determined and provided within ISO 15638-5:2013.
    The framework architecture and many of the protocols are common between both (TARV
    and C-ITS) sets of requirements, and also with those being adopted by the wider
    cooperative ITS sector."
