- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: ISO 14701:2011 specifies several methods for measuring the oxide thickness
    at the surfaces of (100) and (111) silicon wafers as an equivalent thickness of
    silicon dioxide when measured using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. It is only
    applicable to flat, polished specimens and for instruments that incorporate an
    Al or Mg X-ray source, a specimen stage that permits defined photoelectron emission
    angles and a spectrometer with an input lens that can be restricted to less than
    a 6° cone semi-angle. For thermal oxides in the range 1 nm to 8 nm thickness,
    using the best method described in the standard, uncertainties, at a 95 % confidence
    level, could typically be around 2 % and around 1 % at optimum. A simpler method
    is also given with slightly poorer, but often adequate, uncertainties.
