abstract:
- content: Relates to the analysis of a possible excess of acidity or alkalinity.
    Detection by dissolution of a test portion in water. Addition of a known excess
    of standard volumetric suphuric acid solution in the presence of methyl red. Elimination
    of the carbon dioxide by boiling. Titration of the excess of acid with standard
    volumetric sodium hydroxide solution. Calculation expressed as sulphuric acid
    or sodium carbonate depending on whether the quantity of acid found is higher
    or less than the known quantity introduced.
