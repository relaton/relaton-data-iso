abstract:
- content: "This document describes a basic role and functional model for mobility
    services using low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite systems for ITS services. This
    document provides:\na)       a role and functional model using a LEO satellite
    system for mobility services;\nb)       a description of the concept of operations
    (CONOPS), and the relevant role models;\nc)        a conceptual architecture between
    actors involved;\nd)       references for the key documents on which the architecture
    is based;\ne)       a mobility service use case summary.\nIn-vehicle control systems
    are not within the scope of this document. \nThis document scope is limited to
    mobility services using physical and digital infrastructure.\nNOTE          Physical
    infrastructure facilities include for example, battery charging facilities, dynamic
    charging facilities for battery electric vehicles, physical infrastructure markings,
    physical traffic regulation signs, mobility monitoring facilities, emergency response
    service support facilities, traffic operation control centre facilities, fee collection
    service facilities (e.g. road usage fee), battery electric vehicle  charging facilities,
    online reservation and online mobility usage fee payment facilities, and other
    infrastructure platform facilities that support ITS mobility services. "
