    ISO/ASTM 51538 covers the preparation, handling, testing and procedure for using the ethanol-chlorobenzene dosimetry system to measure absorbed doses in materials irradiated by photons and electrons in terms of absorbed dose in water. The system consists of a dosimeter and appropriate analytical instrumentation. This practice describes the titration analysis as a standard readout procedure for the ECB dosimeter and applies only to gamma rays, X rays and high-energy electrons.
    This practice applies provided the following are satis-fied:
    the absorbed dose range is from 10 Gy to 2 MGy;
    the absorbed dose rate does not exceed 106 Gy s -1;
    for radionuclide gamma-ray sources, the initial photon energy is greater than 0,6 MeV;
    for bremsstrahlung photons, the initial energy of the electrons used to produce the bremsstrahlung photons is equal to or greater than 2 MeV;
    for electron beams, the initial electron energy is equal to or greater than 4 MeV.
    the irradiation temperature of the dosimeter is within the range from - 40 °C to 80°C;
    the effects of size and shape of the irradiation vessel on the response of the dosimeter can adequately be taken into account by performing the appropriate calculations using cavity theory.
