abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 15504 provides a framework for the assessment of processes. This
    framework can be used by organizations involved in planning, managing, monitoring,
    controlling, and improving the acquisition, supply, development, operation, evolution
    and support of product and services.\nThe published ISO/IEC 15504 process assessment
    models for systems and software do not currently provide a sufficient basis for
    performing a process capability assessment of processes with respect to the development
    of complex safety-related systems. \nDeveloping safety-related systems requires
    specialized processes, techniques, skills and experience. Process amplifications
    (safety extension) are needed in the area of safety management, safety engineering
    and safety qualification. ISO/IEC TS 15504-10:2011 presents these amplifications
    (a safety extension) as three process descriptions: safety management, safety
    engineering and safety certification processes.\nThe aim of ISO/IEC TS 15504-10:2011
    is not to provide a way to verify the compliance with one or more domain-specific
    safety standards, nor to extend ISO/IEC 15504 in order to use it as a safety standard
    against which to verify compliance. The aim is to provide assessors with the necessary
    means and information for measuring the capability of processes and also defining
    possible process improvement actions when the software/system under development
    is safety-related.\nISO/IEC TS 15504-10:2011, as a standalone document, can be
    used in conjunction with ISO/IEC 15504-5 and/or ISO/IEC TR 15504-6 process assessment
    models by experienced assessors with minimal support from safety domain experts.
    \nISO/IEC TS 15504-10:2011 is developed independent of any specific safety standards
    that define safety principles, methods, techniques and work products. However,
    elements of relevant safety standards are able to be mapped to the safety extension
    and the safety extension is intended to be extendable to include specific safety
    standards requirements.\nThe influence of the safety extension on the assessment
    of the processes in ISO/IEC 15504-5 and ISO/IEC TR 15504-6 is described in ISO/IEC
    TS 15504-10:2011. For each process contained in ISO/IEC 15504-5 and ISO/IEC TR
    15504-6, there is an indication of additional issues to be taken into account
    at assessment time. The issues are provided by means of sentences indicating specific
    relationships between ISO/IEC 15504-5 and ISO/IEC TR 15504-6 processes and the
    ISO/IEC TS 15504-10:2011 processes as well as highlighting relevant aspects to
    be considered to improve the completeness of the data-gathering phase of the assessment.
    In this way, an assessor can use ISO/IEC TS 15504-10:2011 to check whether, in
    assessing an ISO/IEC 15504-5 or ISO/IEC TR 15504-6 process, some relevant aspects
    related to the safety development environment have been missed."
