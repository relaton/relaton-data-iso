- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "This document describes the methodology for the sampling of suspended
    microplastic particles in water (drinking water, surface waters, freshwater, seawater,
    wastewater-treated effluents, and untreated wastewater), for their subsequent
    characterisation which may include particle count, sizing, polymer identification
    and other physical or chemical analyses (including, for example, analysis via
    Pyrolysis gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS), IR spectroscopy, or
    Raman spectroscopy, and their corresponding sample preparation). \n\nFor drinking
    water and water samples with low, medium and high-suspended solids, this document
    covers sampling using a set of subsequent stainless-steel filters of different
    pore sizes. For sampling in lakes, rivers, marine surface and near-surface waters
    the document will describe the use of manta trawls, Neuston nets and Plankton
    nets; and the sampling of groundwater and freshwater sediments via cylinder resuspension,
    benthic samplers, and groundwater monitoring systems."
