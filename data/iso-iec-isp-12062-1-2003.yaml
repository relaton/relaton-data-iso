  content: |-
    ISO/IEC ISP 12062-1:2003(E) contains the overall specifications of the support of MHS Elements of Service and associated MHS functionality in an Interpersonal Messaging (IPM) environment which are generally not appropriate for consideration only from the perspective of a single MHS protocol. These specifications form part of the Interpersonal Messaging application functions, as defined in ISO/IEC ISP 12062 (all parts), and are based on the Common Messaging content type-independent specifications in ISO/IEC ISP 10611. Such specifications are in many cases applicable to more than one MHS protocol or are otherwise concerned with component functionality which, although it can be verified via protocol, is not just related to protocol support. They are therefore designed to be referenced in the MHS Interpersonal Messaging application profiles ISO/IEC ISP 12062-2 (AMH21), ISO/IEC ISP 12062-3 (AMH22), ISO/IEC ISP 12062-4 (AMH23 and AMH25), ISO/IEC ISP 12062-5 (AMH24) and ISO/IEC ISP 12062-6 (AMH26), which specify the support of specific MHS protocols and associated functionality.
    The specifications in ISO/IEC ISP 12062-1:2003(E) are divided into basic requirements, which are required to be supported by all IPM MHS implementations, and a number of optional functional groups, which cover significant discrete areas of related functionality which are not required to be supported by all implementations.
    An overview of the scope and applicability of the AMH2n set of profiles and of the structure of this multipart ISP is provided in Annex D.
