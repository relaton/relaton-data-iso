    This document provides installation specifications for ship communication networks, so as to improve communication between shipboard equipment and within shipboard systems that are independent from navigational equipment networks and engine-control networks. This document can also be applied to operational technology (OT) networks that use software and hardware to control and monitor devices and infrastructure such as navigational equipment networks and machinery control networks in ship.
    The ship communication networks covered in this document are intended for information sharing and are not directly related to safety of navigation.
    This document utilizes existing standards relating to protocols, and provides new specifications for aspects such as communication network-system architecture, administration, operation and installation.
    The new specifications in this document include: redundancy, if necessary, for a shipboard communication network system; a network administration that does not require experts; physical as well as logical security; and network installation.
    This document uses the standard communication network Internet protocol.
    This document applies to shipboard wired networks for IP communication, using Fast Ethernet and Gigabit Ethernet as specified in IEEE 802.3 and to shipboard wireless networks for IP communication, using the unlicensed 2,4 GHz and 5 GHz bands as specified in IEEE 802.11.
    NOTE          Other wireless technologies based on non-IP communication such as IEEE 802.15.1, IEEE 802.15.4 or wireless communication methods using 920 MHz band are not covered in this document.
