    ISO/IEC 18036:2003 defines a consistent set of icons and related functions that are represented by World Wide Web browser applications on a computer screen and that users interact with to control such applications. The toolbar icons typically represent actions by association with objects in the real world and conventional controls on hardware, and that prompt the user to recall the intended actions.
    ISO/IEC 18036:2003 provides a consistent set of icons applying to such functions as: Back, Forward, Refresh, Home, Search, Print and Stop.
    Each icon in ISO/IEC 18036:2003 is specified with the following:
    - Primary function;
    - Specific instance;
    - Components;
    - Graphic.
    Web browser toolbar icons enable users to invoke functions that act upon pre-selected or default objects. Functions initiated by these icons may also be available via text commands on menus. Web browser toolbar icons provide direct access to functions by graphically representing those text commands.
