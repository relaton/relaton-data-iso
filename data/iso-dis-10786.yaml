    ISO 10786:2011 establishes requirements for the design; material selection and characterization; fabrication; testing and inspection of all structural items in space systems, including expendable and reusable launch vehicles, satellites and their payloads. When implemented for a particular space system, it will assure high confidence in achieving safe and reliable operation in all phases of its planned mission.
    ISO 10786:2011 applies specifically to all structural items, including fracture-critical hardware used in space systems during all phases of the mission, with the following exceptions: adaptive structures, engines and thermal protection systems.
