    This document is intended to be applied to safety-related systems that include one or more electrical and/or electronic (E/E) systems and that are installed in series production motorcycles. This document does not address unique E/E systems in special vehicles such as E/E systems designed for drivers with disabilities.
    NOTE            The series production motorcycle is the vehicle that is intended to be used for public roads and is not a prototype.
    This document covers HARA for one or more E/E systems installed in motorcycles. The approach of HARA defined in ISO 26262-12:2018, Clause 8 is applied to them in a motorcycle environment.
    The intended user of this document is a functional-safety analyst complying with requirements in ISO 26262-12:2018. Therefore, this document does not intend to provide further necessary knowledge or guidelines in related fields including, but not limited to, item-specific knowledge, user and road profiling, medicine, statistics, accident research and human factors. Instead, it is intended to be related to the field of functional safety with the focus on the HARA examples only. It is the responsibility of the functional-safety analyst to achieve detailed knowledge about the item under investigation and the target application environment.
    In this document, the values shown are for reference only. Any new HARA can use the latest relevant data and analyses. The values shown in this document were derived based on some, but not all segments of information expected within an item description, and thus are not considered as an item definition. The ISO 26262 series requires that a HARA be based on a specific item definition. This document is not to be constructed to suggest that conducting a HARA without a specific item definition is acceptable. The scope of the ISO 26262 series is limited to functional safety which is one aspect of the overall system safety assessment in safety risk management.
    As for any risk assessment method, the methods mentioned in this document have inherent limitations. The HARA describes a simplified model of the real world, which is neither complete nor fully accurate. Although each assessment is based on available or applicable data as well as on expert judgment, the interpretation of such data can vary among analyses. For these reasons, the user of this document can bear in mind these limitations and judge the applicability of this document in any particular case.
