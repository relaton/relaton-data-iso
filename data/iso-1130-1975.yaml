abstract:
- content: Applicable for textile materials in all forms. No single technique of sampling
    can be devised that will serve in all circumstances. General terms and their definitions
    are given. A lot of different sampling methods are described (e.g. for bast fibres,
    cotton fibres, man-made staple fibres, and wool fibres). The determination of
    the number of individuals to be tested in dependence on the variability of the
    material and the accuracy required is given in the annex.
