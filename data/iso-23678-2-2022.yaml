    This document establishes a uniform, safe and consistent approach to training and assessment of personnel to enable them to establish and maintain the required competencies in relation to maintenance, thorough examination, operational testing, overhaul and repair of lifeboats, rescue boats, launching appliances and release gear.
    It also provides the necessary information for interested parties to grant authorization and effectively evaluate and audit training, supporting the IMO Requirements, section 3.
    It specifies the initial training programme for personnel certified by a manufacturer or by an authorized service provider to carry out maintenance, thorough examination, operational testing, overhaul and repair of lifeboats (including free-fall lifeboats) and rescue boats (including fast rescue boats), launching appliances and release gear. This document specifies the training requirements for initial service technician training only.
    This document is intended to be used in conjunction with ISO 23678-1, ISO 23678-3 and ISO 23678-4.
    This document is applicable to the following types of lifeboats (including free-fall lifeboats), rescue boats (including fast rescue boats), launching appliances and release gear.
    —    Survival craft types:
    a) single fall totally enclosed lifeboats with sprinkler and air systems;
    b) twin fall totally enclosed lifeboats with sprinkler and air systems;
    c) partially enclosed lifeboats;
    d) tender lifeboats;
    e) freefall lifeboats;
    f) open lifeboat;
    g) inflatable rescue boats;
    h) rigid rescue boats;
    i) semi-ridged inflatable rescue boats;
    j) rigid fast rescue boats;
    k) rigid inflatable fast rescue boats.
    —    Survival craft propulsion system types:
    a) inboard diesel engines;
    b) outboard engines;
    c) propeller drives;
    d) jet drives.
    —    Davit types:
    a) gravity single and twin fall outrigger;
    b) hydraulic single pivoting/luffing;
    c) hydraulic multi pivot/luffing;
    d) telescopic;
    e) gravity roller track;
    f) gravity free fall primary;
    g) free fall hydraulic secondary;
    h) A-frame hydraulic;
    i) single arm slewing (manual, electric);
    j) davits with stored power systems.
    —    Winch types:
    a) twin drum;
    b) single drum;
    c) gravity lowering, electric hoisting;
    d) gravity lowering, hydraulic hoisting;
    e) hydraulic hoisting and lowering.
    —    Hook release system types:
    a) on-load/off load (load not over centre);
    b) on-load/offload (load over centre);
    c) off load;
    d) freefall hydraulic;
    e) automatic off load.
