    This document contains information on the design and operational practices for launch vehicle orbital stages for mitigating space debris.
    This document provides information to engineers on what are required or recommended in the family of space debris mitigation standards to reduce the growth of space debris by ensuring that spacecraft is designed, operated, and disposed of in a manner that prevents them from generating debris throughout their orbital lifetime.
