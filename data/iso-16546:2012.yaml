    This International Standard specifies the equipment and procedures for determining the effects of successive cycling from dry conditions at −20 °C to wet conditions at 20 °C on the mechanical properties and moisture content of the product. It is applicable to thermal insulating products.
    It is intended to simulate freeze?thaw effects on thermal insulating products which are frequently exposed to water and low temperature conditions, e.g. inverted roofs and unprotected ground insulation.
    This test method is not recommended for all thermal insulating products. If relevant, the product standards will state for which products this International Standard is applicable.
