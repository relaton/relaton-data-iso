abstract:
- content: ISO 17942:2014 specifies the methods for the chemical analysis of fine
    boron nitride powders used as the raw material for fine ceramics. It stipulates
    the analysis methods of total boron, free boron, total nitrogen, aluminium, cadmium,
    calcium, chromium, cobalt, copper, iron, lead, magnesium, manganese, nickel, potassium,
    silicon, sodium, titanium, vanadium, zinc, carbon, and oxygen in boron nitride
    powders for fine ceramics. Total boron is determined by using either a fusion?titration
    method or a fusion?inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES).
    Free boron is determined by using either an acid digestion?ICP-OES or a methanol
    extraction?ICP-OES. If necessary, the boron amount which arises from the hydrolysis
    of boron nitride during sample treatment is corrected using spectrophotometry.
    Total nitrogen is determined by using either an acid pressure decomposition?distillation
    separation?titration method or an inert gas fusion?thermal conductivity method.
    Silicon is determined by using a fusion?ICP-OES. Aluminium, cadmium, calcium,
    chromium, cobalt, copper, iron, lead, magnesium, manganese, nickel, titanium,
    vanadium, zinc are determined by using an acid pressure decomposition?ICP-OES
    or a fusion?ICP-OES. Sodium and potassium are determined by using atomic absorption
    spectrometry (AAS), flame emission spectrometry (FES), or ICP-OES following acid
    pressure decomposition. Carbon is determined by using a combustion?IR absorption
    spectrometry or a combustion?thermal conductivity method. Oxygen is determined
    by using an inert gas fusion?IR absorption spectrometry.
