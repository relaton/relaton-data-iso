  content: The scope of ISO/TR 17427-4:2015 is, as an informative document, to identify
    potential critical minimum system requirements and behaviour for core systems
    issues that C-ITS service provision may face or introduce, to consider strategies
    for how to identify, control, limit or mitigate such issues. The objective of
    this Technical Report is to raise awareness of and consideration of such issues
    and to give pointers, where appropriate, to subject areas and, where available,
    to existing standards deliverables that provide specifications for all or some
    of these aspects. This Technical Report does not provide specifications for solutions
    of these issues.
