    ISO/TR 18147:2014 is intended for calculating the probability for solar energetic particle (SEP) to have an impact on materials, hardware, and biological objects.
    ISO/TR 18147:2014 establishes the differential energy spectra for the (0,1/103) MeV SEP fluences and/or peak fluxes in the near-earth space, beyond the earth magnetosphere during the missions any duration under varying solar activity.
    If additional prepositions are used, the method establishes the basic fluences and peak fluxes for their determination throughout the heliosphere. When the effect of the particle penetration into the magnetosphere is taken into account, the method establishes the basic fluences and peak fluxes for their determination on the near-earth spacecraft and manned station orbits.
    Because the occurrence of SEP is a process a probabilistic nature, fluences and peak fluxes calculation relate to the different levels of probability.
    The method is intended for specialists engaged in determination of radiation conditions in space.
