abstract:
- content: |-
    This document provides a basic step-by-step approach for achieving non-residential (net) zero-energy buildings (ZEBs). It also describes the basic concept of ZEBs and the items for consideration in this approach.
    The following are within the scope of this document:
    —    application to non-residential buildings;
    —    annual energy consumption of a ZEB (this includes the operating consumption of the building and excludes the energy consumed by the manufacturing of materials and equipment, and the energy consumed during construction);
    —    renewable energy supply (this can be on-site or off-site, depending on the policy and conditions of the country in which the supply is installed);
    —    application to any climate zone.
    The following are out of the scope of this document:
    —    recommendations or suggestions for the adoption of any specific technologies and/or equipment and materials that are expected to be continuously innovated (however it does stipulate the technologies for selection);
    —    specific methods or calculation formulae;
    —    commissioning methods.
