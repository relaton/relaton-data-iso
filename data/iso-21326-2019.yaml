    This document specifies test methods for efficiency of chemically or physically treated textile products against house dust mites.
    For the products treated by chemicals against house dust mites, the test methods specified in a) to c) are applied. For the physically treated products, the test method specified in d) is applied.
    a)    Repelling method by using Petri dish
    This method is applied to carpet, bedding surface fabric, bed sheeting, bed covering and blanket.
    b)    Repelling method by using glass tube (Methods A and B)
    This method is applied to wadding (bedding, etc.) with a fibre content of cotton, wool or synthetic fibre, feathers/down.
    c)    Proliferation method by using Petri dish (Method A) and using vial (Method B)
    Method A is applied to carpet, bedding surface fabric, bed sheeting, bed covering and blanket. Method B is applied to wadding.
    d)    Penetration method
    This method is applicable to the outer fabric of a futon, bed sheeting and bed covering. However, this method is not applicable to the multiple component non-woven fabrics and fibre products with the high stretch properties such as jersey fabrics.
