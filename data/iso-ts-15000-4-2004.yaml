  content: ISO 15000-4:2004 defines the interface between the registry and the registry
    clients, as well as the interaction protocols, message definitions and XML schema.
    The interface is intended to function as the basis for a more complete definition
    of the ebXML registry requirements in the future. The ebXML Registry provides
    a set of services that enable sharing of information between interested parties
    for the purpose of enabling business process integration between such parties
    based on the ebXML specifications. The shared information is maintained as objects
    in a repository and managed by the ebXML Registry Services defined in this document.
