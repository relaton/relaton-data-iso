    This document establishes the main requirements for:
    —    a choice of coating materials and coatings for space applications;
    —    processes and procedures for the verification of coating materials;
    —    processes of preparation and quality control of the painted surface;
    —    the quality control of the applied coatings.
    This document also describes the causes of possible defects in coatings.
    This document is applicable to coating materials and coatings based on them; it is intended for use by manufacturers of space systems products for various surfaces of spacecraft’s and its constitutive parts (on-board systems, facilities, tools, electronic component base products) with long active lifetimes.
