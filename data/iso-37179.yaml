abstract:
- content: "This document specifies principle and general requirements for smart community
    infrastructures contributing to disaster risk reduction. \nIt is intended to be
    used by stakeholders relevant to community infrastructures including community
    managers, planners, providers or administrators of community infrastructure services
    who wish to reduce disaster risk and enhance community resilience by using smart
    community infrastructures effectively. \nNote1: Smart community infrastructures

    In many, but not all, contexts, a community has a defined geographical boundary.
    A city is a type of community. [ISO 37101:2016]\n\nNote3: This project does not
    cover \"public service\" aspects but TC 268/SC1/WG6 will closely communicate with
