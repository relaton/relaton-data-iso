  content: "This proposal is the first of three separate, but linked, proposals. The
    deliverable consists of documentation that defines the processes and models for
    data exchange in agricultural irrigation. The scope of the set of three proposals
    is based on two major irrigation data processes:\n\n1.\tObservations: The field,
    atmospheric, plant, or other in situ measurements that apply to irrigation management.
    This includes weather stations, soil moisture sensors, or crop-related sensing.
    This work is an agricultural implementation of the ISO 19156:2011 standard for
    observations and measurements.\n2.\tOperations: All of the activities associated
    with the application of water with an irrigation system. This includes, but is
    not restricted to, management-level communications and record keeping. The operations
    data set is based around a Recommendation, which describes a suggested course
    of action; a Work Order, which describes a desired course of action; and a Work
    Record, which describes what actually happened. This work is based on, and extends,
    the ISO11783-10:2015 standard for communications between agricultural machinery
    and FMIS.\n\nDeliverables for this particular proposed part of the standard include
    definitions and examples for core concepts, processes, and objects used in the
    other parts:\n•\tBusiness processes associated with the irrigation field operation\n•\tThe
    Actors and their role(s) in the process\n•\tCore Documents and their relationships\n•\tCommon
    Components\n•\tIdentity - Compound Identifiers\n•\tTime, Space, People, Data pedigree,
    Geopolitical-context-dependent data\n•\tReference Data\n•\tSetup and Configuration
    Data\nThe proposal does not define how to generate irrigation prescriptions, or
    prescribe how to operate the specific mechanisms of a piece of irrigation equipment,
    such as sprinkler valves or center pivot end guns."
