  content: "ISO/IEC 29199-3:2010 specifies the use of JPEG XR coding for timed sequences
    of images (motion sequences) within files based on the ISO base media file format
    (ISO/IEC 15444-12).\nThe Motion JPEG XR file format is designed to contain one
    or more motion sequences of JPEG XR images, with their timing. It is intended
    as a ‘building block', specifying only the video format. An application would
    be expected to combine Motion JPEG XR with suitable audio, metadata, etc. for
    a complete application specification; that specification would normally select
    profiles and levels of Motion JPEG XR, and could also specify application profiles
    and levels that apply to the integration. \nMotion JPEG XR is expected to be used
    in a variety of applications, particularly where JPEG XR coding technology is
    already available for other reasons, or where the high-quality frame-based approach,
    with no inter-frame coding, is appropriate. \nMotion JPEG XR is a flexible format,
    permitting a wide variety of usages, such as editing, display, interchange, and
    streaming."
