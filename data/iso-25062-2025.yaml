abstract:
- content: |-
    This document describes the common industry format (CIF) for reporting usability evaluations. It provides a classification of evaluation approaches and the specifications for the content items (content elements) to be included in an evaluation report based on the selected evaluation approach(es). The intended users of the usability evaluation reports are identified, as well as the situations in which the usability evaluation report can be applied.
    The usability evaluation reports in this document are applicable to software and hardware systems and products or services used for predefined tasks (excluding generic products, such as a display screen or a keyboard). The content elements are intended to be used as part of system-level documentation resulting from development processes such as those in ISO 9241-210 and the ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 7 process standards (e.g. ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 on systems lifecycle management, ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207 on software lifecycle management and ISO/IEC 33001 on process capability assessment).
