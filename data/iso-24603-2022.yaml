    This document specifies requirements for the biobanking of human and mouse pluripotent stem cells (PSCs), including the collection of biological source material and associated data, establishment, expansion, characterization, quality control (QC), maintenance, preservation, storage, thawing, disposal, distribution and transport.
    This document is applicable to all organizations performing biobanking with human and mouse PSCs used for research and development.
    This document does not apply to cell lines used for in vivo application in humans, clinical applications or therapeutic use.
    NOTE       International, national or regional regulations or requirements, or multiple of them, can also apply to specific topics covered in this document.
