abstract:
- content: "This document specifies requirements for the biobanking of deep-sea biological
    materials including the collection, processing, transportation and storage of
    deep-sea biological materials. \n\nThis document is applicable only to deep-sea
    biological materials that can be used for biomolecular processing, e.g., nucleic
    acids, proteins, and metabolites.\n\nThis document is applicable to all organizations
    performing research and development on deep-sea biological material.\n\nNOTE\tInternational,
    national or regional regulations or requirements or multiple of these can also
    apply to specific topics covered in this document."
