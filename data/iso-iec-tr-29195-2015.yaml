  content: ISO/IEC TR 29195:2015 provides recommended best practices and processes
    for automated border control systems using biometrics to verify an identity claim
    by a traveller that uses an ePassport or equivalent identity card as the basis
    for the claim. It indicates areas that organisations proposing to use biometric
    technologies will need to address during design, deployment, and operation. Much
    of the information is generic to all types of applications especially around signage;
    however, some information will be specific to the modality of biometric technology
    used and how that technology is physically implemented.
