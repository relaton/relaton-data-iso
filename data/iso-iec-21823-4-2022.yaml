abstract:
- content: 'ISO/IEC 21823-4:2022 specifies the IoT interoperability from a syntactic
    point of view. In ISO/IEC 21823-1: Framework [2], five facets are described for
    IoT interoperability, i.e. transport, semantic, syntactic, behavioural and policy.
    In this document, the following specifications for IoT interoperability from syntactic
    viewpoint are included; – A principle of how to achieve syntactic interoperability
    among IoT systems which include IoT devices – Requirements on information related
    to IoT devices for syntactic interoperability – A framework for processes on developing
    information exchange rules related to IoT devices from the syntactic viewpoint'
