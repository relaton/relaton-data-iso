abstract:
- content: ISO 23693 part 1 aims to simulate the mechanical loads that could be imparted
    to passive fire protection (PFP) materials and systems by explosions resulting
    from releases of flammable gas, pressurised liquefied gas, flashing liquid fuels,
    or dust that may precede a fire. Explosions can give rise to pressure and drag
    forces and damage to PFP materials in a gas explosion can be caused by the direct
    effects of pressure and drag loadings and by the deflection of the substrate supporting
    the PFP material. This part of the ISO 23693 series deals with tests to assess
    the performance of PFP material to the combined effects of pressure and drag loading
    that occur in the flow path of a gas explosion. This part of the standard excludes
    specimens whereby the substrate is subject to plastic deformation or brittle failure.
