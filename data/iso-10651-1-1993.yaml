abstract:
- content: Is to be used in conjunction with IEC 601-1:1988. Specifies relevant requirements
    (general requirements, environmental conditions, protection against electric shock
    hazards, protection against excessive temperatures and other safety hazards, accuracy
    of operating data and protection against hazardous output, constructional requirements,
    additional requirements) for lung ventilators, excluding ventilators primarily
    intended for anaesthesia, home care, transport, and other devices such as jet
    and high-frequency ventilators. The requirements of this standard take precedence
    over those of IEC 601-1.
