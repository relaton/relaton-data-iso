abstract:
- content: ISO 28079:2009 specifies a method for measuring the Palmqvist toughness
    of hardmetals and cermets at room temperature by an indentation method. ISO 28079:2009
    applies to a measurement of toughness, called Palmqvist toughness, calculated
    from the total length of cracks emanating from the corners of a Vickers hardness
    indentation, and it is intended for use with metal-bonded carbides and carbonitrides
    (normally called hardmetals, cermets or cemented carbides). The test procedures
    proposed in ISO 28079:2009 are intended for use at ambient temperatures, but can
    be extended to higher or lower temperatures by agreement. The test procedures
    proposed in ISO 28079:2009 are also intended for use in a normal laboratory-air
    environment. They are not intended for use in corrosive environments, such as
    strong acids or seawater.
