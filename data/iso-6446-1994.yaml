abstract:
- content: Specifies requirements for rubber materials used in elastomeric bridge
    bearings, which may be of the plain-pad or laminated type. Also specifies methods
    of test and describes procedures for the preparation of test pieces from finished
    bearings. Does not contain aspects relating to design properties and quality control
    of the complete bearing, except where the complete bearing is used as the source
    of samples and test pieces to determine properties of the rubber material. Does
    not include dimensions and tolerances.
