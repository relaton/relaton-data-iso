  content: The sulphate present in a test portion is reduced to sulphide by a mixture
    of hydriodic and phosphinic (hypophosphorous) acids. The hydrogen sulphide evolved
    is absorbed in an excess of cadmium acetate solution. The cadmium sulphide formed
    is oxidized by an excess of standard volumetric potassium iodate/iodide solsution,
    and the excess iodine is titrated with standard volumetric sodium thiosulphate
    solution, using starch as indicator. The method is applicable to products having
    sulphate contents between 0.2 and 6 % (m/m).
