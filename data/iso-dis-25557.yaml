  content: "This document would specify requirements and recommendations for the provision
    of health and social care services for older persons provided by healthcare and
    social care personnel, irrespective of whether the service is provided in the
    persons own home or in a care home. The services concerned also include those
    offered to older people who do not reside permanently at a care home, such as
    temporary accommodations.\nCare services are provided in a variety of settings.
    While this document would focus on those delivered in care facilities including
    preventive, responsive, and palliative care, many of the requirements can be applied
    to the provision of care services in any setting. \nService provision is based
    on the individual needs and preferences of the older person to assist self-determination,
    participation, and a safe and secure old age.\n\nThe document would encompass
    the compressive needs of care home residents and the workforce, taking into consideration
    principles of equity, diversity, and inclusion.\nThis document would apply to
    all providers of care and support to older persons irrespective of size, structure,
    legal set up, or funding model (i. e. public or private).\nCare homes, also referred
    to as residential, long-term care homes, continuing care, personal care, or nursing
    homes, are residential settings where the majority of residents often live with
    complex health care needs. They provide a range of professional health services,
    lodging, food, and personal care (e.g., assistance with everyday activities) for
    their residents 24 hours/day, 7 days a week.\nThe document is structured to provide
    clear requirements and accountabilities to enable care home teams, governing bodies,
    and other stakeholders to work together toward a common vision for resident-centred,
    high-quality care.\n\nThis document would be intended to be used in quality assurance,
    follow-up, evaluation, and development of such services and can be used as a basis
    for procurement, training, supervision, and certification.\n\nThis document would
    not cover standardization of clinical guidelines and/or medical devices."
