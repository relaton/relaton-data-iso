  content: Threads are removed from rectangular strips of fabric, the straightened
    length of a portion of them is determined and their mass is determined either
    in equilibrium with the standard atmosphere for testing textiles (method A) or
    oven-dry plus the commercial allowance given in ISO 6741/4 (method B). Linear
    density is calculated from the mass and the sum of the straightened length.
