abstract:
- content: "ISO 13194:2011 specifies the definitions, principal requirements and test
    methods for box pallets of all materials. It applies to box pallets, including
    post pallets and cage pallets, but is not intended to apply to tank and silo pallets
    as defined in ISO 445. It also applies to box pallets which can be stacked and
    handled by forklift trucks or pallet trucks, but excludes other lifting devices.
    \nISO 13194:2011 addresses the performance of the box pallet only, and not its
    contents."
