abstract:
- content: |-
    ISO/IEC TR 14143-3:2003 establishes a framework for verifying the statements of an FSM Method and/or for conducting tests requested by the verification sponsor, relative to the following performance properties:
    - repeatability and reproducibility;
    - accuracy;
    - convertibility;
    - discrimination threshold;
    - applicability to Functional Domains.
    NOTE Statements and test requests relative to other performance properties are outside the scope of ISO/IEC TR 14143-3:2003.
    ISO/IEC TR 14143-3:2003 aims to ensure that the output from the verification is objective, impartial, consistent and repeatable.
    The verification report, produced as a result of applying ISO/IEC TR 14143-3:2003, will enable the prospective user to select the FSM Method which best meets their needs.
