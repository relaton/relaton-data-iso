  content: Specifies the acceptance test, which verifies that the performance of a
    coordinate measuring machine (CMM) and its probing system is as stated by the
    manufacturer, the reverification test, which enables the user to reverify CMM
    performance and the CMM probing system periodically, and the interim check, which
    enables the user to make checks on a CMM and the CMM probing system between regular
    reverification tests.
