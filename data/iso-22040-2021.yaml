    This document provides the principles for implementing life cycle management (LCM) of concrete structures throughout the stages of planning, design, execution, use and end-of-life, as well as the framework and procedures for LCM.
    This document is applicable not only to new structures but also existing structures. It is also applicable to the entire life cycle and each one or more stages composing the life cycle of a structure.
    NOTE     Details in the procedures and specific methodologies for management in each stage of structure's life cycle based on this document is established separately.
