    This standard specifies communication protocols enabling interoperability among industrial autonomous mobile robot (AMR) systems produced by different vendors.

    This standard covers AMRs, other aspects of AMR systems such as AMR fleet manager equipment, and other enterprise resources that would communicate with the AMRs in an industrial environment.

    Exclusions:
    • Safety-related requirements for AMR systems
    • Mobile machines operating on public roads
