  content: The principles are applicable to consumer products, services and a combination
    of both. They may usefully be followed by bodies and associations which conduct
    comparative testing programmes. The purpose of this Guide is to enable meaningful
    test results and information to be presented in a way which will help consumers
    and others to make an informed choice suitable to their own needs. The notes offer
    some but not all the means of applying the principles.
