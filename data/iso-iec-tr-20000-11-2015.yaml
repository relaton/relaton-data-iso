    ISO/IEC TR 20000-11:2015 is a Technical Report that provides guidance on the relationship between ISO/IEC 20000?1:2011 and a commonly used service management framework, ITIL. It can be used by any organization or person wishing to understand how ITIL can be used with ISO/IEC 20000?1:2011, including:
    a)   a service provider that has demonstrated or intends to demonstrate conformity to the requirements specified in ISO/IEC 20000?1:2011 and is seeking guidance on the use of ITIL to establish and improve an SMS and the services;
    c)   a service provider that already uses ITIL and is seeking guidance on how ITIL can be used to support efforts to demonstrate conformity to the requirements specified in ISO/IEC 20000?1:2011;
    d)   an assessor or auditor who wishes to understand the use of ITIL as support to achieve the requirements specified in ISO/IEC 20000?1:2011.
    The correlations provided in this part of ISO/IEC 20000 are for ISO/IEC 20000?1:2011 and ITIL?2011.
    Clause 4 describes how ITIL can support the demonstration of conformity to ISO/IEC 20000?1:2011. Clause 5 relates chapters in ITIL to clauses in ISO/IEC 20000?1:2011. The tables in Annex A and Annex B relate terms, clauses and processes in ISO/IEC 20000?1:2011 to ITIL.
