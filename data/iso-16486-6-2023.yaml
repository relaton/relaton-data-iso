    This document specifies a code of practice dealing with unplasticized polyamide (PA-U) pipes and fittings for buried pipeline systems outside buildings and designed to transport gaseous fuels (as defined in ISO 16486-1, e.g. methane, LPG, manufactured gas and hydrogen) within the temperature range –20 °C to +40 °C. This document also gives appropriate temperature-related requirements.
    The code of practice covers mains and service lines whose components are prepared for fusion or mechanical jointing and gives instructions for the design, storage, handling, transportation, laying conditions and fusion quality control of PA-U pipes and fittings as well as subsequent joint testing, backfilling, pipe system testing and commissioning.
    NOTE          Principal information for rehabilitation can be found in ISO 11295 for classification, ISO 11299-1 and ISO 11299-2 for renovation, and ISO 21225-1 and ISO 21225-2 for trenchless replacement.
    More detailed national standards or codes of practice can exist. This document is intended to be applied in association with such national standards or codes of practice related to the above-mentioned basic principles.
    The jointing methods covered by this document are:
    —     butt fusion jointing (see Annex A);
    —     electrofusion jointing (see Annex B) and
    —     mechanical jointing (see Annex C).
    In the case of ground movement or shaking (e.g. earthquakes, etc.) precautions mentioned in this document can need to be implemented following guidelines provided by authorities (e.g. EN 1998-4, EN 12007-1:2012, Annex A etc.).
    Workers' health and safety issues are outside the scope of this document
