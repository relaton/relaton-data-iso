abstract:
- content: "ISO 15623:2002 specifies performance requirements and test procedures
    for systems capable of warning the driver of short inter-vehicle distance and
    closing speed which may cause a rear-end collision with other vehicles, including
    motor cycles, ahead of the subject vehicle while it is operating at ordinary speed.
    \nISO 15623:2002 is applicable to operations on roads with curve radii over 125
    m as well as higher radius curves."
