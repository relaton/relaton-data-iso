    This document specifies the designation and the characterization methods metallic coatings that provide electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding for parts fabricated from plastics, ceramics, glasses and other materials.
    The designation consists of the EMI shielding effectiveness in a specific frequency range and the adhesion of metallic coatings to the substrate, as well as the substrate material and the principal component, manufacturing process and thickness of the metallic coatings.
    The characterization methods consist of the methods to determine the EMI shielding effectiveness of metallic coatings and those to evaluate the adhesion of metallic coatings to the substrate.
