abstract:
- content: "This document specifies definitions of and general requirements to level
    indicators, intended for use on the types of motor vehicles defined in ISO 3833.
    It also provides general design principles, and specifies requirements for instructions
    and marking.\nThis document is applicable to vehicles using gaseous fuels in accordance
    with ISO 16861. It is not applicable to the following:\na)       fuel containers,
    except to the extent explicitly referred to in this document;\nb)       stationary,
    ship, railroad vehicle or aircraft dimethyl ether (DME) engine installations;\nc)       
    electronic fuel management; \nd)       refuelling receptacles.\nNOTE 1       
    It is recognized that miscellaneous component properties not specifically addressed
    herein can be examined for compliance with the criteria of any applicable part
    of the ISO 22760 series, including subjecting the component to the appropriate
    functional tests.\nNOTE 2        All pressures referred to in this document are
    gauge pressures unless otherwise specified."
