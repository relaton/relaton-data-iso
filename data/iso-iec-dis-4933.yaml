    This document specifies a unification module for input actions, including its framework, requirements and recommendations, for consistently accessing the operations across multiple types of devices. This document recognizes the input actions as user behaviours that are commonly used to manipulate system or application operations (functions) through user interfaces. It also identifies the need and use cases of unifying input actions across devices.
    This document does not specify parameter settings and details of the input actions. This document is applicable to all types of organizations.
