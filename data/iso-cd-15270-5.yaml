abstract:
- content: This document establishes the terms, definitions, methodologies, and calculations
    that are necessary for the recovery of compostable plastic waste through organic
    recycling. The document identifies the different types of organic recycling technologies
    used in the recovery and subsequent recycling of plastics waste arising from pre-consumer
    and post-consumer sources, including the recovery of waste caused by dispersion
    into the environment. This document also establishes the requirements and calculations
    to be considered in evaluating organic recycling inputs and outputs and determining
    output classifications for the recycling operation and the downstream integration
    points. The document also outlines general quality requirements to be applied
    in all steps of the recovery process, and provides general recommendations for
    inclusion in material standards, test standards and product specifications. The
    process stages, requirements, recommendations and terminology presented in this
    document are intended to be of general applicability. This document does not establish
    test methods and criteria for the definition of the organic recyclability (e.g.
    compostability) of plastic materials and products.  This document does not address
    home composting because this gardening practice cannot be classified as recycling.
