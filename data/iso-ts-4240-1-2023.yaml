    This document specifies the bubble volume concentration and bubble bed depth measurement methods by online particle counter for checking DAF process performance in plant.
    The test method of bubble volume concentration is made by measuring bubble size distribution in contact zone of DAF tank and calculating using formula. And bubble bed depth is evaluated by measuring the number of bubbles and particles according to the depth at five points in separation zone of DAF tank.
    This document provides the advantages and limitations of using online particle counter in plant.
