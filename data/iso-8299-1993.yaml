- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: 'The method is based on isotope ratio measurements in solutions by thermal
    ionization mass spectrometry. Includes the following steps: dilution, spike addition,
    isotope exchange chemistry, ion exchange purification/separation, preparation
    of filaments, mass spectrometric measurements and calculation of isotopic and
    elemental concentrations. Pu 238 is determined by means of alpha spectrometry
    if interferences from U 238 cannot be eliminated. Is applicable to solutions of
    irradiated fuels from boiling water or pressurized water reactors and, after modification
    of chemical separation and spike solution, also to other types of fuel.'
