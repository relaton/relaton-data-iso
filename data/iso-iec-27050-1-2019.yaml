    Electronic discovery is the process of discovering pertinent Electronically Stored Information (ESI) or data by one or more parties involved in an investigation or litigation, or similar proceeding. This document provides an overview of electronic discovery. In addition, it defines related terms and describes the concepts, including, but not limited to, identification, preservation, collection, processing, review, analysis, and production of ESI. This document also identifies other relevant standards (e.g. ISO/IEC 27037) and how they relate to, and interact with, electronic discovery activities.
    This document is relevant to both non-technical and technical personnel involved in some or all of the electronic discovery activities.
