abstract:
- content: This document specifies a basic laboratory test method for deinkability
    of woodfree printed paper products as a mixture under alkaline conditions by means
    of single stage flotation deinking and fatty acid-based collector chemistry. The
    woodfree printed paper product of interest is tested as a mixture containing 10 %
    by weight of the woodfree printed paper with the balance comprising a mixture
    of printed wood-containing paper.
