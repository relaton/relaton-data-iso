- content: |-
    This document specifies safety and performance requirements for the design, marking, assembly, and testing of two wheeled electrically power assisted cycles (hereafter EPACs), fully-assembled EPACs and subassemblies, and provides guidelines for information supplied by the manufacturers (i.e. instructions on the use and care of such EPACs).
    This document applies to two wheeled EPACs that have a maximum saddle height of 635 mm or more and are intended for private and commercial use with exception of EPACs intended for hire from unattended stations.
    This document is intended to cover all common significant hazards, hazardous situations and events listed in 5.3 of EPACs, when used as intended or under conditions of misuse that are reasonably foreseeable by the manufacturer.
    This document specifies requirements and test methods for engine power management systems, electrical circuits including the charger for the assessment of the design and assembly of EPACs and sub-assemblies for systems having a Safety Extra Low Voltage (SELV) maximum voltage up to 60 V d.c. including tolerances.
