    This Technical Report describes the functions that may be supported by systems using ISO/IEC 16500. These
    functions have been derived by analyzing the requirements of a number of example applications from the
    viewpoints of a range of participants, including:
    _ content providers _ IPR holders
    _ service providers _ rights collection agencies
    _ delivery system providers _ regulatory authorities
    _ end-users _ business support services
    _ equipment manufacturers _ financial services
    Applications, tools and functions are described from a behavioral viewpoint. The report does not assume any
    technical implementation for a particular service.
    The Technical Report consists of a main body, and a series of Annexes. The main body introduces the concept of
    a contour in the context of ISO/IEC 16500 and outlines its use in compliance and conformance definitions. The
    behaviour and parameters of sets of core functions and generic tools that can be derived from the functions are
    then presented. Nineteeen example applications are analysed and described in terms of generic and application
    specific functionalities. The main body concludes with an integrated summary listing of the functionalities
    required by users and providers of digital audio-visual applications and systems organised under a set of
    functional groupings . The User and Market Requirements and the corresponding Functional Requirements
    required for the IDB (Interactive Digital Broadcast) contour are defined in Annex A. Similar information is
    provided in Annex B for the EDB (Enhanced Digital Broadcast) contour. This overall structure is designed to
    readily incorporate future descriptions of new core functions, generic tools, sample applications and additional
    contours.
