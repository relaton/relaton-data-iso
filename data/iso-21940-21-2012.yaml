    ISO 21940-21:2012 specifies requirements for evaluating the performance of machines for balancing rotating components by the following tests: a) test for minimum achievable residual unbalance, Umar test; b) test for unbalance reduction ratio, URR test; c) test for couple unbalance interference on single-plane machines; d) compensator test.
    These tests are performed during acceptance of a balancing machine and also later on a periodic basis to ensure that the balancing machine is capable of handling the actual balancing tasks. For periodic tests, simplified procedures are specified. Tests for other machine capacities and performance parameters, however, are not contained in ISO 21940-21:2012.
    For these tests, three types of especially prepared proving rotors are specified, covering a wide range of applications on horizontal and vertical balancing machines. An annex describes recommended modifications of proving rotors prepared in acccordance with ISO 2953:1985.
    Moreover, ISO 21940-21:2012 stresses the importance attached to the form in which the balancing machine characteristics are specified by the manufacturer. Adoption of the format specified enables users to compare products from different manufacturers. Additionally, in an annex, guidelines are given on the information by which users provide their data and requirements to a balancing machine manufacturer.
    ISO 21940-21:2012 is applicable to balancing machines that support and rotate rotors with rigid behaviour at balancing speed and that indicate the amounts and angular locations of a required unbalance correction in one or more planes. Therefore it is applicable to rotors with rigid behaviour as well as to rotors with shaft-elastic behaviour balanced in accordance with low-speed balancing procedures. It covers both soft-bearing balancing machines and hard-bearing balancing machines. Technical requirements for such balancing machines are included; however, special features, such as those associated with automatic correction, are excluded.
    ISO 21940-21:2012 does not specify balancing criteria; such criteria are specified in ISO 1940-1 and ISO 11342 (only low-speed balancing procedures apply).
