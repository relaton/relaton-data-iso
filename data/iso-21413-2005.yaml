abstract:
- content: ISO 21413:2005 develops procedures and prescribes the minimum accuracy
    required of water-level measurements made in wells using graduated steel tapes,
    electric tapes and air lines. Procedures and accuracy requirements for measuring
    water levels in a flowing well are also included, as are procedures required to
    establish a permanent measuring point. ISO 21413:2005 discusses the advantages
    and limitations of each method and requirements for recording the data. ISO 21413:2005
    does not include methods that use automated electrical or mechanical means to
    measure and record water levels.
