    ISO 16063-41:2011 specifies the instrumentation and procedures for performing primary and secondary calibrations of rectilinear laser vibrometers in the frequency range typically between 0,4 Hz and 50 kHz. It specifies the calibration of laser vibrometer standards designated for the calibration of either laser vibrometers or mechanical vibration transducers in accredited or non-accredited calibration laboratories, as well as the calibration of laser vibrometers by a laser vibrometer standard or by comparison to a reference transducer calibrated by laser interferometry. The specification of the instrumentation contains requirements on laser vibrometer standards.
    Rectilinear laser vibrometers can be calibrated in accordance with ISO 16063-41:2011 if they are designed as laser optical transducers with, or without, an indicating instrument to sense the motion quantities of displacement or velocity, and to transform them into proportional (i.e. time-dependent) electrical output signals. These output signals are typically digital for laser vibrometer standards and usually analogue for laser vibrometers. The output signal or the reading of a laser vibrometer can be the amplitude and, in addition, occasionally the phase shift of the motion quantity (acceleration included). In ISO 16063-41:2011 the modulus calibration is explicitly specified.
