  content: 'ISO 24335:2006 specifies how to determine the impact resistance of laminate
    floor covering elements. The test described measures the ability of the surface
    layer to withstand impact from both small and large objects dropped on the floor
    covering. The testing is destructive by means of the impact on the surface layer
    from one small and one larger steel ball simulating different scenarios. The force
    of the small steel ball and the drop height of the larger steel ball are used
    to define the ability for a laminate floor covering element to withstand impact. '
