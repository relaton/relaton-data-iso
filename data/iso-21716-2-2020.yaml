  content: This document specifies a laboratory test method for screening anti-fouling
    paints in a flow-through system using barnacle cyprid larvae as the test organism.
    It is intended to be used in conjunction with ISO 21716-1, which specifies the
    general requirements. The purpose of the test is to determine if there is a difference
    in barnacle settlement on painted test panels compared with barnacle settlement
    on inert non-toxic control panels under the conditions of the test. Examples of
    statistical analysis to determine if the difference in barnacle settlement is
    statistically significant are given in Annex A.
