- content: Fundamentals are outlined which may be used in order to comply with the
    definitions of ISO 1101. The methods described do not provide for a unique interpretation
    of the requirements of ISO 1101 and differ from each other, however, they form
    a reference document for coordination and agreements. Not all verification pronciples
    are given for the different types of geometrical tolerances,and the numbering
    shall not be regarded as a classification of priority. The symbols and methods
    mentioned are mot intended for application on end-product drawings.
