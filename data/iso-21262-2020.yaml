    This document gives safety requirements for the application, operation, maintenance, transport, tow, assembly and storage of industrial trucks (hereafter referred to as trucks) as defined in ISO 5053‑1.
    It applies to the following truck types:
    a)   counterbalance lift trucks;
    b)   reach trucks (with retractable mast or retractable fork arm carriage);
    c)   straddle trucks;
    d)   pallet-stacking trucks;
    e)   platform trucks;
    f)    double stackers;
    g)   side-loading trucks (one side only);
    h)   lateral-stacking trucks (both sides), and lateral- and front-stacking trucks;
    i)     order-picking trucks;
    j)     bidirectional and multidirectional trucks;
    k)   counterbalance container handlers;
    l)     articulated counterbalance lift trucks;
    m)  variable-reach trucks;
    n)   pallet trucks;
    o)   platform and stillage trucks;
    p)   tractors with a drawbar pull up to and including 20 000 N;
    q)   burden and personnel carriers;
    r)    trucks powered by battery, diesel, gasoline or gas (e.g. LPG, CNG, LNG).
    Automated functions and driverless variants of the above list of trucks are also considered part of this scope.
