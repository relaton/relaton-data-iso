abstract:
- content: "ISO 16234:2006 describes an open-loop test method for determining vehicle
    reactions during a straight-line braking manoeuvre on a surface having a split
    coefficient of friction. \nIt applies to heavy vehicles, i.e. commercial vehicles,
    commercial vehicle combinations, buses and articulated buses as defined in ISO
    3833 (trucks and trailers with maximum weight above 3,5 tonnes and buses and articulated
    buses with maximum weight above 5 tonnes, according to ECE and EC vehicle classification,
    categories M3, N2, N3, O3 and O4).\nThe method is limited to vehicles in which
    at least the first unit is equipped with an anti-lock braking system. It is valid
    for braking with service-brake systems only or in combination with retarders and/or
    engine brakes."
