  content: Fibre Channel provides a general data transport vehicle for Upper Level
    Protocols (ULPs) such as Intelligent Peripheral Interface (IPI) and Small Computer
    System Interface (SCSI) command sets, the High-Performance Parallel Interface
    (HIPPI) data framing, IP (Internet Protocol), ANSI/IEEE 802.2, and others. This
    part of ISO/IEC 14165 describes a communication interface between a channel and
    I/O control units that utilize the Single-Byte Command Code Sets (SBCCS) as implemented
    in a wide range of data processing systems. It employs information formats and
    signalling protocols that provide a uniform means for communicating with various
    types of I/O control units, facilitating a high bandwidth, high performance and
    long distance information exchange environment. The protocol, abbreviated FC-SB-2,
    is intended for use with ANSI X3.230, FC-PH and its subsequent enhancements which
    specify the Fibre Channel Physical and Signalling Interface. FC-SB-2 is one of
    a number of Fibre Channel protocol mappings, referred to as FC-4s. The reader
    should be familiar with FC-PH, Single-Byte Command Code Sets Connection (SBCON)
    Architecture (ANSI X3.296-1997).
