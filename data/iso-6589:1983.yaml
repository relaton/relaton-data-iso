  content: Specifies the test method to be used in laboratories for assessing the
    air permeability of non-opening joints between components in the exterior walls
    of buildings, whether the joints have been subjected to prior ageing or not. Does
    not apply to joints within components (for example the joint between glass fixed
    in a window frame and sealed with a glazing compound).
