    This document specifies a micrographic method based on comparison charts for determining the degree of spheroidisation of carbides after annealing of wire rod, wire or bars made of non-alloy and low alloy steels intended for cold heading and cold extrusion. The range of carbon content is up to 1,20 % C.
    In addition, Annex A includes a method based on machine vision for routine measurements.
