  content: 'Cancels and replaces the first edition (1985). Specifies a method for
    measuring the noise emitted by passenger cars in motion. The method is based on
    statistical studies of the use of cars in urban driving. The specifications are
    intended to reproduce the noise level which is exceeded during only 5 % of the
    total driving time in urban traffic flow of irregular character which requires
    the use of intermediate gears. The test method calls for an acoustical environment
    which can only be obtained in an extensive open space. Such conditions can usually
    be provided for: type approval measurements of vehicles; measurements at the manufacturing
    stage and at official testing stations.'
