  content: This International Standard specifies methods for evaluating the performance
    of engines designed for mopeds as defined in ISO 3833, in particular with a view
    to the presentation of power curves and specific fuel consumption at full load
    as a function of engine speed, for net power assessment. It is applicable to reciprocating
    internal combustion engines (spark-ignition), excluding free-piston engines, and
    rotary piston engines, either naturally aspirated or pressure-charged and equipped
    with either mechanical pressure-charger or turbocharger.
