abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC19763-1:2015 (Metamodel framework for interoperability) (MFI) family
    of standards. As the first part of MFI, this part provides an overview of the
    whole of MFI. In particular, the purpose, the underlying concepts, the overall
    architecture and the requirements for the development of other standards within
    the MFI family are described.\nMFI provides a set of normative metamodels to enable
    the registration of many different types of model. Each of these metamodels is
    expressed as a UML Class Diagram. \nMFI is evolving. Currently, in addition to
    this part, the MFI family comprises:\n·         A core model and facilities for
    the basic mapping of models (Part 10)\n·         A metamodel for ontology registration
    (Part 3)\n·         A metamodel for process model registration (Part 5)\n·         A
    metamodel for service model registration (Part 7)\n·         A metamodel for role
    and goal model registration (Part 8)\n·         A Technical Report describing
    on demand model selection based on RGPS (Role, Goal, Process and Service) (Part
    9)\n·         A metamodel for information model registration (Part 12)\n·         A
    metamodel for form design registration (Part 13)\n·         A metamodel for a
    registry summary (Part 6)\nThese parts are described in more detail in Annex A."
