abstract:
- content: "The purpose of ISO/IEC 23000-6 Professional archival application format
    (PA-AF) is to provide a standardized packaging format for digital files. This
    packaging format can also serve as an implementation of the information package
    specified by the Reference Model of Open Archival Information System (OAIS). The
    OAIS Reference Model is a framework for understanding and applying concepts necessary
    for long-term digital information preservation (where \"long-term\" is long enough
    to be concerned about changing technologies). In addition, PA-AF can also be used
    as an intermediate or exchange packaging format for any kind of multimedia content.\nPA-AF
    specifies the following: a metadata format to describe the original structure
    of digital files archived in a PA-AF file; a metadata format to describe context
    information related to a PA-AF file and digital files archived in it; a metadata
    format to describe necessary information to reverse the pre-processing processes
    applied to digital files prior to archiving them in a PA-AF file; and a file format
    for carriage of the metadata formats and digital files.\nWhile a general archival
    process may include processes ranging from creation, delivery to the archival
    system, to dissemination to consumers, PA-AF is limited in scope as follows. PA-AF
    specifies neither how to create input content nor any agreement on how the content
    should be handled and delivered to the archiving process. PA-AF assumes that input
    content for the archiving process is available in an appropriate digital format.
    PA-AF specifies the format of a digital archive produced by the archival process.
    It does not specify how the archive output by the archival process is disseminated
    to end-users.\nNote that the archiving policy and agreements are not included
    in the scope of PA-AF. PA-AF is independent from any kind of compression scheme
    or any kind of metadata format. PA-AF provides a mechanism for identifying the
    pre-processing tools applied to the archived content files. Any kind of compression
    tool or encryption tool can be specified as an external pre-processing tool. In
    addition, though PA-AF optionally provides a predefined minimum set of descriptive
    metadata for its archived contents, any kind of application- specific meta-information
    can be stored in the PA-AF package as a content file or files if the archive's
    policy or agreements require it. For this purpose, PA-AF provides a mechanism
    for linking that meta-information to the archived content file. \nIn the second
    edition, the maximum number of files that can be packed in a PA-AF file is extended
    to more than 65535. The latest reference software and conformance bitstreams are
    also included."
