    ISO 20038:2017 defines a method for packaging cryptographic keys for transport. This method can also be used for the storage of keys under an AES key. The method uses the block cipher AES as the wrapping cipher algorithm.
    Other methods for wrapping keys are outside the scope of this document but can use the authenticated encryption algorithms specified in ISO/IEC 19772.
