  content: 'Is complementary to ISO 2859. Object of the methods laid down is to ensure
    that lots of an acceptable quality have a high probability of acceptance and that
    the probability of rejection of inferior lots is as high as possible. To be used
    under the following conditions: inspection procedure to be applied to a continuous
    series of lots of discrete products supplied by one producer using one production
    process; only a single quality characteristic is considered which must be measurable
    on a continuous scale; production is stable and quality characteristic is distributed
    normally; a contract or standard defines an upper and/or a lower specification
    limit.'
