    This document specifies requirements and test methods for a fishing rod type telescopic ladder.
    This document applies to a fishing rod type telescopic ladder. The main components of the fishing rod
    type telescopic ladder are fiber reinforced plastic pipes and engineering plastic connectors.
    The fishing rod type telescopic ladder has the advantages of light weight, high strength, corrosion
    resistance, good anti-static and fireproof performance.
    The fishing rod type telescopic ladder is widely used in chemical industry, electric power, rail transit
    pipe gallery and other places that need explosion-proof, anti-static, anti-electric shock. In addition, it
    can be used as a daily work and home climbing tools replacing metal ladder and bamboo ladder for its
    light weight and small size.
    The structure design of the ladder is not involved in this document.
