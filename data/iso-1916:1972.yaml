abstract:
- content: The principle of the method consists in determination of the sodium oxide
    content by addition of an excess of a solution of hydrochloric acid and back titration
    with a standard volumetric solution of sodium hydroxide in presence of methyl
    red/bromocresol green as indicator. In the same solution, titration of the boric
    oxide with standard volumetric solution of sodium hydroxide in the presence of
    mannitol or sorbitol, using phenolphthalein as indicator. Determination of the
    loss on ignition by weighing a test portion into a platinum crucible and heating
    in an electric furnace, maintained at (900 +- 50 ) °C, for 15 min. The loss on
    ingnition is expressed conventionally as the water content.
