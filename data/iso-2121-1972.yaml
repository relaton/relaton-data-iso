abstract:
- content: The method relates to the determination of the "volatile water", that which
    volatilizes at the same time as the chlorine. It is applicable to products having
    a water content greater than 0,0005 % (m/m). It should not be applied to samples
    stored in bottles subject to corrosion. The principle consists in absorption of
    the water by passing the gasified sample into tared absorbers containing phosphorus
    pentoxide or magnesium perchlorate. Elimination of the gaseous chlorine and volatile
    impurities by flushing with air or dry nitrogen heated to 80 °C. Absorption of
    the chlorine in a tared bottle containing sodium hydroxide solution. Weighing
    of the absorbers to determine, by difference from the original masses, the mass
    of water.
