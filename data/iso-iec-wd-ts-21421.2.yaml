    This document provides guidance on the specific considerations that need to be given when using
    biometrics for major incident response. The following aspects are included within the scope of this
    document:
    • managing people and their identities (living or deceased) to co-ordinate the emergency response
    effort
    • linking reported missing persons to unidentified victims, reuniting relatives and loved ones
    • keeping track/account of persons that have been displaced from their homes, countries or present
    domicile
    • planning the use of biometrics and identity management for a major event where the safety and
    security of large numbers of people congregated together are concerns.
    • the use of biometric identifiers such as fingerprints, face, DNA, dental information to identify victims
    caught up in a disaster, emergency, or crisis
    • technical challenges such as biometric capture, enrolment, quality, building and accessing searchable
    data collections for high volumes of data, and interoperability
    • societal and ethical concerns relating to privacy and vulnerability of identities, both in the use of
    biometrics and as a result of the incident
    • highlight examples of evolving biometric technologies and emerging capabilities, for example mobile,
    field deployable or wearable technologies and where these may be of value.
    It is beyond the scope of this document:
    • to go into any detail on the handling of biometric samples or data for societal or cultural
    considerations, such as ethical, religious, cultural beliefs and practices.
    • to consider the age determination of the subjects involved in the accident in correlation with
    biometrics. Although aging effects should be considered as an important factor that needs to be
    considered this document does not describe specific technical approaches to address them.
    • to consider bias in emergency medical care whether it be during a major incident response or during
    routinary emergency care.
