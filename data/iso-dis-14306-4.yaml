abstract:
- content: "The JT file format specification for 3D visualization specifies the sequential
    order of bytes that comprise the segments of data required to represent a JT file.
    The JT format is uniquely compressed to minimize file size. \nThe JT file format
    specification for 3D visualization includes data descriptions that can represent
    the following data.\n—  facet information (triangles), stored with geometry compression
    techniques; \n—  visual attributes such as lights, textures and materials; \n—
    \ product manufacturing information (PMI); \n—  boundary representation (b-rep)
    solid model shape representation and associated metadata; \n—  configuration representations;
    and\n—  delivery methods such as asynchronous streaming of content.\n\n The following
    geometry representation are proposed to be deprecated in the ISO 14306 Part 4
    specification\n— lightweight ULP geometric boundary representation;\n—  lightweight
    LWPA precise analytic geometric boundary representation;\n\nA complete list of
    Product Manufacturing Information (PMI) String Property Atom Element values will
    be made available as a Reference Data Library in electronic insert format. A number
    of Material and Surface attributes referenced by the ISO 14306-4 specification
    will also be defined in a separate Reference Data Library in electronic insert
    format.\n \nThe JT file format specification for 3D visualization does not specify
    the implementation of, or definition of, any runtime architecture for viewing
    and/or processing JT data."
