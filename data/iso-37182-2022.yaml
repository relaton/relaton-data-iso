abstract:
- content: This document describes criteria to organize smart transportation to save
    fuel in bus transportation services where the reduction of energy consumption
    is intended. Smart transportation aims not only at fuel efficiency, but at pollutant
    emission reduction for engine driven buses, as well as the financial stabilization
    of bus transportation services for citizens and city visitors.
