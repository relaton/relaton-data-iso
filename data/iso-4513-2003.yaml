abstract:
- content: 'ISO 4513:2003 specifies a method for establishing an eyellipse for locating
    driver''s eyes inside a road vehicle for the purpose of measuring the driver''s
    field of view. Elliptical (eyellipse) models in both two and three dimensions
    are used to represent 95th and 99th percentiles of driver eye locations. Its procedures,
    which differ depending on the type of vehicle considered, are applicable to passenger
    cars (and light trucks), and to buses and heavy vehicles, as defined in ISO 3833.
    The statistical representation of the driver''s eye locations it provides can
    be used as a design tool for passenger cars (V-points can be used in lieu of the
    complete eyellipse to standardize the driver''s field of view for regulation purposes). '
