- content: |-
    This document addresses light-duty vehicles, such as passenger cars, pick-up trucks, light vans and sport utility vehicles (motorcycles excluded) equipped with Manoeuvring Aids for Low Speed Operation (MALSO) systems. It specifies the minimum functionality requirements which the driver can generally expect of the device, i.e. detection of and information on the presence of relevant obstacles within a defined (short) detection range. It defines minimum requirements for failure indication as well as performance test procedures; it includes rules for the general information strategy but does not restrict the kind of information or display system.
    MALSO systems use object-detection devices (sensors) for ranging in order to provide the driver with information based on the distance to obstacles. Although sensing technology is not addressed in this document, technology does affect the performance-test procedures set up in Clause 7. The current test objects are defined based on systems using ultrasonic sensors, which reflect the most commonly used technology at the time of publication. For other sensing technologies which will potentially emerge in the future, these test objects shall be checked and changed if required.
    Visibility-enhancement systems like video-camera aids without distance ranging and warning are not covered by this document.
    Reversing aids and obstacle-detection devices on heavy commercial vehicles are not addressed by this document.
