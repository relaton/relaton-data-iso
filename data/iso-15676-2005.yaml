  content: "ISO 15676:2005 specifies requirements for single-use tubing packs for
    cardiopulmonary bypass and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). ISO 15676:2005
    is applicable to all medical tubing intended for cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB)
    and/or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), but specific requirements and
    tests are included for tubing intended for use with peristaltic pumps during (short-term,
    i.e. < 6 h duration) CPB surgery, or (long-term, i.e. > 24 h) ECMO procedures.
    The sterility and non-pyrogenicity provisions of ISO 15676:2005 are applicable
    to tubing packs labelled as \"sterile\". \nISO 15676:2005 is applicable only to
    the tubing aspects for multifunctional systems that may have integral components
    such as blood gas exchangers (oxygenators), reservoirs, blood filters, defoamers,
    blood pumps, etc."
