abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 19795-1:2006 is concerned with the evaluation of biometric systems
    in terms of error rates and throughput rates. Metrics for the various error rates
    in biometric enrolment, verification and identification are unambiguously specified.
    Recommendations and requirements are given for the conduct of performance evaluations
    through the steps of planning the evaluation; collection of enrolment, verification
    or identification transaction data; analysis of error rates; and the reporting
    and presentation of results. The principles presented are generic to the range
    of biometric modalities, applications, and test purposes, and to both offline
    and online testing methodologies. These principles help avoid bias due to inappropriate
    data collection or analytic procedures; give better estimates of field performance
    for the expended effort; and clarify the limits of applicability of the test results.
