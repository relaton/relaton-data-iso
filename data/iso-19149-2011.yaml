  content: "ISO 19149:2011 defines an XML-based vocabulary or language to express
    rights for geographic information in order that digital licenses can be created
    for such information and related services. This language, GeoREL, is an extension
    of the rights expression language in ISO/IEC 21000-5 and is to be used to compose
    digital licenses. Each digital license will unambiguously express those particular
    rights that the owners (or their agent) of a digital geographic resource extend
    to the holders of that license. The digital rights management system in which
    these licenses are used can then offer ex ante (before the fact) protection for
    all such resources.\nNOTE          The proper use of a GeoREL includes the preservation
    of rights access by formula expressed in usage licenses. Thus, data in the public
    or private domain, when protected, remain in their respective domains if the usage
    rights granted so state. \nThese \"rights\" are not always covered by copyright
    law, and are often the result of contracts between individuals that specify the
    proper and allowed uses of resources, as opposed to the threat of copyright litigations
    which is an ex post facto (after the fact) remediation measure, not an ex ante
    protection measure. ISO 19149:2011 is not a reflection of, or extension of, copyright
    law.\nMechanisms for the enforcement and preservation of those contract rights
    are specified in ISO/IEC 21000, and it is not the intention of ISO 19149:2011
    to replace nor redefine those mechanisms, but to use them as previously standardized."
