  content: ISO/PAS 12158 presents methods for measuring the temperature of braking
    systems in road vehicles. It is applicable to both disc and drum brakes fitted
    on passenger cars and commercial vehicles, and its methods are suitable for either
    dynamometer tests in the laboratory or vehicle tests on road and track.
