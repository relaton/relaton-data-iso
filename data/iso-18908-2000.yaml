    This International Standard specifies a method for determining and quantitatively expressing the folding endurance
    of photographic film. The method is based on the MIT folding-endurance tester described in annex B. It is an
    analytical test and is not intended to simulate practical use conditions.
    This International Standard is applicable to film with or without a gelatin backing. It may also be applied to either
    raw or processed film, although the flexibility level of a given film can be quite different after processing.
    Equipment similar to that described in this International Standard may be used provided that a correlation has been
    established between the results obtained using such equipment and the results obtained using the equipment
    described.
