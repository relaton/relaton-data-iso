    ISO 18606:2013 specifies procedures and requirements for packaging that are suitable for organic recycling. Packaging is considered as recoverable by organic recycling only if all the individual components meet the requirements.
    Therefore, packaging is not considered recoverable by organic recycling if only some of the components meet the requirements of ISO 18606:2013. However, if the components can be easily, physically separated before disposal, then the physically separated components can be individually considered for organic recycling.
    ISO 18606:2013 is applicable to organic recycling of used packaging but does not address regulations regarding the recoverability of any residual packaged goods.
    ISO 18606:2013 does not provide information on requirements for the biodegradability of used packaging which ends up in the soil environment as litter, because littering is not considered as a recovery option. It is also not applicable to biological treatment undertaken in small installations by householders.
    For each of the packaging components the following four aspects are addressed:
    - biodegradation;
    - disintegration during biological waste treatment process (i.e. composting);
    - negative effects on the biological process;
    - negative effects on the quality of the resulting compost, including the presence of high levels of regulated metals and other substances hazardous to the environment.
    ISO 18606:2013 establishes the requirements for packaging suitable for organic recycling.
    The procedure for applying ISO 18606:2013 is contained in ISO 18601.
