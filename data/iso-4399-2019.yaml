    This document specifies a selection of nominal pressures for hydraulic and pneumatic fluid power connectors and associated components.
    NOTE       There can be a need to provide a selection of nominal pressures for connectors and associated components used in applications where the external pressure on the components is greater than the internal pressure, for example vacuum service. A document that deals with this subject will be established in due course.
