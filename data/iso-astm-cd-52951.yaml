abstract:
- content: "This document provides the methods, parameter sets and models to develop
    and utilize a data package for a part created using AM technologies (AM part).
    \ This document is scoped to the information requirements associated with workflow
    of the fabrication of an AM part, from design to acceptance.   Peripheral information
    related to entities such as organization, facility, operator, security, and others
    is addressed for sake of completeness; but is not the focus of this document and
    can be defined elsewhere.   This document provides the means to develop an organizational
    or application-specific data package for the communication between and amongst
    the designer, the manufacturer, and all acceptance authorities, among other potential
    stakeholders.  \n\nThis document does not impose a plan of execution to produce
    an AM part, though a digital thread is provided to establish a referenceable information
    workflow. \nThe requirements set forth in this document are based on the fabrication
    of a part using the PBF-LB/M process.  While specific details directly relate
    to PBF-LB/M, generalized workflow requirements can be related to any AM process."
