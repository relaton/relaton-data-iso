    This part of ISO 15534 specifies current requirements for human body measurements (anthropometric data) that are
    required by ISO 15534-1 and ISO 15534-2 for the calculation of access-opening dimensions as applied to machinery.
    The anthropometric data originate from static measurements of nude persons and do not take into account body
    movements, clothing, equipment, machinery-operating conditions or environmental conditions.
    The data are based on information from anthropometric surveys representative of population groups within Europe
    comprising at least three million people. Both men and women are taken into account.
    Measurements are given, as required by ISO 15534-1 and ISO 15534-2, for the 5th, 95th and 99th percentiles of the
    relevant population group within Europe.
