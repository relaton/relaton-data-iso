abstract:
- content: "ISO 18424:2013 addresses the need for a standardized information model
    capable of supporting Telemetry/Telecommand (TM/TC) definitions across the widest
    possible range of space domain activities. The goal is to allow TM/TC definitions
    to be exchanged between different organizations and systems, often at the boundaries
    of mission phases, without the need for customized import/export, re-validation,
    or even re-implementation of mission databases.\nThe scope of ISO 18424:2013 is
    limited to the satellite telemetry and commanding meta-data constructs necessary
    to perform satellite and payload data processing. ISO 18424:2013 includes the
    meta-data needed to:\n- Define the structure and sequence of both CCSDS packets
    and TDM frames;\n- Define the data manipulation required for packaging and unpacking
    of individual data items;\n- Describe command data including command identification,
    argument specification, and validation criteria;\n- Define parameter and command
    encoding;\n- Define data properties including including default values, validity
    criteria, and data dependencies.\nThe scope of ISO 18424:2013 does not extend
    to: \n- Data distribution mechanisms or rules;\n- Command and data protocol specifications;\n-
    RF or analog stream characterization;\n- Data grouping including aggregation and
    coherent data sets;\n- Data representation (visualization properties);\n- Scheduling
    configuration properties;\n- Orbital properties;\n- Displays;\n- Flight Software.\nISO
    18424:2013 addresses only the definition of TM/TC data, but is not a specification
    for the transfer of live or historical TM/TC data. It is a meta-data specification,
    not a data specification."
