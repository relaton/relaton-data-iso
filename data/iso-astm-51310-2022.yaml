- content: 1.1 This is a practice for using a radiochromic optical waveguide dosimetry
    system to measure absorbed dose in materials irradiated by photons and high energy
    electrons in terms of absorbed dose to water. The radiochromic optical waveguide
    dosimetry system is generally used as a routine dosimetry system.1.2 The optical
    waveguide dosimeter is classified as a Type II dosimeter on the basis of the complex
    effect of influence  quantities (see ISO/ASTM Practice 52628).1.3 This document
    is one of a set of standards that provides recommendations for properly implementing
    dosimetry in radiation processing, and describes a means of achieving compliance
    with the requirements of ISO/ASTM 52628 for an optical waveguide dosimetry system.
    It is intended to be read in conjunction with ISO/ASTM Practice 52628.1.4 This
    practice applies to radiochromic optical waveguide dosimeters that can be used
    within part or all of the specified ranges as follows:1.4.1 The absorbed dose
    range is from 1 Gy to 20 000 Gy.1.4.2 The absorbed dose rate is from 0.001 Gy/s
    to 1000 Gy/s.1.4.3 The radiation photon energy range is from 1 MeV to 10 MeV.1.4.4
    The radiation electron energy range is from 3 MeV to 25 MeV.1.4.5 The irradiation
    temperature range is from –78 °C to +60 °C.1.5 The values stated in SI units are
    to be regarded as standard. No other units of measurement are included in this
    standard.1.6 This standard does not purport to address all of the safety concerns,
    if any, associated with its use. It is the responsibility of the user of this
    standard to establish appropriate safety, health, and environmental practices
    and determine the applicability of regulatory limitations prior to use.1.7 This
    international standard was developed in accordance with internationally recognized
    principles on standardization established in the Decision on Principles for the
    Development of International Standards, Guides and Recommendations issued by the
    World Trade Organization Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.
