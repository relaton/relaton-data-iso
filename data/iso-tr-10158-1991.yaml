abstract:
- content: Clause 3 contains explanations of some of the basic terms employed in the
    development and application of the concept of fire resistance. Clause 4 discusses
    the significance of fire resistance. Clause 7 covers the development and application
    of calculation methods which are associated with the results obtained from fire
    resistance tests. Clause 8 gives a survey of the methods presently available for
    structural fire design, followed by an enumeration of the precepts that appear
    to be applicable to their use. Clause 9 deals in more detail with the development
    and application of calculation methods which are directly related to an analytical
    determination of fire resistance.
