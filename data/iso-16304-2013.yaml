    ISO 16304:2013 applies to the management of ship generated waste regulated by MARPOL that is discharged at ports and terminals. It also covers principles and issues that should be considered in the development of a port waste management plan (PWMP), its implementation and port reception facilities (PRF) operations. The operation of any PRF is governed by the principles and procedures included in the PWMP. The procedures to operate the PRF and the development of a PWMP are closely linked and therefore are integrated into ISO 16304:2013.
    ISO 16304:2013 addresses the principles and issues that should be considered in:
    a) The development of a port waste management strategy;
    b) The design and operation of PRFs;
    c) PWMP development, implementation and compliance; and
    d) PRF management and accountability.
    ISO 16304:2013 has been designed to be used by ports of any size and capability. It does not give specifics on the size or location of PRFs in each port, but provides a list of principles to be considered and applied to any size or type of port or terminal (e.g. marina, fishing port, container terminal, oil terminal, roll on/roll off terminal, cruise terminal, ferry terminal, bulk or general cargo terminal, ship repair or recycling facility, and offshore terminal). ISO 16304:2013 can also be used by those ports that have entered regional arrangements for the provision of their PRF, or inland ports and marinas, providing that the definition of waste and its management in the national legislation of the facility are referenced accordingly. Many ports already have systems in place that work efficiently; therefore ISO 16304:2013 can be used by ports with existing PRFs as well as new ports or existing ports developing new PRFs.
