    This document provides RDF mappings of the different MLR entities introduced in the MLR framework (ISO/IEC 19788‑1 and its amendment): data element specifications (DESs), resource classes (RCs), data elements (DEs), application profiles (APs), MLR records and data element group specifications (DEGSs).
    This document associates HTTP IRIs (linguistically neutral and linguistic) to conceptual MLR entities denoted by MLR identifiers. This is needed for the management of MLR entities and their versions.
    Moreover, this document provides excerpts of an OWL 2 DL ontology for the resource classes and data element specifications (properties) introduced in the ISO/IEC 19788 series.
