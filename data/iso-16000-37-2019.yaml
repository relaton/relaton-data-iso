    This document specifies the measurement methods and strategies for determining the PM2,5 mass concentrations of suspended particulate matter (PM) in indoor air. It can also be used for determining PM10 mass concentration.
    The reference method principle consists of collecting PM2,5 on a filter after separation of the particles by an impaction head and weighing them by means of a balance.
    Measurement procedure and main requirements are similar to the conditions specified in EN 12341.
    This document also specifies procedures for operating appropriate supplementary high time resolution instruments, which can be used to highlight peak emission, room investigation and as part of the quality control of the reference method.
    Quality assurance, determination of the measurement uncertainty and minimal reporting information are also part of this document.
    The lower range of application of this document is 2 µg/m3 of PM2,5 (i.e. the limit of detection of the standard measurement method expressed as its uncertainty).
    This document does not cover the determination of bioaerosols or the chemical characterization of particles. For the measurement and assessment of dust composition, see the relevant technical rules in the International Standards in the ISO 16000 series.
    This document does not cover passenger compartments of vehicles and public transport systems.
