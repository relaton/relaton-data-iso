    This document establishes a framework for defining quality models which are composed of quality characteristics and sub-characteristics. In particular, this document provides:
    —     the concept of a quality model;
    —     the structure and semantics of quality models;
    —     the relationship between quality models and the other concepts, including measurement, requirement definition, and evaluation;
    —     guidelines, requirements and examples for using quality models.
