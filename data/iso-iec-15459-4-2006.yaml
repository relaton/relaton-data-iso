abstract:
- content: "Unique identification can occur at many different levels in the supply
    chain, at the transport unit, at the item level, and elsewhere. Such distinct
    entities are often handled by several parties: the sender, the receiver, one or
    more carriers, customs authorities, etc. Each of these parties must be able to
    identify and trace the item so that reference can be made to associated information
    such as configuration, maintenance history, address, order number, contents of
    the item, weight, sender, batch or lot number, etc. \nThe information is often
    held on computer systems, and may be exchanged between parties involved via EDI
    (Electronic Data Interchange) and XML (eXtensible Markup Language) messages.\nThere
    are considerable benefits if the identity of the item is represented in bar code
    format, or other AIDC (Automatic Identification and Data Capture) media and attached
    to or made a constituent part of that which is being uniquely identified so that\n-
    it can be read electronically, thus minimising errors;\n- one identity can be
    used by all parties;\n- each party can use the identity to look up its computer
    files to find the data associated with the item;\n- the identifier is unique within
    the class and cannot appear on any other item of the class during the lifetime
    of the item.\nThe unique identifier for supply chain management defined in ISO/IEC
    15459-4:2006 and represented in a bar code label, two-dimensional symbol, radio-frequency
    identification tag, or other AIDC media attached to the item meets these needs.
    \nAll AIDC technologies have the potential to encode a unique identifier. It is
    expected that application standards for items, using various automatic identification
    technologies, will be developed based upon the unique identifier as a prime key.
    These application standards may be made available from the Issuing Agency.\nISO/IEC
    15459-4:2006 specifies a unique, non-significant string of characters for the
    unique identifier for supply chain management. The character string is intended
    to be represented in a bar code label or other AIDC media attached to the item
    to meet supply chain management needs. To address management needs different classes
    of items are recognized in the various parts of ISO/IEC 15459, which allows different
    requirements to be met by the unique identifiers associated with each class. The
    rules are defined for the unique identifiers for supply chain management to identify
    the unique occurrence of an item, understood to mean the layers zero and one as
    will be defined in two future International Standards (ISO 17367 and ISO 17366,
    respectively)."
