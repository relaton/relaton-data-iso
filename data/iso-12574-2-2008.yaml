    ISO 12574-2:2008 gives the principal responsibilities of the installers of cellulose-fibre loose-fill thermal insulation products for buildings. If a product is manufactured and packaged according to ISO 12574-1 and then installed in ventilated roof spaces as described in ISO 9774, it is expected to provide the properties declared by the manufacturer.
    ISO 12574-2:2008 gives the principal responsibilities of the installer in the installation of the product, in the documentation of the installation and in the declaration that all requirements of this part of ISO 12574 have been met.
    ISO 12574-2:2008 does not specify fitness of the product for the intended use beyond those aspects relating to installation. Many aspects relating to the fitness for use are specified in government regulations. It is necessary that the installer ensure, when installing the product, that the product installed is suitable for the application, based on the government regulations and the manufacturer's recommendations.
    The installer can be required to meet ancillary (additional) requirements that are specified in local regulations or the customer's requirements.
