abstract:
- content: |-
    This document specifies the process assessment model (PAM). It contains process definitions of the ITES-BPO lifecycle defined in ISO/IEC 30105-1 and a model suitable for assessing process capability. The outcomes in the PAM are clearly defined, observable results, aligned to the business benefits derived by the customer and service provider.
    A PAM consists of a set of indicators for process performance and process capability. The indicators are used as a basis for collecting the objective evidence that enables an assessor to determine ratings. The set of indicators included in this document is not intended to be an all-inclusive set, nor is it intended to be applicable in its entirety. Supersets and subsets are selected according to the context and the scope of the assessment.
    The PAM in this document is directed at assessment sponsors and competent assessors who wish to select a model and an associated documented assessment process for the ITES-BPO lifecycle processes, for process capability gap determination.
