    ISO 3008-3:2016 specifies the test method for determining the fire resistance of horizontally oriented door and shutter assemblies which may be exposed to a fire from the underside. It is applicable to all types of door and shutter assemblies installed in a horizontal orientation within floor or roof assemblies requiring fire-resistance ratings in buildings.
    The test method allows for the measurement of integrity and, if required, the measurement of radiation and thermal insulation. In addition, this test method includes measurement of the load-carrying ability of the test specimens subjected to a standard fire-resistance test.
