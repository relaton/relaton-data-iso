    This International Standard specifies the procedure to be applied in analysing the results of speed trials for ships, with reference to the effects which may have an influence upon the speed-power-revolutions relationship.
    The applicability of the International Standard is limited to commercial ships of the displacement type.
    The instrumentation to be used in the speed trials is not specifically indicated, nor is the method of conducting the trials. Calibrated instruments and their methods of use commonly adopted for such trials should be acceptable.
