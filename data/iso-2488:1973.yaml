  script: Latn
  content: The principle of the analysis consists in dissolution of a test portion
    and addition, in a dilute acid medium, of mercuric salts which, with the chloride
    ions, form soluble and only slightly ionized mercury(II) chloride. Indication
    of the completion of the reaction by the appearance of a violet coloration due
    to the reaction between the excess of mercury(II) ions and the diphenylcarbazone
    used as indicator.
