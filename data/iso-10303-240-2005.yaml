    ISO 10303-240:2005 specifies the use of the integrated resources necessary for the scope and information requirements for the exchange, sharing and long term data retention of computer-interpretable process plan information for both numerical control (NC) and manually operated applications and associated product definition data.
    The following are within the scope of ISO 10303-240:2005:
    - information out of the planning activity that is contained in the process plans for machined parts which includes:numerical controlled machines;manual operations.
    - the manufacture of a single piece mechanical part, and assemblies of single piece parts for manufacturing purpose which includes:process data for part routing which includes manufacturing process and setup sequencing;process data for operation.
    - interface for capturing technical data out of the upstream application protocols which includes:product definition data, including tracking a design exception notice of a part;initial material definition data.
    - technical data for and/or out of the process planning for machined pats which includes:machining features for defining shapes necessary for manufacturing;machining feature classification structure;geometric and dimensional tolerances of the parts being manufactured;materials, and properties of the parts being manufactured.references to standards and specifications declared in the process plan;
    - work instructions for the tasks required to manufacture a part, using which include:references to the resources required to perform the work;the sequences of the work instructions;relationships of the work to the part geometry.information required to support NC programming of processes specified in the process plan;shop floor information specified in the process plan;information for production planning specified in the process plan;
