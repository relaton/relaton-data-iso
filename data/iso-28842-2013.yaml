    The purpose of ISO 28842:2013 is to provide sufficient information to perform the design of the structural concrete bridge that complies with the limitations established in ISO 28842:2013. The rules of design as set forth in ISO 28842:2013 are simplifications of more elaborate requirements.
    ISO 28842:2013 can be used as an alternative to the development of a national concrete bridge design and construction code, or equivalent document in countries where no national design codes are available by themselves, or as an alternative to the national concrete bridge design and construction code in countries where specifically considered and accepted by the national standards body or other appropriate regulatory organization, and applies to the planning, design and construction of structural concrete bridges to be used in new bridges of restricted span length, height of piers, and type.
