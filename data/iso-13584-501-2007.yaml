  content: "ISO 13584-501:2007 specifies the requirements for an ISO-registered reference
    dictionary for measuring instruments with their properties and domains of values.
    ISO 13584-501:2007 also establishes and specifies the behaviour of a registration
    authority whose role is to develop, maintain and update this ISO-registered reference
    dictionary for measuring instruments. These measuring instruments include environment
    measuring instruments and laboratory measuring instruments. \nThe reference dictionaries
    series of parts of ISO 13584 specifies ontologies for representing the entities
    of an application domain, together with their descriptive properties and domains
    of values. Each entity, property or domain of values constitutes an entry of a
    dictionary that constitutes the formal and computer sensible representation of
    the specified ontology. It is associated with a computer sensible and human readable
    definition and with a computer sensible identification. \nThe unique identification
    of a dictionary entry allows it to be referenced unambiguously from any application.
    Definitions and identifications of dictionary entries consist of instances of
    the EXPRESS entity data types defined in the common dictionary schema, or in its
    extensions defined in the logical series of parts of ISO 13584."
