  content: "ISO 29282:2011 provides definitions and procedures for the establishment,
    maintenance and termination of an ITS (intelligent transport systems) communications
    session within a CALM (communication access for land mobiles) system environment
    using bi-directional satellite communications. \nIt defines the operation of the
    medium management adaptation entity (MMAE), which provides the management interface
    between a proprietary satellite communications medium and the \"ITS station management\".
    This enables the \"ITS station management\" to know the status of the communications
    medium and control the interface without the need for applications at the ITS
    station to have any knowledge of the satellite communications interface. The procedures
    that the \"ITS station management\" expects to use are also explained.\nISO 29282:2011
    defines how to connect and disconnect a communication session using satellite
    communication systems in the context of an application operated within the environment
    defined in ISO 21217. It supports peer-to-peer modes of communication. Support
    for broadcast satellite systems is defined in ISO 13183, which provides a common
    approach for all broadcast media. It supports satellite communications networks
    that are interconnected with the public network, as well as those which connect
    via the internet and those which provide a stand-alone capability. "
