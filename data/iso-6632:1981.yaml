  content: The method consists in acidifying a test portion with tartaric acid, entraining
    the volatile acids by steam distillation and titrating the distillate with standard
    volumetric sodium hydroxide solution in the presence of phenolphthalein as an

    without chemical preservatives, and to products to which sulphur dioxide has been
    added.
