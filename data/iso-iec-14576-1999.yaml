  content: "This International Standard specifies the logical specifications of STbus
    which is a highperformance and highly reliable system bus. STbus adopts a synchronous
    transfer method with a high-speed clock and a split transfer method enabling to
    minimize bus holding time during one bus operation and to use a bus efficiently.\nThe
    contents given in this specifications are as follows:\na) System bus interface
    signal provisions;\nb) Bus operations and transfer protocol for each bus operation;
    \nc) Copyback cache coherency control for maintaining consistency between a shared
    memory and a cache memory of each processor in a multiprocessor system;\nd) Fault
    detection function using parity check and duplex configuration for control signals."
