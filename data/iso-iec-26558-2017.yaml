    ISO/IEC 26558:2017, within the context of methods and tools for supporting explicit and/or separate variability modelling, variability model management and variability model support in software and systems product lines:
    -      provides the terms and definitions specific to variability modelling for software and systems product line;
    -      defines processes for variability modelling, variability model management and variability model support throughout the product line lifecycle. Those processes are described in terms of purpose, inputs, tasks and outcomes;
    -      defines method capabilities to support the defined tasks of each process;
    -      defines tool capabilities that automate or semi-automate tasks and methods.
    ISO/IEC 26558:2017 does not concern processes and capabilities of tools and methods for a single system but rather deals with those for a family of products.
