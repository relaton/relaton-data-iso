  content: "ISO/ASTM 51275:2013 is a practice for using radiochromic film dosimetry
    systems to measure absorbed dose in materials irradiated by photons or electrons
    in terms of absorbed dose to water.\nRadiochromic film dosimetry systems are generally
    used as routine dosimetry systems.\nThe radiochromic film dosimeter is classified
    as a Type II dosimeter on the basis of the complex effect of influence quantities.
    \nISO/ASTM 51275:2013 is one of a set of standards that provides recommendations
    for properly implementing dosimetry in radiation processing, and describes a means
    of achieving compliance with the requirements of ASTM E2628 for a radiochromic
    film dosimetry system. It is intended to be read in conjunction with ASTM E2628."
