    ISO 12648:2006 provides safety requirements for the design and construction of machines used in printing press systems, including auxiliary equipment and finishing machines, in which all the machine actuators (e.g. drives) of the equipment in the system are controlled by the same control system.
    It is applicable only to systems in which a printing press is part of the system.
    It addresses recognized hazards specific to printing press systems in the following areas:
    - mechanical;
    - electrical;
    - slipping, tripping, falling;
    - ergonomics;
    - noise;
    - radiation;
    - fire and explosion;
    - thermal;
    - emissions.
    Equipment covered by ISO 12648:2006 may be used in a stand-alone configuration, or in combination with other machines affected by an integrated control system.
    This International Standard applies to machines manufactured one year or more after the date of its publication.
