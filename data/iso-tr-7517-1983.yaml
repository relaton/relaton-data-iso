  content: This Technical Report describes the principal drum tests used to asses
    the physical strength of coke. These tests involve rotation of the coke in drums
    of different dimensions for different durations, and lead to the production of
    different indices. Additionally the available experimental evidence relating the
    various strength indices has been consulted. Such evidence relates the principal
    as well as secondary indices. In this Technical report, all available statistical
    relationships between the principal strength indices have been listed and where
    possible illustrated graphically.
