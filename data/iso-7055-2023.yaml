    This document specifies a method for the determination of drag reduction of slick water, which is mainly used to evaluate the drag reduction performance of slick water.
    This document uses the pipeline method to evaluate the drag reduction, which is currently recognized as the best method to evaluate the drag reduction performance.
    This document describes the device, experimental conditions and operating steps in detail. The drag reduction value obtained by evaluation according to this document can effectively represent the on-site drag reduction performance.
