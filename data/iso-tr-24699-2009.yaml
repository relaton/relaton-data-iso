abstract:
- content: |-
    ISO/TR 24699:2009 provides guidelines for inclusion of environmental aspects in standards for rubber and rubber products. It proposes an approach which is directed at minimizing any adverse environmental impact of the products under consideration without detracting from the primary purpose of ensuring their adequate fitness for use. It closely follows the guidelines laid down in ISO 17422, with certain modifications to make it applicable to rubber and rubber products.
    The guidance provided by ISO/TR 24699 is intended primarily for use by standards writers. Over and above its primary purpose, however, ISO/TR 24699 provides guidance of value to those involved in design work and other activities where the environmental aspects of rubber and rubber products are being considered. It promotes the use of renewable, recycled and recyclable materials when environmentally beneficial and includes guidance on compliance with legislation concerning the end-of-life treatment of rubber products and the management of restricted and prohibited substances.
