  content: Specifies general and dimensional requirements for the design and performance
    of O-ring face seal fittings of steel for tube outside diameters or hose inside
    diameters of 6 mm to 38 mm, inclusive. These fittings are for use in fluid power
    and general applications where elastomeric seals can be used to prevent fluid
    leakage. They are intended for the connection of tubes and hose fittings to ports
    in accordance with ISO 6149-1.
