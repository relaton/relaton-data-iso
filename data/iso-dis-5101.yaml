    This document specifies expected field loads for functions provided by the braking system actuator and modulator and applies to passenger cars and light commercial vehicles (classes M1 and N1, according to UNECE).
    Functions addressed in this document are:
    —    dynamic stability functions (e.g. electronic stability control);
    —    brake torque optimizing functions (e.g. electronic brake force distribution);
    —    brake assistance functions (e.g. hill start assist).
    This document only covers functions where data of appropriate maturity are available. There are additional functions of a braking system, which are not covered by this document.
    By describing the expected field loads, this document specifies representative manoeuvres and occurrences for different functions. These serve as an orientation for the derivation of test procedures.
    This document applies to vehicles up to conditional automation (SAE J 3016 level 3) with a maximum of 30 % automated brake operations.
    NOTE      Field loads for automation levels above level 3 are under consideration for future editions.
