abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: ISO/IEC TR 24741:2018 describes the history of biometrics and what biometrics
    does, the various biometric technologies in general use today (for example, fingerprint
    recognition and face recognition) and the architecture of the systems and the
    system processes that allow automated recognition using those technologies. It
    also provides information about the application of biometrics in various business
    domains such as border management, law enforcement and driver licensing, the societal
    and jurisdiction considerations that are typically taken into account in biometric
    systems, and the international standards that underpin their use.
