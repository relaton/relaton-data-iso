    ISO 22196:2007 specifies a method of evaluating the antibacterial activity of antibacterial-treated plastic products (including intermediate products).
    It is not intended to be used to evaluate the effects and propagation of bacteria on plastics without antibacterial treatments. ISO 846 describes tests to evaluate the effects and propagation of bacteria on plastics, which are different from those covered by ISO 22196.
    Secondary effects of antibacterial treatments, such as the prevention of biodeterioration and odour, are not covered by the standard, which is not intended to be used or referenced as a method to document or claim biodegradability of plastics.
    The standard does not concern plastic building materials, such as PVC or composites, unless they act in the same way as treated articles.
