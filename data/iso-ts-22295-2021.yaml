abstract:
- content: |-
    The document considers peculiarities of the space environment impact on a special kind of materials: nanostructured materials (i.e. materials with structured objects which size in at least one dimension lies within 1 nm to 100 nm) and specifies the methods of mathematical simulation of such processes. It emphasizes the necessity of applying multiscale simulation approach and does not include any special details concerning concrete materials, elements of spacecraft construction and equipment, etc.
    This document provides the general description of the methodology of applying computer simulation methods which relate to different space and time scales to modelling processes occurring in nanostructured materials under the space environment impact.
    The document can be applied as a reference document in spacecraft designing, forecasting the spacecraft lifetime, conducting ground-based tests, and analysing changes of material properties during operation.
