- content: |-
    This document gives methods of determination of duration of load and creep factors under bending actions at ambient temperatures for a defined population of structural timber products such as solid timber, LVL, OSB, plywood, particleboard, I-beams calculated from test values.
    It presents methods for
    a)       determining the duration of load and creep factors for new timber products,
    b)       establishing whether a previously defined set of duration of load and creep factors can be applied to a tested product, and
    c)        an optional method for establishment of sensitivity of duration of load and creep factors to changes in environmental conditions.
    NOTE 1        This document is intended to apply to wood-based products for which a duration of load factor or a creep factor is used in design.
    NOTE 2        The effect of elevated temperature on the duration of load factor and creep factor that is derived using these methods for use with timber products can need additional consideration.
