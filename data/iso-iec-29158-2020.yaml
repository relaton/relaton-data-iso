abstract:
- content: |-
    This document is an engineering document intended for verifier manufacturers and application specification developers.
    This document describes modifications to the symbol quality methodology defined in ISO/IEC 15415 and a symbology specification. It defines alternative illumination conditions, some new terms and parameters, modifications to the measurement and subsequent grading of certain parameters and the reporting of the grading results.
    This document was developed to assess the symbol quality of direct marked parts, where the mark is applied directly to the surface of the item and the reading device is a two-dimensional imager.
    When application specifications allow, this method is also potentially applicable to symbols produced by other methods. This is appropriate when direct part marked (DPM) symbols and non-DPM symbols are being scanned in the same scanning environment. The symbol grade is reported as a DPM grade rather than as an ISO/IEC 15415 grade.
