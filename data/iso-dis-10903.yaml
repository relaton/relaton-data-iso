abstract:
- content: |-
    This standard provides guidelines for the selection and implementation of pipeline geohazards monitoring methods and strategies. It provides processes and principles applicable to various practical monitoring measures. Moreover, it describes the methods and procedures to be implemented and provides guidance for determining the:
    —type, significance grade and frequency of monitoring;
    —recommended monitoring objects and appropriate monitoring systems and methods;
    —components of the monitoring system;
    —threshold alarms, early warning level, criteria and response measures;
    —requirements of the early warning information system.

    This standard applies to onshore gathering and transmission pipelines used in the petroleum and natural gas industries.
