  content: "ISO 8820-3:2010 specifies fuse-links with tabs (blade-type) Type C (medium),
    Type E (high current) and Type F (miniature) for use in road vehicles. It establishes,
    for these fuse-link types, the rated current, test procedures, performance requirements
    and dimensions. \nISO 8820-3:2010 is applicable for fuse-links with a rated voltage
    of 32 V or 58 V, a current rating of less than or equal to 100 A and a breaking
    capacity of 1 000 A intended for use in road vehicles. \nISO 8820-3:2010 is intended
    to be used in conjunction with ISO 8820-1 and ISO 8820-2. The numbering of its
    clauses corresponds to that of ISO 8820-1, whose requirements are applicable,
    except where modified by requirements particular to ISO 8820-3:2010."
