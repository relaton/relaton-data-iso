  content: "ISO/TS 17574:2009 provides a guideline for preparation and evaluation
    of security requirements specifications, referred to as Protection Profiles (PP)
    in the ISO/IEC 15408 series and in ISO/IEC TR 15446. By a Protection Profile (PP)
    is meant a set of security requirements for a category of products or systems
    that meet specific needs. A typical example would be a PP for On-Board Equipment
    (OBEs) to be used in an EFC system.\nISO/TS 17574:2009 should be read in conjunction
    with the underlying standards ISO/IEC 15408 and ISO/IEC TR 15446. Although a layman
    could read the first part of the document to have an overview on how to prepare
    a Protection Profile for EFC equipment, the annexes, in particular A.4 and A.5,
    require that the reader be familiar with ISO/IEC 15408. The document uses an OBE
    with an integrated circuit(s) card (ICC) as an example to describe both the structure
    of the PP as well as the proposed content. "
