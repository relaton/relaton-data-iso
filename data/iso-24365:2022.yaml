- content: |-
    This document defines procedures for determining the standard thermal outputs and other characteristics of radiators and convectors installed in a permanent manner in construction works, fed with water or steam at temperatures below 120 °C, supplied by a remote energy source.
    This document specifies the laboratory arrangements and testing methods to be adopted, the admissible tolerances, the criteria for selecting the samples to be tested and for verifying the conformity of the current production with the samples tested at the initial test.
    This document also defines the additional common data that the manufacturer shall provide with the product in order to ensure the correct application of the products.
    This document does not apply to fan-assisted radiators, fan-assisted convectors and trench convectors or to independent heating appliances.
