abstract:
- content: The method is based on preparation of a suspension of flour in water, followed
    by recording of the viscosity of the suspension which is heated at a constant
    rate from 30 °C to the temperature corresponding to the moment at which viscosity
    starts to decrease, having reached its maximum (approximately 95 °C). Applies
    to wheat and rye flour and also to wheat and rye grain.
