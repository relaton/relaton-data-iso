abstract:
- content: Specifies the geometrical tests for these woodworking planing machines,
    and gives the corresponding permissible deviations which apply to machines for
    general purpose use and normal accuracy. Gives also the terminologie appropriate
    to each part of the machine (in English and French as well as the equivalent terms
    in German, Spanish, Italian and Swedish). It deals only with the verification
    off accuracy of the machine. It does not apply to the testing of the running of
    the machine, nor to machine characteristcs which should generally be checked before
    the accuracy is tested. Does not impose any practical test.
