    This document specifies test methods for civil electric multi-copter unmanned aircraft systems (UAS). This document is intended to be a general standard for testing the overall UAS functionality with the support of subsystems.
    It is applicable to the category of civil electric multi-copter UAS with maximum take-off mass (MTOM) level I to level V according to ISO 21895. The configuration control and subsystem (e.g. energy system and flight control system tests) test methods are out of the scope of this document. In addition, test methods for operations in snow and icing conditions are not included either, manufacturers have procedures identified to cope with flight in those conditions.
