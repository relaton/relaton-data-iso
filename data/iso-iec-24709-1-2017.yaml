  script: Latn
  content: |-
    ISO/IEC 24709-1:2017 specifies the concepts, framework, test methods, and criteria required to test conformity of biometric products claiming conformance to BioAPI (see ISO/IEC 19784-1). Guidelines for specifying BioAPI conformance test suites, writing test assertions, and defining procedures to be followed during the conformance testing are provided.
    ISO/IEC 24709-1:2017 is concerned with conformance testing of biometric products claiming conformance to BioAPI (see ISO/IEC 19784-1). It is not concerned with testing other characteristics of biometric products or other types of testing of biometric products (i.e. acceptance, performance, robustness, security, etc.) Testing by means of test methods, which are specific to particular biometric products, are not the subject of ISO/IEC 24709-1:2017.
    ISO/IEC 24709-1:2017 is applicable to the development and use of conformance test method specifications, BioAPI conformance test suites, and conformance testing programs for BioAPI-conformant products. It is intended primarily for use by testing organizations, but can be applied by developers and users of test assertions and test method implementations.
