  content: "This document describes a recommended method for the interpolation of
    particle concentration and filter Beta Ratio data when results are not otherwise
    available at the desired particle sizes. It is applicable for assessing conformance
    with existing fluid cleanliness and filter Beta Ratio specifications whereby the
    specification and actual test results are provided in different units of particle
    size, for example, the specification is in µm(c), but the particle counts or Beta
    Ratio data are in units of µm(b). \nThis document is also applicable when particle
    sizes in specifications and available data use the same units of particle size,
    but do not correspond to exactly the same sizes, for example, when particle counts
    at 20 µm(c) are specified, but data was collected at 21 µm(c). This method allows
    interpolation to intermediate particle sizes within the range of existing data
    and does not permit extrapolation to particle sizes outside the range of available
    data."
