abstract:
- content: "The VMEbus specification defines an interfacing system used to interconnect
    microprocessors, data storage, and peripheral control devices in a closely coupled
    hardware configuration. The system has been conceived with the following objectives:
    \na) to allow communication between devices on the VMEbus without disturbing the
    internal activities of other devices interfaced to the VMEbus;\nb) to specify
    the electrical and mechanical system characteristics required to design devices
    that will reliably and unambiguously communicate with other devices interfaced
    to the VMEbus;\nc) to specify protocols that precisely define the interaction
    between the VMEbus and devices interfaced to it; \nd) to provide terminology and
    definitions that describe the system protocol; \ne) to allow a broad range of
    design latitude so that the designer can optimize cost and/or performance without
    affecting system compatibility;\nf) to provide a system where performance is primarily
    device limited, rather than system interface limited."
