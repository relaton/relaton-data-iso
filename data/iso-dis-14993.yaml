    This document specifies the apparatus and test procedure to be used in conducting accelerated corrosion tests for the comparative evaluation of metallic materials with or without permanent corrosion protection or temporary corrosion protection in salt-contaminated outdoor environments. The test involves cyclic exposure of the specimens to neutral salt mist, "dry" and "wet" conditions. The type of test specimen and the exposure period are not specified.
    The particular advantages of this test over common accelerated tests such as the neutral salt spray (NSS) test lie in its ability to better reproduce the corrosion that occurs in outdoor salt-contaminated environments.
    This document is applicable to
    — metals and their alloys,
    — metallic coatings (anodic and cathodic),
    — conversion coatings,
    — anodic oxide coatings, and
    — organic coatings on metallic materials.
    NOTE Methods of test for coatings to determine their resistance, in the presence of scribe marks through to the substrate, to various cyclic corrosion conditions which include the condensation of water on the test specimens during periods of humidity are given in ISO 11997-1.
