abstract:
- content: |-
    ISO/IEC 29110-3-3:2016 contains the requirements for certification bodies performing conformity assessments, of the requirements contained in VSE profile specifications (e.g. ISO/IEC 29110‑4-1 for VSE software basic profile), using process assessments and maturity models. This document is based on published ISO/IEC standards and guides for
    a)    certification bodies (see ISO/IEC 17065)
    b)    the process assessment and organizational process maturity performed according to the requirements of the ISO/IEC 33001 to ISO/IEC 33099 family of process assessment standards, and
    c)    based on ISO/IEC 29169 to support an environment which encourages worldwide recognition of VSE profiles conformity assessment results.
    The overall framework for conformity assessment follows the approach defined in ISO/IEC 17065:2012.
    This document has been developed following practical use and in consultation with key stakeholders, national accreditation bodies, and ISO's policy committee for conformity assessment (CASCO).
    ISO/IEC 29110-3-3:2016 is addressed to people and certification bodies who have a direct relationship with the assessment process based on the VSE profiles.
    It is intended that ISO/IEC/TR 29110‑1, ISO/IEC 29110‑2-1 and ISO/IEC 29110‑4-1 (containing VSE profile specifications) be read first when investigating the possibility of conducting VSE profile certification.
    NOTE          Any clause with requirements directly copied from other standards has those copied requirements marked up in a box. Other requirements which are also copied but for which information is added are not marked up in a box but their source is clearly referenced in the text.
