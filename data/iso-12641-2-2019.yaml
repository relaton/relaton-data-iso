    This document defines a framework for advanced reflective and transmissive layouts and colorimetric values of targets for use in the calibration and characterization of image capturing devices.
    This document defines a framework for target creation and data reporting. This framework can be used for both ISO defined and custom targets for both reflective and transmissive use.
    Self-emissive targets are not covered by this document.
