    1.1 This International Standard specifies a general method for determining the resistance to abrasive wear of plastics under the action of abrasive wheels. It is equally applicable to moulded test  specimens, components
    and finished products.
    1.2 The particular test conditions and the method of expressing the results may differ according to the type of material. The test conditions and specific method are specified in the relevant standards for each material or product.
    This method is not applicable to cellular materials or paints.
