- content: |-
    This document specifies the nominal sizes and aim dimensions, with their cutting tolerances, of black-and-white and colour silver halide containing photographic papers in sheets for pictorial use.
    It also specifies a method for checking the squareness of the sheets and straightness of their edges and establishes a rule for package marking.
    The term "pictorial" means the use in the production of Photographic Prints and therefore excludes products for graphic arts.
    In ISO Standards, metric units are prime. However, some older inch sizes are included to add historic context.
