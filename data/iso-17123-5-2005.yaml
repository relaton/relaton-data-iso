abstract:
- content: "ISO 17123-5:2005 specifies field procedures to be adopted when determining
    and evaluating the precision (repeatability) of electronic tacheometers (total
    stations) and their ancillary equipment when used in building and surveying measurements.
    Primarily, these tests are intended to be field verifications of the suitability
    of a particular instrument for the immediate task at hand and to satisfy the requirements
    of other standards. They are not proposed as tests for acceptance or performance
    evaluations that are more comprehensive in nature. \nISO 17123-5:2005 can be thought
    of as one of the first steps in the process of evaluating the uncertainty of measurements
    (more specifically of measurands). The uncertainty of a result of a measurement
    is dependent on a number of factors. These include among others: repeatability,
    reproducibility (between-day repeatability) and a thorough assessment of all possible
    error sources, as prescribed by the ISO Guide to the expression of uncertainty
    in measurement (GUM).\nThese field procedures have been developed specifically
    for in situ applications without the need for special ancillary equipment and
    are purposely designed to minimize atmospheric influences."
