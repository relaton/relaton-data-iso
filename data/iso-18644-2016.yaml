    ISO 18644:2016 specifies the requirements for testing methods, sampling and preparation of test sample, marking and labelling, as well as package, transport, and storage of controlled-release fertilizer.
    ISO 18644:2016 is applicable to controlled-release products having one or more primary fertilizer nutrient (nitrogen and/or phosphorous and/or potassium) in a controlled-release form. They can be made by bulk blending (BB) fertilizers or by special processes.
