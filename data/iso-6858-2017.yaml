- content: |-
    ISO 6858:2017 specifies the electrical output characteristics and interface requirements between an aircraft and ground support electrical supplies. This includes all external electric power generation facilities, provided as part of a central source or in point-of-use application. Requirements for safety features are also included. Performance and safety issues under regional control are not addressed in this document. Requirements for ground traffic control purposes, such as towing points, identification and warning lights, etc. are also excluded.
    The electrical characteristics relate to nominal 28 V DC and either 115/200 V or 230/400 V three-phase, 400 Hz AC outputs measured at the aircraft attaching connector as indicated in Figure 1.
