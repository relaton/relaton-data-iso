abstract:
- content: The results obtained by this method will include the methanol freed from
    combined forms. These are however not usually present at higher levels to effect
    the results. The principle consists in esterfication of the methanol present with
    formic acid using sulphuric acid as a catalyst. Distillation of the methyl formate
    into sodium hydroxide solution and back-titration of the excess sodium hydroxide
    with a standard volumetric sulphuric acid solution, using phenolphthalein as indicator.
    This method is intended for methanol contents greater than 0,2 %.
