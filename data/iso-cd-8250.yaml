  content: "This document specifies requirements to \n•\tensure the required cleanliness
    of medical devices in their delivery state;\n•\tensure the cleanliness of a medical
    device which is required for the execution of manufacturing processes.\nNOTE 1\tThere
    are usually many steps within the manufac¬turing process which are necessary to
    produce a safe medical device. For some of these steps a defined cleanliness of
    the medical device is required. \nProcesses which are carried out after opening
    the original packaging of the medical device are not covered by this document.\nThis
    document does not address the technical implementation of suitable manufacturing
    and cleaning processes.\nThis document is not applicable to medical devices or
    components of medical devices which are located in an area away from the application
    at the patient and which have no contact to patients.\nIf it can be demonstrated
    within a risk analysis that a medical device poses no risk to the patient or the
    user with respect to its cleanliness (e. g. monitors without user panels or surgical
    lights without corresponding handles), the further requirements of this document
    are not applicable to these devices.\nThis document is not applicable to medical
    devices that are composed of substances or of combina-tions of substances that
    are intended to be intro-duced into the human body via a body orifice or applied
    to the skin and that are absorbed by or locally dispersed in the human body.\nNOTE
    2\tThe devices addressed in the paragraph above are so-called “substance-based
    medical devices”, as for example devices in tablet form to moisten the pharyngeal
    mucosa.\nThis document is not applicable to medical devices which contain or incorporate
    tissues or cells, or their derivates, of plantal, animal or human origin.\nIn
    addition, this document is not applicable to the following medical devices:\n•\tequipment
    (e.g. sterilizers and washers/washer-disinfectors);\n•\tliquid or gaseous medical
    devices;\n•\tabsorbable medical devices;\nsoftware."
