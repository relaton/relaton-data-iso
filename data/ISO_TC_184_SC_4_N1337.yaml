  content: |-
    The purpose of this standing document is to specify changes to the application
    protocol (AP) development procedures due to application modularization.
    This standing document consists of an activity model in IDEF0 that documents
    the AP and application module (AM) development process. The activity model
    emphasizes links to AM development within the AP development process.
    Guidelines for the content of AMs and guidelines for the content of APs composed
    of AMs are provided in other standing documents. This document does not cover
    the review and approval cycles that are part of the AP and AM development process.
