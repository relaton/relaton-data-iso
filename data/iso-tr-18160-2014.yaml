    ISO/TR 18160:2014 recommends test methods for evaluating the consistency of the digital images recorded onto black and white silver microfilm using input from both digitally born documents as well as digital documents created from document scanners. Quality control procedures to be used for optimizing and maintaining output quality onto film over time are described. ISO/TR 18160:2014 stresses the use of both commercial and ISO approved standard test targets.
    The test methods are based on the visual examination of the output of office document scanners and digitally born test targets on film image recorders.
    It is applicable to assessing the output quality of document scanners used in the office and film image recorders used to record the resultant scanned images to microfilm. Microforms can be any common formats including 16 mm, 35 mm, and 105 mm roll microfilm, as well as microfiche depending on the film image recorder capability.
