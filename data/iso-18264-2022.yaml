- content: |-
    This document specifies the requirements related to safety, including methods of rating and testing sling constructions made from fibre ropes. It is applicable to ropes made of high modulus polyethylene (HMPE) fibre having a minimum reference number of 12 and a maximum reference number of 72.
    The fibre rope slings covered by this document are intended for general-purpose lifting operations only, i.e. when used for lifting objects, materials or goods which require no deviations from the requirements, design factors, or work load limits specified.
    This document does not cover slings used for the lifting of persons, potentially dangerous materials such as molten metal and acids, glass sheets, fissile materials, nuclear reactors and special (non-routine and engineered) lifting operations. This document can be used as a reference for lifting slings made with HMPE fibres to be used in special lifting operations.
