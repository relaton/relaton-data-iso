  content: ISO 15270:2006 provides guidance for the development of standards and specifications
    covering plastics recovery as well as other means of plastics waste reduction,
    including recycling. The standard establishes the different options for the recovery
    of plastics arising from pre-consumer and post-consumer sources. It also establishes
    the quality requirements that should be considered in all steps of the recovery
    process, and provides general recommendations for inclusion in material standards,
    test standards and product specifications. Consequently, the process stages, requirements,
    recommendations and terminology presented in the standard are intended to be of
    general applicability.
