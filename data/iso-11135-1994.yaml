abstract:
- content: Establishes requirements and guidance. Particular attention is drawn to
    the need for specific testing for safety, quality and efficacy, possibly exceeding
    the general requirements, which may be necessary for a specific product. Attention
    is drawn to the existence in some countries of regulations laying down safety
    requirements for handling ethylene oxide and for premises in which it is used
    as well as of regulations laying down limits for the level of ethylene oxide residues
    within medical devices and products.
