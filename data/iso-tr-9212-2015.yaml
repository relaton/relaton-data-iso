    ISO/TR 9212:2015 reviews the current status of direct and indirect bedload-measurement techniques. The methods are mainly based on grain size distribution of the bedload, channel width, depth, and velocity of flow. This Technical Report outlines and explains several methods for direct and indirect measurement of bedload in streams, including various types of sampling devices.
    The purposes of measuring bedload-transport rates are to
    a)   increase the accuracy of estimating total sediment load in rivers and deposition in reservoirs,
    b)   gain knowledge of bedload transport that cannot be completely measured by conventional suspended-sediment collection methods,
    c)   provide data to calibrate or verify theoretical transport models, and
    d)   provide information needed in the design of river diversion and entrainment structures.
    NOTE          The units of measurement used in this Technical Report are SI units.
