abstract:
- content: "ISO 22742:2005 specifies the minimum requirements for the design of labels
    containing a linear bar code and two-dimensional symbols on product packages to
    convey data between trading partners; provides guidance for the formatting on
    the label of data presented in a linear bar code, two-dimensional symbols or human-readable
    form; provides specific recommendations regarding the choice of linear bar code
    and 2D symbologies; specifies quality requirements and classes of bar code density,
    provides specific recommendations regarding 2D symbologies, which allow a broad
    choice for general use of scanning hardware (e.g. area imagers, linear imagers,
    single-line laser scanners, and rastering laser scanners); and makes recommendations
    as to label placement, size and the inclusion of free text and any appropriate
    graphics.\nIt supports item identification and supply chain processes, at the
    product package level, such as inventory control, picking, and point of use. \nThe
    purpose of ISO 22742:2005 is to establish the machine-readable (e.g. bar code)
    and human-readable data content of labels applied to product packages."
