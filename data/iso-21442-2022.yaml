    This document deals with control systems developed as part of a space project. It is applicable to all the elements of a space control system, including the space segment, the ground segment and the launch service segment.
    This document establishes general principles for all technical activities of space control engineering, including control engineering management, requirements definition, analysis, design, production, verification and validation, operation, maintenance, and disposal. It also provides requirements to progressively refine and manage control system realizations in space systems including multiple control systems.
    The requirements of this document can be tailored for each specific space program application.
