abstract:
- content: |-
    ISO/TR 28380-3:2014 describes the general methodology to analyse interoperability requirements in support of a use case to produce the selection and combination of the relevant Profiles specified in TR 28380-2. It is illustrated by applying this methodology to a small number of examples. It also identifies and proposes a high-level quantification of the benefits gained by the use of a profile based specification of interoperability. Finally this technical report will discuss the approach to effectively test interoperability from the specific of the standards and profiles, up to the level of business use cases.
    ISO/TR 28380‑1 is a companion to this part of ISO/TR 28380-3:2014. A wide portfolio of such profiles for Integration, Security, and Semantic Content is now available across various domains of healthcare clinical specialities and technologies, as described in ISO/TR 28380‑2.
    The reader of ISO/TR 28380-3:2014 is encouraged to be familiar with this process followed by IHE in developing its Profiles as it builds upon ISO/TR 28380‑1 and ISO/TR 28380‑2 by addressing a number of key issues to support eHealth projects across all sectors of health to more effectively deploy standards-based interoperability between software applications and devices, including within healthcare organizations and across healthcare and home settings.
