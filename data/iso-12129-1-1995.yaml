  content: Specifies a system of fits applicable to metallic plain bearings used in
    general engineering. Not applicable to half-bearings and bushes which are not
    measured by diameter but by wall thickness, and which are dimensionally changed
    by assembly. Applicable preferably to rotating machine parts and shafting, but
    it may be used similarly in other ranges of application.
