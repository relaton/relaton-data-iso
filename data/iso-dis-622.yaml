abstract:
- content: ISO 622:2016 specifies a reduced molybdophosphate photometric method for
    the determination of the total phosphorus content of hard coal, lignites and coke.
    Two methods for taking the phosphorus into solution are specified, namely extraction
    from the coal or coke ash with acid or by repeated oxidation of the coal or coke,
    by acid, to remove carbonaceous matter.
