    ISO 11712:2009 provides the essential requirements for the design of supralaryngeal airways and connectors. These devices are intended to open and seal the supralaryngeal area to provide an unobstructed airway in patients during spontaneous, assisted or controlled ventilation.
    ISO 11712:2009 specifies the dimensions, basic properties and method of size designation of the available types of supralaryngeal airways. Airways devised for specialized applications are not specifically covered, although most may be classified by the sizing and dimensions (or other characteristics) required by this International Standard.
    ISO 11712:2009 requires dimensional disclosure so the operator will know which auxiliary instruments, such as tracheal tubes and bronchoscopes will be size-compatible.
