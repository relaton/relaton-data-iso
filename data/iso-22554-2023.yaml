    This document specifies the construction, performance requirements, methods of testing, and required test results for electric and electronic propeller shaft revolution indicators (hereinafter referred to as “indicator system”). The requirements in this document are based on those contained in the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) 1974 (as amended, 2000), Clause 2.5.4, Regulation 19, chapter V.
    This document is intended to be used in conjunction with IMO Resolution A.694 (17) and IEC 60945.
    NOTE            A propeller shaft revolution indicator can be designed so that it also complies with the requirements for a tachometer for the engine of a ship.
