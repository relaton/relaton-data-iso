abstract:
- content: "The Open-edi Reference Model (ISO/IEC 14662:2010, Clause 4) states:\n\"The
    intention is that the sending, by an Open-edi Party, of information from a scenario,
    conforming to Open-edi standards, shall allow the acceptance and processing of
    that information in the context of that scenario by one or more Open-edi Parties
    by reference to the scenario and without the need for agreement. However, the
    legal requirements and/or liabilities resulting from the engagement of an organization
    in any Open-edi transaction may be conditioned by the competent legal environment(s)
    or the formation of a legal interchange agreement between the participating organizations.
    Open-edi Parties need to observe rule-based behaviour and possess the ability
    to make commitments in Open-edi (e.g., business, operational, technical, legal,
    and/or audit perspectives).\"\nISO/IEC 15944-1:2011 addresses the fundamental
    requirements of the commercial and legal frameworks and their environments on
    business transactions, and also integrates the requirements of the information
    technology and telecommunications environments.\nIn addition to the existing strategic
    directions of \"portability\" and \"interoperability\", the added strategic direction
    of ISO/IEC JTC 1 of \"cultural adaptability\" is supported in ISO/IEC 15944-1:2011.
    It also supports requirements arising from the public policy/consumer environment,
    cross-sectorial requirements and the need to address horizontal issues. It integrates
    these different sets of requirements. \nISO/IEC 15944-1:2011 allows constraints
    [which include legal requirements, commercial and/or international trade and contract
    terms, public policy (e.g. privacy/data protection, product or service labelling,
    consumer protection), laws and regulations] to be defined and clearly integrated
    into Open-edi through the BOV. This means that terms and definitions in ISO/IEC
    15944-1:2011 serve as a common bridge between these different sets of business
    operational requirements, allowing the integration of code sets and rules defining
    these requirements to be integrated into business processes electronically.\nISO/IEC
    15944-1:2011 contains a methodology and tool for specifying common business practices
    as parts of common business transactions in the form of scenarios, scenario attributes,
    roles, Information Bundles and Semantic Components. It achieves this by 1) developing
    standard computer processable specifications of common business rules and practices
    as scenarios and scenario components; and thus 2) maximizing the re-use of these
    components in business transactions."
