    ISO/TR 13195:2015 describes the steps necessary to understand the scope of Response Surface Methodology (RSM) and the method to analyse data collected using Central Composite Designs (CCD) through illustration with four distinct applications of this methodology.
    Response surface methodology (RSM) is used in order to investigate a relation between the response and the set of quantitative predictor variables or factors. Especially after specifying the vital few controllable factors, RSM is used in order to find the factor setting which optimizes the response.
