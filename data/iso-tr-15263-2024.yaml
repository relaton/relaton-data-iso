  script: Latn
  content: "This document describes how the evaluation of uncertainties in tensile
    tests can be obtained from tests at room temperature (ISO 6892-1) or elevated
    temperature (ISO 6892-2).\nThis document reports how it can be applied to tests
    performed at ambient and elevated temperatures under axial loading conditions
    with a digital acquisition of force and displacement. \nNOTE 1       As CWA 15261-2
    and UNCERT CoP 07 reports, the tests are assumed to run continuously without interruptions
    on test pieces that have uniform gauge lengths.\nNOTE 2       Annex C gives for
    information an indication of the typical scatter in tensile test results for a
    variety of materials that have been reported during laboratory inter-comparison
    exercises."
