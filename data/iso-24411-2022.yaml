    This document specifies requirements for the implementation of spacecraft level micro-vibration tests on space systems to be considered by test providers, including test designers and test engineers. It also gives guidance for spacecraft designers and interested parties.
    The spacecraft level micro-vibration test is applicable to space systems which contain payload equipment sensitive to the micro-vibration environment which only induced by the internal disturbance sources on-orbit, e.g. for the purpose of earth observation, space telescopes, optical experiments, telecommunication.
