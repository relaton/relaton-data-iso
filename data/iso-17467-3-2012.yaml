    ISO 17467-3:2012 specifies the physical and mechanical characteristics of fittings made from unplasticized polyamide (PA-U) in accordance with ISO 17467-1, intended to be buried and used for the supply of gaseous fuels for maximum operating pressure up to and including 4 bar.
    It also specifies the test parameters for the test methods to which it refers.
    ISO 17467-3:2012 also lays down requirements for dimensions and the marking of fittings.
    In conjunction with ISO 17467-1 and ISO 17467-2, ISO 17467-3 is applicable to PA-U fittings, their joints and to joints with components of PA-U.
    These fittings can be of the following types
    - solvent cement socket fittings,
    - solvent cement spigot fittings, and
    - solvent cement saddle fittings.
