abstract:
- content: "This International Standard defines the command set extensions for SCSI
    storage array devices; commonly known as RAID devices. This standard is principally
    intended to be used in conjunction with, not as an alternate to, any of the SCSI
    command standards nor to the SCSI-3 Architecture Model (ISO/IEC 14776-411) standard.
    This international standard is intended as an alternate to the SCSI-3 Controller
    Command (ISO/IEC 14776-341) standard. The resulting commands facilitate the control
    and configuration of SCSI storage arrays and thus provide a common command specification
    for both system integrators and suppliers of SCSI storage array devices.\nThis
    international standard contains all the information defined in SCSI-3 Controller
    Command (ISO/IEC 14776-341) standard. In addition this international standard
    specifies new commands and an expanded model clause.\nThe clause(s) of this standard
    pertaining to the SCSI storage array device class, implemented in conjunction
    with the applicable clauses within any of the SCSI command standards, shall specify
    the standard command set available for SCSI storage arrays.\nThe objective of
    the SCSI Controller Commands is to provide the following: \na) Transfer commands
    unique to SCSI Controller Command devices;\nb) Control commands to manage the
    operation of an SCSI Controller Command device; \nc) Optional device mapping and
    pass-through support."
