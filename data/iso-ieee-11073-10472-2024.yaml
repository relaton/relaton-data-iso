abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: Within the context of the ISO/IEEE 11073 family of standards for device
    communication, this standard establishes a normative definition of the communication
    between medication monitoring devices and managers (e.g., cell phones, personal
    computers, personal health appliances, set top boxes) in a manner that enables
    plug-and-play interoperability. It leverages appropriate portions of existing
    standards, including ISO/IEEE 11073 terminology, information models and application
    profile. It specifies the use of specific term codes, formats, and behaviors in
    telehealth environments restricting ambiguity in base frameworks in favor of interoperability.
    This standard defines a common core of communication functionality for medication
    monitors. In this context, medication monitors are defined as devices that have
    the ability to determine and communicate (to a manager) measures of a user’s adherence
    to a medication regime.
