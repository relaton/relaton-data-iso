    This document applies to resettable line-type heat detectors consisting of a sensing element distributed either continuously or discretely at close intervals along its length and connected to a sensor control unit, either directly or through an interface module, intended for use in fire detection and fire alarm systems installed in and around buildings and other civil engineering works. Examples of such technology are an optical fibre, a pneumatic tube, or an electrical sensor cable
    This document specifies the requirements and performance criteria, the corresponding test methods, and provides for the assessment.
    This document also covers resettable line-type heat detectors intended for use in the local protection of plants and equipment.
    This document does not cover non-resettable line-type heat detectors that can only respond once and are based on fixed temperature electrical cables.
