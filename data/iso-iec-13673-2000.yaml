    standard addresses the construction and use
    of test suites for verifying conformance of SGML
    systems. Its provisions assist those who build test
    suites, those who build SGML systems to be evaluated
    by such suites, and those who examine an
    SGML system's performance on a test suite as part
    of the process of selecting an SGML tool.
    In particular, this standard includes:
    ? criteria for the organization of test suites,
    including naming conventions, documentation
    conventions, and specification of applicable concrete
    syntaxes and features. Among other
    advantages, these conventions facilitate any
    non-SGML automatic processing that may be
    convenient for the developers or the users of the
    tests;
    NOTE ? An example of such non-SGML processing is
    sorting tests by name.
    ? a standard form for describing test results
    that makes clear what has been proven or disproven
    by the tests;
    ? the specification of a Reference Application
    for SGML Testing (RAST) that interprets all
    markup to allow machine comparison of test
    results for documents conforming to ISO 8879.
    RAST indicates in a standard way when tags,
    processing instructions, and data are recognized
    by the parser, replacing references and processing
    markup declarations and marked sections
    appropriately. RAST tests information likely to be
    passed by a general-purpose SGML parser to an
    application but does not test additional information
    that some parsers provide;
    ? the specification of a Reference Application
    for Capacity Testing (RACT) that reports a validating
    parser's capacity calculations. An SGML
    systemthat supports this application indicates its
    ability to report capacity errors regardless of
    whether it supports variant capacity sets;
    ? the specification of test procedures related to
    SDIF data streams.
    This standard applies to the testing only of aspects
    of SGML implementation and usage for which
    objective conformance criteria are defined in
    ISO 8879.
    NOTE ? Among the aspects of an SGML system not
    addressed by this standard are error recovery, phrasing
    of error messages, application results, and
    documentation (including the system declaration).
