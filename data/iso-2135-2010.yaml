  script: Latn
  content: "ISO 2135:2010 specifies an accelerated test method for assessing the fastness,
    using artificial light, of coloured anodic oxidation coatings on aluminium and
    its alloys.\nFor evaluating light fastness on exterior exposure, only outdoor
    exposure under conditions comparable to actual service is completely satisfactory.\nAccelerated
    testing is suitable as a quality-control test of coloured anodic oxidation coatings
    whose light-fastness number has already been established by means of outdoor exposure
    testing. \nThe method is applicable to coloured anodic oxidation coatings on aluminium
    and its alloys produced by any means and for any purpose.\nHowever, the method
    is not suitable for the measurement of coloured coatings with a light-fastness
    number already established by means of outdoor exposure testing, and of less than
    6."
