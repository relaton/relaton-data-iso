    ISO/TS 21219-24:2017 defines the LTE encryption mechanism for TPEG Service Data Frames. It has been specifically designed for use with Business to Business (B2B) business models.
    The objective of this document is to provide a simple to use, yet effective Conditional Access mechanism for TPEG including encryption for use with both broadcast and/or point-to-point delivery.
    For both service providers and device manufacturers, a standardized conditional access mechanism is beneficial to avoid a proliferation of proprietary methods with multiplied implementation effort and lead times.
