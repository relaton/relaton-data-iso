abstract:
- content: Specifies both preliminary levelling and geometrical tests for these general
    purpose and normal accuracy broaching machines, and gives the corresponding permissible
    deviations which apply. Gives also the terminology used for the main elements
    of the machine (in English, French and Russian as well as the equivalent terms
    in German). It deals only with the verification of accuracy of the machine. It
    does not apply to the testing of the running of the machine, nor to machine characteristics
    which should generally be checked before the accuracy is tested.
