    The Forward Space Packet (FSP) service is a Space Link Extension (SLE) transfer service that enables a mission to send Space Packets to a spacecraft in sequence-controlled or expedited mode. ISO 22672:2006 defines, in an abstract manner, the FSP service in terms of
    - the operations necessary to provide the transfer service;
    - the parameter data associated with each operation;
    - the behaviours that result from the invocation of each operation;
    - the relationship between, and the valid sequence of, the operations and resulting behaviours.
    It does not specify
    - individual implementations or products;
    - the implementation of entities or interfaces within real systems;
    - the methods or technologies required to radiate Space Packets to a spacecraft and to acquire telemetry frames from the signals received from that spacecraft for extraction of the Operational Control Field;
    - the methods or technologies required for communications;
    - the management activities necessary to schedule, configure, and control the FSP service.
