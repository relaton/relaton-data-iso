abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: Follows on from ISO 2854 and puts forward notions of the type II risk,
    the probability of not rejecting the null hypothesis when it is false. Deals with
    comparison of a mean with a given value (variance known or unknown), of two means
    (variance known or unknown), of a variance with a given value, and of two variances,
    and gives sets of curves for these type II risk for a given alternative and given
    size of sample and to determine the size of sample to be selected for a given
    alternative and a given values of type II risk.
