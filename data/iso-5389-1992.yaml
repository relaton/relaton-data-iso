abstract:
- content: Covers blowers or compressors and exhausters of the centrifugal, mixed
    flow, or axial flow types, with and without intercooling, handling any vapour
    or gas the physical properties of which are reliably known. May be applied to
    any compression process, with or without bleed-off or sidestreams, which takes
    place in one or more casings. The theory used is based on the laws of similarity
    of fluid flow. The observation of these laws determines specific requirements
    for the execution of acceptance tests.
