abstract:
- content: "The Biodiversity Net Gain (BNG) standard will provide guidance on the
    design and delivery of gains for biodiversity through the lifecycle of a project.
    \n\nThe standard will set out the requirements for delivering BNG at each stage
    of a project, from preparation through design and implementation and into maintenance
    and monitoring. It will be applicable to all scales of development or conservation
    projects. \n\nThe standard will draw together and build on existing work providing
    one version of BNG, enabling organisations to check when gains are delivered and
    clearly state when the standard has been met. The standard will enable greater
    transparency on delivery and contribute to demonstrating biodiversity net positive
    commitments.\n\nIt will apply to a broad range of potential users including auditors,
    developers, conservation organisations, land managers, consenting organisations
    and investors. \n\nThe BNG standard will link to existing work and examples to
    assist understanding and facilitate implementation of the guidance."
