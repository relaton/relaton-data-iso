    ISO 15398:2012 specifies the definitions and requirements for thermoplastics covers and frames for inspection chambers and other such pipeline access products installed in light vehicular access and pedestrian areas and manufactured from unplasticized poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC-U), polypropylene (PP), polypropylene with mineral modifier (PP-MD) or polyethylene (PE). The products are rated up to B 125 max. and are intended for use either inside or outside buildings including swimming pool areas but are not intended for use in the carriageway of trafficked areas.
    It is only applicable to those covers and frames where the manufacturer has clearly stated in the documentation how the frames are installed and assembled to the intended access product, identifying as necessary the manufacturer and grades of product or riser to which the frame is intended to fit.
