  content: Applicable to products having CO2 contents of more than 0.01 % (m/m). Three
    cases are envisaged. The product containing neither sulphides nor chlorates or
    containing sulphides or chlorates. The principle in presence of neither sulphides
    nor chlorates consists in liberation of carbon dioxide in a flow of gas and absorption
    in an excess of standard volumetric barium hydroxide solution. Titration of the
    excess with standard volumetric hydrochloric acid solution in the presence of
    thymolphthalein as indicator. In presence of sulphides, pretreatment by oxidation
    of the sulphides by hydrogen peroxide and boiling, in presence of chlorates, pretreatment
    by reduction of the chlorates to chlorides by the addition of iron(II) sulphate.
