  content: "ISO 10639:2004 specifies the properties of piping system components made
    from glass-reinforced thermosetting plastics (GRP) based on unsaturated polyester
    resin (UP) for water supply with or without pressure, as well as the properties
    of the system itself.\nIt is applicable to GRP-UP piping systems, with flexible
    or rigid joints with or without end thrust load-bearing capability, primarily
    intended for use in buried installations. \nIt is applicable to pipes, fittings
    and their joints of nominal sizes from DN 50 to DN 4000 which are intended to
    be used for the conveyance of water at temperatures up to 50 °C, with or without
    pressure. In a pipework system, pipes and fittings of different nominal pressure
    and stiffness ratings may be used together."
