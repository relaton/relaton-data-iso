    The purpose of ISO 28841:2013 is to provide sufficient information to perform the seismic assessment and rehabilitation of the structural concrete building that complies with the limitations established in ISO 28841:2013, for both undamaged structures that are deemed not to comply with the required characteristics for an adequate response at a specified performance level, and for structures that have undergone damage under seismic loadings. The rules of design as set forth in ISO 28841:2013 are simplifications of more elaborate requirements.
    ISO 28841:2013 can be used as an alternative to the development of a building code, or equivalent document in countries where no national design codes are available by themselves, or as an alternative to the building code in countries where specifically considered and accepted by the national standards body or other appropriate regulatory organization, and applies to the assessment of earthquake resistance capability and to the seismic rehabilitation design and construction for existing structural concrete buildings.
