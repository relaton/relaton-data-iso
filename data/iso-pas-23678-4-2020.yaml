    This document establishes a uniform, safe and consistent approach to the in-field competence assessment of personnel for the maintenance, thorough examination, operational testing, overhaul and repair of lifeboats (including free-fall lifeboats) and rescue boats (including fast rescue boats), launching appliances and release gear.
    It also provides the necessary information for interested parties to grant authorization, effectively evaluate and audit training, supporting the IMO Requirements, Section 3.
    It specifies the Level 2 in-field initial and ongoing competence assessment for personnel certified by a manufacturer or an authorized service provider to carry out maintenance, thorough examination, operational testing, overhaul and repair of lifeboats (including free-fall lifeboats) and rescue boats (including fast rescue boats), launching appliances and release gear.
    The training an individual receives whilst following a development process is covered in ISO/PAS 23678-2 and ISO/PAS 23678-3.
    The competence requirements contained in this document provide a clear description of performance in-field in respect to:
    a)   what practitioners are expected to do;
    b)   the underpinning knowledge and skills they require to enable them to do what is expected;
    c)   how they can demonstrate what is expected of them;
    d)   how their performance can be assessed.
    This document is intended to be used in conjunction with ISO/PAS 23678-1, ISO/PAS 23678-2 and ISO/PAS 23678-4.
    This document is applicable to the following types of lifeboats (including free-fall lifeboats), rescue boats (including fast rescue boats), launching appliances and release gear.
    Survival craft types:
    a)   single fall totally enclosed lifeboats with sprinkler and air systems;
    b)   twin fall totally enclosed lifeboats with sprinkler and air systems;
    c)   partially enclosed lifeboats;
    d)   tender lifeboats;
    e)   freefall lifeboats;
    f)    open lifeboat;
    g)   inflatable rescue boats;
    h)   rigid rescue boats;
    i)     semi ridged inflatable rescue boats;
    j)     rigid fast rescue boats;
    k)   rigid inflatable fast rescue boats.
    Survival craft propulsion system types:
    a)   inboard diesel engines;
    b)   outboard engines;
    c)   propeller drives;
    d)   jet drives.
    Davit types:
    a)   gravity single and twin fall outrigger;
    b)   hydraulic single pivoting/luffing;
    c)   hydraulic multi pivot/luffing;
    d)   telescopic;
    e)   gravity roller track;
    f)    gravity free fall primary;
    g)   free fall hydraulic secondary;
    h)   A-frame hydraulic;
    i)     single arm slewing (manual, electric);
    j)     davits with stored power systems.
    Winch types:
    a)   twin drum;
    b)   single drum;
    c)   gravity-lowering, electric hoisting;
    d)   gravity-lowering hydraulic hoisting;
    e)   hydraulic hoisting and lowering.
    Hook release system types:
    a)   on-load/off load(load not over centre);
    b)    on-load/offload (load over centre);
    c)   off load;
    d)   freefall hydraulic;
    e)   automatic.
