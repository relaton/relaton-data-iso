  content: "This document specifies short-range wireless active communication between
    two active IoT/telematic hardware items, such as a gateway device and/or a sensor.
    \nNOTE            Active hardware item in this document refers to devices and
    sensors, which have capacity to record and transmit measurements, i.e. data, without
    external activation through extra accessories, e.g. readers or scanners.\nThe
    application of such communications is based on equipment and container type. This
    document covers the following:\n—     wireless technology choices for wireless
    communication involving active hardware items, i.e. sensor to device communication;\n—    
    critical design factors of containers and hardware items intended to be used within
    one container environment;\n—     parameters for open protocol communication and
    possible applications (use cases).\nThis document does not define installation
    locations for devices and sensors; however, it is expected that the hardware items
    are installed on or in the container, based on the following considerations:\n—    
    existing regulations and standards;\n—     container design, and specification
    of the material it is made of;\n—     best possible connection, which enables
    interoperable communication between sensor and device;\n—     cargo and personnel
    safety.\nDue to the pace of technology development, the number of connected sensors
    to one gateway device are not defined in this document. This document assumes
    that at least one sensor can be connected to at least one gateway device wirelessly."
