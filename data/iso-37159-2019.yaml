- content: |-
    This document specifies a procedure to organize smart transportation that enables one-day trips by citizens between cities and in a large city zone, including its surrounding areas, and conveys a large number of people at a high frequency in a short time over distances of up to 1 000 km.
    Smart transportation aims to promote political and economic work and stimulate business activity by providing citizens with a manner of travel to complete a return trip from their home or place of work to destinations outside their cities on the same day. However, this document does not designate a procedure for constructing smart transportation facilities.
    NOTE       "One-day trip" means travel from an origin to a destination and back to the origin on the same day. The purpose of such travel is out of the scope of this document.
