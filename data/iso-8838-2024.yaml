    This document specifies requirements for the selection and use of water-lubricated plain bearing materials used in different equipment and plants under various lubrication conditions, such as
    —     fluid-film lubrication condition,
    —     mixed lubrication condition, and
    —     condition comprising a non-lubrication condition which shifts to a fluid-film lubrication condition.
    In addition, this document also specifies requirements for mating (shaft) material, the lubrication method and for items to consider during the design of water-lubricated plain bearing materials.
    The water used as a lubricant is pure water, tap water, river water or seawater. This document does not apply to the water solution of chemicals, refrigerants, liquid fuels, etc.
