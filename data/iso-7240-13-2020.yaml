    This document specifies the requirements for compatibility and connectability assessment of the components of fire detection and alarm systems, fire protection systems and voice alarm systems.
    This document only includes system requirements when these are necessary for compatibility assessment.
    This document also specifies requirements for the integrity of the fire detection and fire alarm system when connected to other systems.
    This document does not specify the manner in which the system is designed, installed and used in any particular application.
    This document does not cover components or functions which are not included in the fire detection and alarm systems (FDAS), such as functions performed by a building management system.
    Methods of assessment are specified to permit an acceptable degree of confidence within predetermined operational and environmental conditions to be achieved.
    The requirements for the transmission path used for a distributed function are covered by a relevant ISO standard and not by this document.
    This document is applicable to systems where the components are connected to control-and-indicating equipment (CIE) and where the components are interconnected by electrical wires or optical fibre or by radio frequency links or by any combination of these.
    ISO 7240-25 provides additional information and requirements about systems using radio frequency links.
    NOTE    Other International Standards are expected to cover the requirements of other systems to which the fire detection and fire alarm system is connected.
