    This document is intended to be applied to the usage of ISO 26262 methodology for rechargeable energy storage systems (RESS), for example, lithium-ion battery systems, that are installed in series-production road vehicles, excluding mopeds.
    This document does not address unique E/E systems in special vehicles such as E/E systems designed for drivers with disabilities.
    This document provides:
    a)       a generic informative framework regarding the interaction of E/E systems with elements of other technologies with respect to the ISO 26262 series aspects of item definition, hazard analysis and risk assessment (HARA), functional safety concept (FSC), verification and validation (V&V), and production, operation, service and decommissioning (POSD);
    b)       various examples elaborating the generic framework;
    c)        topics which could be considered in future editions of the ISO 26262 series.
    RESS includes BMS, cells, harnesses, connectivity, etc. In order to achieve product safety non-E/E functional safety requirements need to be fulfilled by the other technology itself without the support of E/E technology. These requirements are not in scope of this document.
