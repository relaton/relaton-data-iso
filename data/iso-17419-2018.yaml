    This document
    —          describes and specifies globally unique addresses and identifiers (ITS-S object identifiers) which are both internal and external to ITS stations and are used for ITS station management,
    —          describes how ITS-S object identifiers and related technical parameters are used for classification, registration and management of ITS applications and ITS application classes,
    —          describes how ITS-S object identifiers are used in the ITS communication protocol stack,
    —          introduces an organizational framework for registration and management of ITS-S objects,
    —          defines and specifies management procedures at a high functional level,
    —          is based on the architecture of an ITS station specified in ISO 21217:2014 as a Bounded Secured Managed Domain (BSMD),
    —          specifies an ASN.1 module for the identifiers, addresses, and registry records identified in this document, and
    —          specifies an ASN.1 module for a C-ITS Data Dictionary containing ASN.1 type definitions of general interest.
