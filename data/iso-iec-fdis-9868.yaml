abstract:
- content: "This standard establishes recommendations and requirements for remote
    biometric identification systems including both real-time and ex-post, including
    AI-based systems: \n\n1.\tTechnical solutions to be implemented in the design
    and development phases in relation to the following:\no\tappropriateness of training
    and testing datasets and data management practices for the intended purpose;\no\tlogging
    capabilities enabling the automatic recording of events (‘logs’) while the system
    is operating;\no\tprovision of information to instruct the operator of the system
    and information for appropriate use;\no\thuman oversight measures, enabling the
    system to be effectively overseen and managed during the period of use;\no\taccuracy,
    robustness and cybersecurity.\n\n2.\tThe standard also establishes requirements
    on development practices:\no\tRisk management process to be implemented by the
    provider when designing and developing the system, notably in relation to the
    identification and implementation of solutions described under point (1)\no\tQuality
    management systems to be implemented by the provider in its organisation, including
    a system for post-market monitoring\n\n3.\tThe standard also establishes requirements
    on post-deployment tests and audit of the systems, including:\no\tVerification
    and testing procedures to assess whether the deployed system is proportionate
    and fit-for-purpose against the requirements given in point (1);\no\tVerification
    and testing procedures to assess the biometric recognition components are fit-for-purpose
    against the requirements given in point (1);\no\tVerification procedure to control
    the appropriateness of the quality management system measures and processes, as
    described under point (2).\n\nWhile the emphasis is on surveillance systems, other
    types of remote biometric identification systems are in scope, regardless of biometric
    modality or sensing technology. Not in scope are personal authentication systems,
    and other types of voluntary, opt-in, systems. \n\nNote: This scope includes both
    technical biometric aspects and management systems aspects, as discussed on page
    7.  The latter will be developed as a sector-specific extension of ISO/IEC 42001
    AI - Management System."
