abstract:
- content: |-
    This document specifies the antimicrobial performance assessment method of textiles containing manufactured (metals/metal oxides) nanomaterials (TCMNMs). The textiles in this document include fabric, yarn and fibre in which manufactured nanomaterials are used during production or finishing process. Further, this document also specifies protocols to determine the quantity of nanomaterials released from textile following washing and/or exposure to artificial human body sweat.
    This document only covers the antibacterial, antifungal, and the anti-odour performance assessment method of TCMNMs.
    This document does not cover textiles that have therapeutic application as well as environment, health and safety (EHS) issues related to TCMNMs. Further, it does not cover the release of nanomaterials from TCMNMs as a result of aging, dry attrition and abrasion, although it is considered as an effective factor in releasing nanomaterials.
