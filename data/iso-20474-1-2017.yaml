abstract:
- content: |-
    ISO 20474-1:2017 specifies the general safety requirements for earth-moving machinery as defined in ISO 6165, each of these requirements being common to two or more earth-moving machine families. It is also applicable to machine attachments, and to derivative machinery designed primarily for equipment used to excavate, load, transport, drill, spread, compact or trench earth, rock, and other materials.
    It is intended to be used in conjunction with the other parts of ISO 20474, which give the provisions that are specific to particular machine families. Those specific requirements take precedence over the requirements of this document for the machines concerned. For multipurpose machinery, all of those parts of ISO 20474 whose requirements cover the functions and applications of such machines are applicable.
    EXAMPLE       For a compact loader also used as a trencher, the relevant requirements of ISO 20474‑1, ISO 20474‑3 and ISO 20474‑10 are applicable.
    ISO 20474-1:2017 deals with all significant hazards, hazardous situations and events relevant to the earth-moving machinery within its scope (see Annex A) when used as intended or under conditions of misuse reasonably foreseeable by the manufacturer. It specifies the appropriate technical measures for eliminating or reducing risks arising from relevant hazards, hazardous situations or events during commissioning, operation and maintenance.
    Specific requirements related to autonomous machines are covered in ISO 17757.
    ISO 20474-1:2017 is not applicable to machines manufactured before the date of its publication.
