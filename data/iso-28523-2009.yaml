    ISO 28523:2009 specifies methods for dynamic and static extraction of fluid samples from lubricating and hydraulic oil systems.
    A correct execution of the sampling is essential when analysing fluids from lubricating and hydraulic oil systems.
    In order to achieve reliable and comparable analysis results, the sampling must be performed under defined conditions and operating environment.
    When the system has reached its operating temperature, a representative sample is extracted from where the fluid is in a turbulent flow condition. This method is called dynamic sampling. If this is not possible, the sample can be extracted from the system tank. This method is called static sampling.
    ISO 28523:2009 specifies methods for both dynamic and static sampling in connection with collection in bottles.
    For extraction of samples through a filtration kit for comparison with “master slides”, reference is made to the manuals from the suppliers of such equipment.
