    This document describes the necessary steps of the one-way and two-way analyses of variance (ANOVA) for fixed effect models in balanced design. Unbalanced design, random effects and nested design patterns are not included in this document.
    This document provides examples to analyse the differences among group means by splitting the overall observed variance into different parts. Several illustrations from different fields with different emphasis suggest the procedure of the analysis of variance.
