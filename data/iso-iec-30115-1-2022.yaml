  script: Latn
  content: This document defines the required protocols, data model, behaviors, and
    other architectural components for an interoperable, multivendor, remote, and
    out-of-band capable interface. This interface meets the cloud-based and web-based
    IT professionals' expectations for scalable platform management. While large and
    hyperscale environments are the primary focus, clients can use the document for
    individual system management.This document defines the required elements for all
    Redfish implementations, and the optional elements that system vendors and manufacturers
    can choose. This document also defines at which points an implementation can provide
    OEM-specific extensions.This document sets normative requirements for Redfish
    services and associated materials, such as Redfish schema files. In general, this
    document does not set requirements for Redfish clients but indicates how a client
    can successfully and effectively access and use a Redfish service.This document
    does not require that implementations of the Redfish interfaces and functions
    require particular hardware or firmware.
