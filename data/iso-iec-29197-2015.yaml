abstract:
- content: |-
    ISO/IEC 29197:2015 addresses
    ?   fundamental requirements for planning and execution of environmental performance evaluations for biometric systems based on scenario and operational test methodologies,
    ?   specifications to define, establish, and measure specific conditions to assess, including requirements for equipment,
    ?   requirements for establishing a baseline performance in order to compare the influence of environmental parameters,
    ?   a specification of the biometric evaluation including requirements for test population, test protocols, data to record, and test results, and
    ?   procedures for carrying out the overall evaluation.
    It does not
    ?   determine which parameters should be analysed for a specific biometric modality (This is currently covered in ISO/IEC/TR 19795‑3.),
    ?   specify requirements to perform a vulnerability analysis modifying environmental factors (This is covered by ISO/IEC 19792.),
    ?   classify biometric systems upon performance against different environmental conditions, or
    ?   specify requirements for determining the functional effects of environmental conditions on hardware components (such as corrosion, electrical interference, breakage, etc.) of biometric systems.
