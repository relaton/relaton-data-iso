    ISO 21927-8:2017 applies to smoke control dampers, placed on the market and intended to operate as part of a pressure differential system or smoke and heat control system. This document specifies requirements and gives reference to the test methods defined for smoke control dampers and their associated components, such as actuators which are intended to be installed in such systems in buildings. Furthermore, provision on marking and information on installation and maintenance of these products are also given.
    ISO 21927-8:2017 distinguishes between two categories of smoke control dampers, i.e. single-compartment smoke control dampers and multi‑compartment fire-resisting smoke control dampers.
    Smoke control dampers covered by this document can be installed into smoke control system ducts or onto the ducts' surface. They can be installed also into a wall, floor or ceiling/roof elements or onto the surface of these elements.
    NOTE          To avoid duplication, reference is made to a variety of other standards. To this end, this document can be read in conjunction with EN 13501‑4, EN 1366‑10 and ISO 10294‑1 for details of the furnace testing.
    ISO 21927-8:2017 does not consider in detail the detrimental and/or corrosive effects that can be caused by process chemicals present in the atmosphere, which are drawn through the system intentionally or inadvertently.
