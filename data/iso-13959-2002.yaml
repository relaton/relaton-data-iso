    This International Standard specifies minimum requirements for water to be used in the preparation of concentrates and dialysing fluids for haemodialysis and haemodiafiltration.
    This International Standard does not address the operation of water treatment equipment nor the final mixing of treated water with concentrates to produce the fluids used in such therapies. That operation is the sole responsibility of dialysis professionals.
    This International Standard is not applicable to dialysing-fluid regenerating systems.
