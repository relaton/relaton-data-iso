abstract:
- content: Includes a method for the determination in the range 0,001 to 0,180 % (m/m)
    from distillate and residual fuel oils, crude oils, lubricating oils, waxes and
    other petroleum products, in which any ash-forming materials present are normally
    considered to be undesirable impurities or contaminants. The method is limited
    to products which are free from added ash-forming additives, including certain
    phosphorus compounds.
