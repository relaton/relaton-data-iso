abstract:
- content: "This document addresses the specification and demonstration of system
    reliability to successfully deliver a dose based on the potential consequence
    of failure (harm) of a function or action or the absence of an attribute, as part
    of design verification, utilizing empirical methods as well as in vitro/in silico
    modelling. This includes risk-based techniques to establish and support the required
    reliability for all single use (disposable) drug delivery systems, including those
    that provide a single or multiple dose(s), that are provided to be delivered with
    a specified brand or type of medicinal product.\n\nDrug delivery systems covered
    by this document include, but are not limited to:\n\n―\tNeedle-based injection
    systems (ISO 11608-1);\n―\tNeedle-free injection systems (ISO 21649);\n―\tAerosol
    drug delivery systems (ISO 20072).\n\nDrug delivery systems not covered in this
    document:\n\n―\tWith containers that can be refilled multiple times or be replaced;
    \n―\tIntended for dental use;\n―\tFinished needles;\n―\tEmpty syringes;\n―\tCatheters;\n―\tMulti
    patient use.\n\nPumps (IEC 60601-2-24 (if electronic) or ISO 28620 (if non-electronic))
    or stand-alone prefilled syringes defined by ISO 11040-8, are excluded. \n\nNOTE\tDrug
    delivery systems not in scope of this document may still benefit from elements
    in this document but provisions of this document might not completely fulfil the
    basic safety and effectiveness of such drug delivery systems."
