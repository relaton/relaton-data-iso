abstract:
- content: Defines the effective case depth, and specifies methods for the determination
    of this depth, in steel. Is applicable to carburized cases and carbo-nitrided
    cases, the depth of which is greater than 0,3 mm, and parts which have a hardness
    of less than 450 HV at a distance of 3 X the effective case depth from the surface.
