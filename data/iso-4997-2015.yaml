    ISO 4997:2015 applies to cold-reduced carbon steel sheet of structural quality in grades CR220, CR250, CR320, and CH550, usually without the use of microalloying elements. The product is intended for structures that include bolting, riveting, and welding. It is generally used in the delivered condition for fabricating purposes, such as bending, forming, and welding.
    ISO 4997:2015 does not cover steels designated as commercial quality or drawing qualities (covered in ISO 3574), cold-reduced carbon steel sheet according to hardness requirements (covered in ISO 5954), cold-reduced steel sheet of higher strength with improved formability (covered in ISO 13887), or cold-reduced steel sheet of high tensile strength and low yield point with improved formability (covered in ISO 14590).
