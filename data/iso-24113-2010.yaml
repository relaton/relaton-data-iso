- content: |-
    ISO 24113:2010 defines the primary space debris mitigation requirements applicable to all elements of unmanned systems launched into, or passing through, near-Earth space, including launch vehicle orbital stages, operating spacecraft and any objects released as part of normal operations or disposal actions.
    The requirements contained in ISO 24113:2010 aim to reduce the growth of space debris by ensuring that spacecraft and launch vehicle orbital stages are designed, operated and disposed of in a manner that prevents them from generating debris throughout their orbital lifetime.
    ISO 24113:2010 is the top-level standard in a series of standards addressing debris mitigation. It will be the main interface for the user, bridging between the primary debris mitigation requirements and the lower level implementation standards that will ensure compliance.
    ISO 24113:2010 does not cover launch phase safety for which specific rules are defined elsewhere.
