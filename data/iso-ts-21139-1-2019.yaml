    This document defines use profiles for commercial prints in terms of typical environmental stress factors and any mechanical and chemical stress factors to be considered additionally in their application.
    Methods and principles defined in this document apply to the various product classes of "commercial prints" that, following the terminology of ISO/TS 19300, include commercial production prints (flyers, brochures), transactional and stationary prints, signage, newspapers and periodical prints, book printing as well as packaging printing. These commercial prints often contain combinations of text, pictorial images and/or artwork. Prints for non-commercial use, including prints use and display in consumer home environments and prints exhibited or stored in museum context, are outside the scope of this document.
    For each use profile a set of suitable accelerated test methods for the leading environmental and/or mechanical or chemical stress factors is defined for representative testing. Guidance is given for translation of test results into suitable image permanence performance claims considering the variability of actual use in comparison to reference use profiles.
    The test methods and guiding principle described in this document apply to both, analogue and digitally printed matter, and the corresponding test targets from the ISO 12647 series are used. Methods and principles apply to both colour and monochrome prints.
