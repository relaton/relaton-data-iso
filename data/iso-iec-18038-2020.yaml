    This document defines the framework and information reference model for representing sensor-based 3D mixed-reality worlds. It defines concepts, an information model, architecture, system functions, and how to integrate 3D virtual worlds and physical sensors in order to provide mixed-reality applications with physical sensor interfaces. It defines an exchange format necessary for transferring and storing data between physical sensor-based mixed-reality applications.
    This document specifies the following functionalities:
    a)   representation of physical sensors in a 3D scene;
    b)   definition of physical sensors in a 3D scene;
    c)   representation of functionalities of each physical sensor in a 3D scene;
    d)   representation of physical properties of each physical sensor in a 3D scene;
    e)   management of physical sensors in a 3D scene;
    f)    interface with physical sensor information in a 3D scene.
    This document defines a reference model for physical sensor-based mixed-reality applications to represent and to exchange functions of physical sensors in 3D scenes. It does not define specific physical interfaces necessary for manipulating physical devices, but rather defines common functional interfaces that can be used interchangeably between applications.
    This document does not define how specific applications are implemented with specific physical sensor devices. It does not include computer generated sensor information using computer input/output devices such as a mouse or a keyboard. The sensors in this document represent physical sensor devices in the real world.
