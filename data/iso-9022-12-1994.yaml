  content: Specifies methods for the testing of optical instruments and instruments
    containing optical components, under equivalent conditions, for their ability
    to resist contamination, i.e. contact with corrosive chemical substances. The
    purpose of testing is to investigate the resistance of an instrument and, in particular,
    of instrument surfaces, coatings or synthetic materials, to a short exposure to
    the contamination. The tests described are designed for the selection of materials
    and components for the instruments. Complete instruments or assemblies are only
    tested in exceptional cases.
