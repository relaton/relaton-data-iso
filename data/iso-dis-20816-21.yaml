abstract:
- content: "This document provides information about the measurement and evaluation
    of the mechanical vibration of wind turbines and their components. The working
    principle of wind turbines covered by this document is described in annex B.\n\nOn
    account of the great influence which the place of installation and type of mechanical
    drive train can have on the vibration magnitude of all wind turbine components,
    it is necessary to divide the wind turbines into two groups:\n\ngroup 1: horizontal
    axis wind turbine installations with generators coupled to the rotor via a gearbox;\ngroup
    2: horizontal axis wind turbine installations with generators coupled to the rotor
    without a gearbox (direct drive).\n\nThis part of ISO 20816 applies to group 1
    and group 2 wind turbines. It applies to horizontal axis wind turbines with rated
    generator outputs exceeding 200 kW and the following design and operation characteristics:\n\na)
    installation onshore or off the coast (offshore);\nb) installation on supporting
    systems (tower and foundation) made of steel and concrete;\nc) horizontal-axis
    rotor with several rotor blades;\nd) rotor bearing separate from or integrated
    into the gearbox or into the generator;\ne) generator direct coupled (gearless)
    or driven via gearbox;\nf) generators of the synchronous or asynchronous type;\ng)
    generators with only a fixed pole number or which are pole-changeable for speed
    adjustment;\nh) permanent magnet or electrical excited induction generator with
    inner or outer rotor;\ni) power output control by rotor blade angle control (pitch
    adjustment – individual or collective);\nj) nacelle with active yaw system to
    align to wind direction.\n\nThis document recommends zones for evaluating the
    vibration at continuous load operation. However, in most cases these evaluation
    zone boundaries might not be suitable for the early detection of faults. Annex
    A presents evaluation zone boundaries based on vibration data from thousands of
    wind turbines with rated generator output up to 5 MW. They can be helpful in facilitating
    discussion between users and manufacturers.\n\nThe evaluation criteria contained
    in this standard mainly serve to ensure a reliable, safe long-term operation of
    the wind turbine and its components. It is intended to standardize measurements,
    to assist in their evaluation and to make possible a comparative evaluation of
    the vibration measured in wind turbines and their components. In addition, recommendations
    are given for the determination of limit values for operation. \n\nAlthough the
    type and implementation of broad-band vibration monitoring for wind turbines is
    addressed, this document does not apply to diagnostics or fault detection by condition
    monitoring of wind turbines.\n\nThe evaluation of the balance quality of the slowly
    turning wind turbine rotor, which requires special measurements and analysis,
    is not covered by this document.\n\nThis document does not apply to the evaluation
    of torsional vibration in the drive train. Although coupled lateral and torsional
    vibration of tower and drive train can affect the amplitudes of the defined vibration
    characteristics, diagnosis of this kind of vibration source is not feasible by
    the described measurement methods described in this document. For general design
    verification purposes and for specific fault diagnosis, special measurements are
    required which are beyond the scope of this document.\n\nThis part of ISO 20816
    also does not apply to acceptance measurements on gearboxes and generators in
    the manufacturer's test facility.\n\nThis document does not apply to measurements
    of shaft displacement, due to the small number of turbines equipped with such
    measurements."
