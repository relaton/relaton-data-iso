    ISO/IEC 21277:2018 defines test methods to measure the performance of crypto suites of radio frequency identification (RFID) devices (tags and interrogators) for item management as specified in ISO/IEC 18000‑63 and ISO/IEC 29167 (all parts).
    These test methods measure the crypto suite system performance (tags and interrogators) against the crypto suite outcomes as required by the desired set of use case requirements for a specific application/service. These test methods are used as an extension of ISO/IEC 18046‑1 but can be used in a standalone manner.
    Crypto suite performance can vary substantially between crypto suites, implementations of a crypto suite for tags and interrogators and crypto suite outcomes in specific interrogation scenarios. Tag crypto functions require time and energy to complete successfully. The desired crypto strength and method influence the time and energy required. "Crypto suite performance" is therefore defined in this document as "the shortest time to complete a crypto outcome at a given read distance in relation to the RF power available". This document provides guidelines in the evaluation of the measurement results.
    The test methods do not measure crypto capabilities which include crypto strength, suitability and robustness. They neither measure random generator performance nor deal with key management.
