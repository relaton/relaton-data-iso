abstract:
- content: "1.1  Fields of application  \nThis document provides management and engineering
    guidance within the Intermediate profile for the Business Management, Project
    Management, System Definition and Realisation and Acquisition Management processes.\nThis
    document is applicable to Very Small Entities (VSEs). VSEs are enterprises, organisations,
    departments or projects having up to 25 people. The lifecycle processes described
    in the ISO/IEC 29110 series are not intended to preclude or discourage their use
    by organisations bigger than VSEs.\nThis document has been developed using the
    management and engineering guide from the systems engineering Basic profile. Elements
    were added or modified (e.g. process, task, work product, role) to support VSEs
    involved in the development of more than one project in parallel with more than
    one work team.\nThis guide is oriented towards the management of more than one
    project in parallel with more than one work team.\nThis document applies for the
    development of non-critical systems.\nUsing this document, a VSE can obtain benefits
    in the following aspects:\n—     An agreed set of project requirements (technical
    part of contract) and expected work products are agreed by the Acquirer.\n—     A
    disciplined management process, that provides project visibility and corrective
    actions of project problems and deviations, is performed.\n—     A systematic
    System Definition and Realisation process, that satisfies Acquirer needs and helps
    ensure quality work products, is followed.\nOnce the system, developed by a VSE,
    has been accepted by their customers, the VSE that wants to provide after delivery
    services can refer to ISO/IEC TR 29110-5-3.\nIn the context of systems engineering,
    that is the System Definition and Realisation (SR) process, the group that is
    part of the VSE responsible for developing software elements that are part of
    the system are encouraged to use the management and engineering guide of the software
    engineering Intermediate profile (ISO/IEC TR 29110-5-1-3).\nThis document is targeted
    at VSEs that do not develop critical systems and have little or no experience
    with systems engineering (SE) process planning and implementation using ISO/IEC/IEEE
    15288.\nThis document is also targeted to VSEs which are familiar with management
    and engineering guide of the systems engineering Basic profile (ISO/IEC TR 29110
    5-6-2) for their system development projects and are involved in the development
    of more than one project in parallel with more than one work team.\nThis document
    is intended to be used with any processes, techniques and methods that enhance
    the VSE's Stakeholder satisfaction and productivity."
