abstract:
- content: The procedures are applicable to crude or refined products in the course
    of filling, or to products already contained in drums or in transportable or fixed
    tanks. Owing to the heterogeneity of the lots it is recommended to adopt the sampling
    during filling. Specifies particular precautions in view of the very hygroscopic
    nature of the product. The principle consists in samplings, at regular intervals,
    of equal quantities throughout filling. Mixing of these successive samples, homogenization
    and then taking the laboratory samples.
