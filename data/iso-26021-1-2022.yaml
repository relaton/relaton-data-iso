    This document is applicable to road vehicles, where the electronic vehicle interface of the diagnostic link connector (DLC) is used to perform an end-of-life (EoL) activation of in-vehicle pyrotechnic devices. Apart from actual removal, this is the method to assure that no pyrotechnic substances are left in an EoL vehicle. On-board activation is an effective and safe method.
    This document describes use cases and specifies technical requirements in order to support the end-of-life activation of in-vehicle pyrotechnic devices via the electronic communication interface. This document references the ISO 14229 series unified diagnostic services implemented on diagnostic communication over controller area network (DoCAN) and Internet Protocol (DoIP) along with the required provision of data definitions.
    This document comprises:
    —    terminology definitions;
    —    definition of end-of-life activation of in-vehicle pyrotechnic devices relevant use cases;
    —    requirements for the establishment of communication between the pyrotechnic device deployment tool (PDT) and the vehicle's pyrotechnic control unit(s) (PCU(s));
    —    requirements for the optional usage of a credentials-based authentication and authorisation mechanism between the PDT and the vehicle;
    —    requirements for the protection against tampering of the defined end-of-life activation of in-vehicle pyrotechnic devices;
    —    PCU-relevant technical requirements.
    PDT-relevant requirements are specified in a test equipment-specific standard with PDT-specific requirements.
