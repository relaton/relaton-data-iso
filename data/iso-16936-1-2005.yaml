  content: "ISO 16936-1:2005 specifies requirements and a test method for security
    glazing designed to resist impacts of a hard body by delaying access of objects
    and/or persons to a protected space for a short period of time. \nISO 16936-1:2005
    classifies security-glazing products into categories of resistance to repetitive
    impacts of a steel sphere. The categories of resistance have not been assigned
    to special applications. Glazing classification should be specified on an individual
    basis for every application.\nISO 16936-1:2005 deals with mechanical resistance
    to impact only."
