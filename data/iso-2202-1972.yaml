  content: Specifies a method for the determination of the volatile water, that which
    volatilizes at the same time as the liquid chlorine. It is intended for products
    with a moisture content of 0,001 % (m/m). The principle consists in contious absorption
    of the water in the gasified chlorine, flowing at a rate of 100 ml/min over phosphorus
    pentoxide applied in a thin layer on a glass rod. The glass rod forms an electrolytic
    cell be means of two electrodes (for example, platinum) wound over its entire
    length. Decomposition of the water, on absorption. by electrolysis. Measurement
    of the electrolytic current, which is a function of the water content.
