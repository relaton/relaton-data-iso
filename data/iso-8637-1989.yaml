  content: "ISO 8637:1989 specifies requirements for haemodialysers, including those
    of \n  coil, hollow-fibre and parallel-plate design, haemofilters and haemoconcentrators
    \n  for single use for humans. Requirements for materials of construction and
    test \n  methods for biocompatibility, validation of sterility, non-pyrogenicity
    and \n  certain performance characteristics are not included.\nISO 8637:1989 does
    not apply to devices assembled and sterilized by the user, \n  nor to devices
    for the extracorporeal blood circuit, plasma filters, haemoperfusion \n  devices,
    vascular access devices, blood pumps, pressure monitors of the extracorporeal
    \n  circuit, air detection devices or systems to prepare, maintain or monitor
    dialysing \n  fluid."
