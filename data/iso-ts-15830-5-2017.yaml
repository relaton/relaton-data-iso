    ISO/TS 15830-5:2017 specifies requirements and other design information which became available since 2013 for the WorldSID 50th percentile side-impact dummy, a standardized anthropomorphic dummy for side-impact tests of road vehicles. It is applicable to impact tests involving:
    -      passenger vehicles of category M1 and goods vehicles of category N1;
    -      impacts to the side of the vehicle structure; and
    -      impact tests involving use of an anthropomorphic dummy as a human surrogate for the purpose of evaluating compliance with vehicle safety standards.
