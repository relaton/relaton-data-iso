  content: |-
    ISO/IEC TS 18508:2015 speciﬁes the form and establishes the interpretation of facilities that extend the For-tran language deﬁned by ISO/IEC 1539-1:2010, ISO/IEC 1539-1:2010/Cor 1:2012, and ISO/IEC 1539-1:2010/Cor 2:2013. The purpose of this Technical Speciﬁcation is to promote portability, reliability, maintainability, and ef-ﬁcient execution of parallel programs written in Fortran, for use on a variety of computing systems.
    ISO/IEC TS 18508:2015 does not specify formal data consistency model. Developing the formal data consist-ency model is left until the integration of these facilities into ISO/IEC 1539-1.
