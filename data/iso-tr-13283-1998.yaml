  content: This Technical Report identifies user requirements for systems supporting
    time-critical communications systems and the network management aspect which are
    specific to time-critical communications architecture in peer-to-peer and multipeer
    communications in or between application processes. This Technical Report translates
    user requirements for systems supporting time-critical communications into QoS
    requirements for the management and support of a time-critical communications
    network, using the concepts and terminology of the QoS Basic Framework developed
    by ISO/IEC JTC1/SC21/WG7. This Technical Report also describes a model, characteristics
    and functions for network management in time-critical communications systems.
    This Technical Report focuses on time-critical communications systems used in
    discrete parts manufacturing applications; however, these time-critical communications
    systems may also be used in other applications, including process control. This
    Technical Report concentrates primarily on time-critical communications systems
    for event-driven applications in which traffic flow and network configuration
    change dynamically; however, this Technical Report may also be applicable to state-driven
    applications in which traffic patterns and configuration are static.
