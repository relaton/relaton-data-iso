abstract:
- content: "This document describes the performance characteristics and minimum performance
    criteria which should be taken into account when conducting a single-laboratory
    validation study for qualitative (binary) real-time polymerase chain reaction
    (PCR) methods applied for the detection of specific DNA sequences present in foods.
    \n\nThe protocol was developed for qualitative real-time PCR methods for the detection
    of DNA sequences derived from genetically modified foodstuffs. It is applicable
    also for single-laboratory validation of qualitative PCR methods used for analysis
    of other food materials, e.g. for species detection and identification. \nThe
    document does not cover the evaluation of the applicability and the practicability
    with respect to the specific scope of the PCR method."
