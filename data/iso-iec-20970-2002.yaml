    This International Standard can be used with benefits on all kinds of platform.
    This International Standard's most immediate interest is for deploying portable applications
    on small footprint devices. This International Standard provides dramatic savings of
    dynamic memory and execution time without sacrificing any of the flexibility usually attached
    to the use of non-pre-linked portable code.
    This International Standard is especially important to provide a complete solution to execute
    portable programs of which code size is bigger than the available dynamic memory.
    This International Standard is also very important when fast reactivity of programs is
    important. By avoiding the extra-processing related to loading into dynamic memory and
    formatting classes at runtime, this International Standard provides a complete answer to the
    problem of class-loading slow-down.
    These benefits are particularly interesting for small devices supporting financial applications.
    Such applications are often complex and relying on code of significant size, while the
    pressure of the market often imposes to these devices to be of a low price and,
    consequently, to be very small footprint platforms. In addition, to not impose unacceptable
    delays to customers, it is important these applications do not waste time in loading classes
    into dynamic memory when they are launched but, on the contrary, to be immediately
    actively processing the transaction with no delay. When using smart cards, there are also
    some loose real-time constraints that are better handled if it can be granted that no
    temporary freezing of processing can occur due to class loading.
    This International Standard can also be of great benefit for devices dealing with real-time
    applications. In this case, avoiding the delays due to class loading can play an important
    role to satisfy real-time constraints.
