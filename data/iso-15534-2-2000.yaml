    This part of ISO 15534 specifies the dimensions of openings for access into machinery as defined in
    ISO/TR 12100-1. It provides the dimensions to which the values given in ISO 15534-3 are applicable. Values for
    additional space requirements are given in annex A. This part of ISO 15534 has been prepared primarily for nonmobile
    machinery; there may be additional specific requirements for mobile machinery.
    Dimensions for access openings are based on the values for the 95th percentile, whereas reach distances are
    based on the values for the 5th percentile, in each case the least favourable body dimension of the expected user
    population being used as a basis. The same considerations apply to the location of access openings.
    The anthropometric data given in ISO 15534-3 originate from static measurements of nude persons and do not
    take into account body movements, clothing, equipment, machinery-operating conditions or environmental
    conditions.
    This part of ISO 15534 shows how to combine the anthropometric data with suitable allowances to take these
    factors into account.
    Situations where people are to be prevented from reaching a hazard are dealt with in ISO 13852.
