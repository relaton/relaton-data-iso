  content: 'For taking the phosphorus into solution the following two methods are
    specified: The carbonaceous material is removed by ashing in amuffle furnace under
    specified conditions and the phosphorus is extracted by treatment with hydrofluoric
    and sulphuric acids. The carbonaceous material is removed by repeated oxidation
    with nitric acid in the presence of sulphuric acid. The determination is carried
    out by adding ammonium molybdate and ascorbic acid solution and measuring the
    absorbance of the resulting blue solution by a siutable optical instrument.'
