- content: |-
    This document specifies requirements for ensuring the quality and safety of the design and manufacture of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) that include unmanned aircraft (UA), remote pilot stations (RPS), datalinks, payloads, and associated support equipment.
    This document includes information regarding the unmanned aircraft, any associated remote pilot station (RPS)(s), the command and control links (C2 Link), any other required data links (e.g. payload, traffic management information, vehicle identification) and any other system elements as can be required. This document does not cover passenger carrying UAS or technical requirements for the design and manufacturing for UAS components.
    This document does not include equipment considerations unique to compliance with UA traffic management systems.
    The document is applicable to the reasonable expected use of a UAS.
    This document is applicable:
    a) to UAS designed for use where a State aviation authority has determined a Certificate of Airworthiness (C of A) is not required;
    b) where a C of A is required, to complement technical standards published by the aviation authority for the purposes of building the certification basis; or
    c) as an alternative means of compliance if acceptable to the aviation authority.
