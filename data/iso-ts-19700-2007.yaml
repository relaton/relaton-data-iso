  content: "ISO/TS 19700:2007 describes a tube-furnace method for the generation of
    fire effluent for the identification and measurement of its constituent combustion
    products, in particular, the yields of toxic products under a range of fire decomposition
    conditions. \nThe test method described in ISO/TS 19700:2007 can be used solely
    to measure and describe the properties of materials, products or systems in response
    to heat or flame under controlled laboratory conditions. It is not suitable to
    be used by itself for describing or appraising the fire hazard of materials, products
    or systems under actual fire conditions, or as the sole source on which regulations
    pertaining to toxicity can be based. "
