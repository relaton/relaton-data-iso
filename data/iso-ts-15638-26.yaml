abstract:
- content: "The ISO 15638 series (Parts 1 to 25) define the framework for online fleet
    management of regulated/unregulated commercial freight vehicles utilizing data
    communication between in-vehicle systems and an application service provider via
    an on-board communication unit interfacing with road monitoring infrastructure
    and roadside sensors. This document defines an unregulated service architecture
    framework for freight vehicle dynamic electric charging information collecting
    architecture. This statement does not preclude the regulated service where road
    authority requires such a function.\nThe objective of this document is to provide
    a freight vehicle dynamic charging information collecting service function/application
    for non-enforcement applications [and sometimes for regulated application service
    (RAS)]. This is for the road transport decarbonizing management purposes of regulated
    commercial freight vehicle movements by using battery powered heavy electric vehicles.
    \nThis document intends to reinforce vehicle energy efficiency for non-enforcement
    and other purposes by collecting dynamic charging information of battery powered
    heavy electric vehicles. Collected information can be used for fee collection,
    energy management purposes which are outside of this standard. The static charging
    information exchange application standards have been created by other standardization
    body such as TC22/SC31, which is not applicable to this standard. This standard
    covers only on dynamic charging applications. The information exchange such as
    charging right, and payment authorization purposes are outside of this standard.\nThis
    document defines the framework for remote energy consumption information collecting
    for non-enforcement and other management purpose applications conceptual operation.\nThis
    document is complementary to, and does not replace, any other documents in the
    ISO 15638 series. This document is beneficial to vehicle energy efficient management
    purpose entities, and it provides additional use cases for TARV service applications.\nThis
    document is specifically oriented towards the realization of efficient road transport
    of freight vehicles by collecting dynamic charging status information from the
    vehicle to the service provider. It utilizes the ISO 15638 series basic architecture
    framework defined in ISO 15638-21. The service provider provides users with energy
    consumption information of battery powered heavy electric vehicle and gives user
    the information required to perform charging fee collections, as necessary. The
    various V2X communication paths can be used according to the various use cases."
