    ISO 27769-2:2009 specifies the manufacturing property requirements for wet-process fibreboard.
    NOTE          The values listed in ISO 27769-2:2009 relate to product properties used to classify fibreboards into one of the different types. The values are not characteristic values to be used for design purposes. When fibreboard is classified as load-bearing and nominated for structural applications, characteristic strength and stiffness values are established based upon testing in accordance with ISO 16572 or equivalent ASTM or EN Standards. Alternatively, for specific load-bearing applications (e.g. walls, roofs, floors and I-joist webs), the load-bearing fibreboard would meet the specific performance requirements for that intended application.
