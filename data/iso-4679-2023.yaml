abstract:
- content: "This document specifies the measurement and acceptance criteria and the
    test report of hydraulic performance tests for waterjet propulsion system of Class
    A and Class B. \nThe test methods for the waterjet propulsion pump with and without
    the inlet duct are both specified. This document is applicable to the hydraulic
    performance test of water jet propulsion under the specified test conditions.
    This document specifies the precision grade of Class A for hydraulic model tests
    of water jet propulsion and Class B for acceptance tests of small and middle-sized
    or intermediate test models.\nIn addition, this document specifies the test conditions
    of Class A and Class B, and recommendations and requirements for test equipment
    to ensure that the test can be carried out under the conditions of corresponding
    accuracy.\nThis document does not include miscellaneous parts of waterjet unit,
    such as steering and reversing gear, hydraulic system and control system. "
