  content: The limit of determination is approximately 50 micro-gram/kg. The method
    consists in extracting of a test portion with a mixture of acetonitrile and potassium
    chloride solution, filtrating, defatting, purifying, filtrating again, extracting
    into chloroform which is subsequently evaporated. Dissolution of the dry extract
    in a mixture of benzene and acetonitrile and thin layer chromatography. Determination
    by visual measurement or by measurement of the intensity of fluorescence under
    UV ligt by comparison with known quantities of zearalenone applied to the same
    plate. Confirmation using bis-diazotized benzidine reagent.
