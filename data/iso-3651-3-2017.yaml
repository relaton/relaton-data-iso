    ISO 3651-3:2017 specifies the determination of the intergranular corrosion susceptibility of low-Cr [less than 16 % Cr, less than 0,3 % Ni, less than 0,3 % Ti and less than 0,3 % Nb, less than 0,3 % (Ti + Atomic weight ratio Nb)] ferritic stainless steels in the 0,5 % sulfuric acid/copper sulfate test. It also specifies the purposes which may be assigned to the test.
    The method is applicable to stainless steels supplied in the form of rolled sheets and welded tubes and intended for use in a mildly oxidizing acid medium.
    It is important to note that the result of the corrosion test is only strictly valid for the corrosive medium used in the test. It constitutes a basis for estimating the resistance to intergranular corrosion but cannot be used to check resistance to other forms of corrosion (general corrosion, pitting, stress corrosion, etc.). It is important for the user to adapt the specified corrosion test where steels are used. This test is, in no case, considered as an absolute criterion of the quality of the metal.
