    For the purposes of this International Standard, a portable computer is defined as a computer with a screen and an
    attached keyboard that is capable of running on battery power for extended periods of time and is relatively easy to
    transport from one location to another by a single individual.
    This International Standard gives design guidance for product designers; this International Standard indicates those
    requirements and recommendations contained in ISO/IEC 9995 and ISO 9241-4:1998 that are to be considered in
    designing portable computers keyboards.
    This International Standard strives to maintain consistency, as far as practical, between keyboards for portable
    computers and desktop computers. To accomplish this goal, this International Standard has reviewed ISO/IEC 9995
    and ISO 9241-4:1998 to identify those design features of these two base standards which are to be followed, which
    are exempted from this International Standard and which are permitted variations.
    This International Standard is intended primarily to apply to full size portable keyboards (e.g. A4). It may also apply
    to other keyboards outside this scope. ISO 9241-4 contains a proposed alternative method for conformance by a
    test based on user performance and subjective rating scales.
    This International Standard consists of two major categories of guidelines for portable computers:
    1. Layout characteristics
    2. Physical (ergonomic) characteristics
