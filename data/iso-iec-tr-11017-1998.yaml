  content: "This Technical Report presents the framework and recommended model for
    internationalization and identifies the Services required for the internationalization
    of information technology. \nThis Technical Report: \n- discusses the requirements
    of internationalized Systems and their users,\n- suggests a concerted, unified
    approach to internationalization,\n- recommends Services to fulfil the requirements,
    and lists the Standards related to the Services. \nThis Technical Report is intended
    to be a reference for future Standards on the internationalization of information
    technology, to act as a communication vehicle between those who provide Standards
    and those who request them, and also to function as a basis for all future ISO/IEC
    JTC l/SC 22NVG 20 activities. \nNOTE 1 This Technical Report does not propose
    any specific solutions for internationalization. Future Standards are expected
    to provide the solutions, reflecting the directions in this Technical Report.
    \nNOTE 2 Internationalization Services consist of internationally generic Services
    and nationally specific information (data). This Technical Report covers only
    the internationally generic Portion of Software, so it does not discuss: - preparation
    of internationalized information technology Systems for localization by a local
    User. - hardware-related issues or requirements. - requirements related to System
    ergonomics.\n NOTE 3 The internationalization solutions and Services available
    in the mid-late 1980s are the technical basis for this Technical Report."
