abstract:
- content: The method specified (using a pH-meter) is applicable to all types of water
    and waste water samples in the range from pH 3 to pH 10. The temperature, some
    gases and organic materials interfere with the pH-measurement. Suspended materials
    in the sample may cause significant errors. When measuring sewage and some surface
    waters, there is a particularly high risk of smearing the electrodes or contaminating
    the membranes and diaphragm with oil, grease or other contaminants.
