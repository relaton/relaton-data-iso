- content: |-
    ISO 12647-3:2013 specifies a number of process parameters and their values to be applied when producing colour separations and printing forms for newspaper single or four-colour printing. The parameters and values are chosen in consideration of the process, covering the process stages: "colour separation", "making of the printing formed", "OK print or proof" and "production printing".
    ISO 12647-3:2013 is intended to enhance communication between printers, publishers and advertisers and to make print buyers aware of the expected printed result in advance, enabling them to plan accordingly. ISO 12647-3:2013 defines tolerances, allowing for objective quality evaluations and raising the competitiveness of newspapers compared to other media.
    ISO 12647-3:2013 is applicable:
    to coldset offset production printing on newsprint that use colour separation data;
    by analogy to press printing from printing surfaces produced by direct imaging;
    to line screens and non-periodic screens, parameters given can be applied by analogy.
