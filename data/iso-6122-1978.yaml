abstract:
- content: A test portion is dispersed in a sodium sulphate solution, and mixture
    of butan-l-ol and acetons is added to precipitate sodium sulphate decahydrate
    and part of sodium chloride. A mixture of alkane sulphonates (mono + di), which
    may be contiminated by a little sodium chloride is obtained by filtration. The
    solvent is evaporated so that the small quantities of paraffins are eliminated.
    The alkane sulphonates content is determined gravimetrically and any sodium chloride
    present is determined potentiometrically.
