abstract:
- content: The classification is intended to provide a clear and logical designation
    of the structural chemical groups of a surface active agent, in the form of a
    decimal notation. Its aim is to describe a surface active agent according to its
    chemical formula. The subdivision of the classification is, however, not taken
    far enough to enable one classification index number to be considered as necessarily
    corresponding to a specific product. The classification index number would enable
    to reconstruct a molecular structure which is approximate but nevertheless sufficiently
    precise.
