    This document provides region-specific information for:
    —    local submissions and approvals for vascular device-drug combination products (VDDCPs) in countries and regions around the world;
    —    changes related to the drug-containing part and how they are evaluated by different local regions.
    For implanted products, this document is considered as a supplement to ISO 14630, which specifies general requirements for the performance of non-active surgical implants.
    This document is considered also as a supplement to ISO 12417-1, and any relevant device-specific standards, such as the ISO 25539 series specifying requirements for endovascular devices. This document also addresses VDDCPs that are not necessarily permanent implants.
