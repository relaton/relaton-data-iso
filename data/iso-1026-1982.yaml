  content: The method of determination of dry matter content consists in heating to
    constant mass, after mixing, of liquid or semi-liquid products spread over an
    absobent surface, or of pasty products mixed with an inert powder, at 70 °C under
    reduced pressure. The method of determin of water content consists in entraining
    of the water in the form of vapour by a volatile solvent immiscible with water,
    condensing and separating in a reflux trap, recovering and measuring of the volume
    of water in a graduated tube.
