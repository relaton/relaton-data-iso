  content: "Scope of the proposed deliverable\n\nThis document specifies a procedure
    for the determination of dynamic viscosity (η) and density (ρ) for the calculation
    of kinematic viscosity (ν) of middle distillate fuels, fatty acid methyl ester
    fuels (FAME) and mixtures of these with middle distillate fuels, and lubricating
    oils including base oils, formulated oils, and synthetics, using a constant pressure
    viscometer. The range of kinematic viscosities covered in this test method is
    from 0,5 mm2/s to 2 000 mm2/s, with precision at 40 °C from 0,9 mm2/s to 1 300
    mm2/s, and precision at 100 °C from 2.9 mm2/s to 161 mm2/s. \nThe result obtained
    using the procedure described in this document depends on the rheological behaviour
    of the sample. This document is predominantly applicable to liquids whose shear
    stress and shear rate are proportional (Newtonian flow behaviour). However, if
    the viscosity changes significantly with the shear rate, comparison with other
    measuring methods is only permissible at similar shear rates"
