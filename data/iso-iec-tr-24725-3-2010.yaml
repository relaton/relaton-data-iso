- content: 'ISO/IEC TR 24725-3:2010 provides standardized vocabulary, taxonomy of
    media and platform technologies, and a process that can be used to describe different
    combinations or bundles of media and platform technologies, which are needed to
    perform identified functions or to support a class of applications for learners
    within or across various information technology environments. It provides examples
    of how and when bundles of technologies can be defined to support learning, education
    and training activities. '
