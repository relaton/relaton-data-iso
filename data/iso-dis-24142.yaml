    This document specifies safety aspects for the design of machinery used for production of formulated feed in feed processing mills. Relevant hazards are identified with recommended solutions so as to provide the best options for the safe design during the life cycle of the machine types identified. Existing standards for safe machine design are not duplicated as machinery use for the production of feed for animals has been significantly addressed by other industries. Significant hazards that are unique to machinery found in feed mills and feed processing facilities are addressed in this standard. Excluded from this standard are explosive environment; noise testing; and hazards not inherent to the design of the machines typically found in feed mills.
    This document excludes machinery intended for liquid feed, and wet and semi-moist pet foods. This document excludes machinery intended for the processing of food for human consumption. This document is not applicable to machinery intended for feed processing mills manufactured before the date of its publication.
