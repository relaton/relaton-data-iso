- content: |-
    ISO/TR 25743:2010 investigates and highlights the main risks associated with using lifts (elevators) for the evacuation of persons in various types of emergency.
    The types of emergency under study arise from fire, flood, earthquake, explosion, biological or chemical attack, gas leakage, lightning or storm damage in the building being studied or a building adjacent to it.
    The purpose of ISO/TR 25743:2010 is to provide a process for making decisions relevant to the design of lifts and buildings, in order to determine if a given design can enable the lifts involved to be used with an acceptable level of safety.
