    This document gives guidelines for organizations on how to prevent or control exposure to infectious agents at the workplace and manage the risks associated with infectious diseases that:
    —    present a risk of severe ill health or death and can impact the health, safety and well-being of workers and other relevant interested parties;
    —    present a lower risk to health yet have a significant impact on the organization, its workers and other relevant interested parties.
    This document is applicable to organizations of all sizes and sectors.
    NOTE       This document does not provide comprehensive guidance to those parts of an organization that implement mandated infection controls such as hospitals and medical or biological laboratories because there is an inherent potential for exposure to infectious diseases. Applicable legislation and guidance are provided by government, regulators and health authorities for specific infection controls for the protection of workers in such settings and for work activities on or with pathogenic microorganisms.
