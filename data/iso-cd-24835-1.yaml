  content: This document establishes the methods and principles, instruments, sampling,
    composition analysis, calculation and result reporting requirements and procedures
    for the calculation of shale brittleness index based on X-ray diffraction method
    for determining the shale mineral characteristics. This document is applicable
    to the testing and calculation of shale brittleness index in the assessment of
    reservoirs and selection of areas for marine shale gas exploration and development.
