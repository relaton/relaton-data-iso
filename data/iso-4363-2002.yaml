    ISO 4363:2002 specifies conventional and simplified methods for the measurement of cross-sectional mean suspended sediment mass concentration and mean particle size distribution. The conventional method is used for routine measurements in periods of stable or slowly varied flow. The simplified method is mainly used for sediment measurements for the purpose of observing the variation process of sediment transport and can be performed under difficult conditions. Empirical relationships are established between the cross-sectional mean suspended sediment mass concentrations and mean particle size distributions measured by conventional and simplified methods.
    The methods specified in ISO 4363:2002 are applicable to suspended sediment measurements at hydrological stations.
