abstract:
- content: Filters are graded according to their pore size index in one of the eight
    classes specified. This is applicable to laboratory filters made of glass, vitreous
    silica, ceramics, metals and plastic materials. Annex A specifies a method for
    determination of pore size index. Annex B and C concern with a procedure for assessing
    uniformity of filters and for determination of air permeability.
