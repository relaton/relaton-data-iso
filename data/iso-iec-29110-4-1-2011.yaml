  content: "ISO/IEC 29110-4-1:2011 is applicable to Very Small Entities (VSEs). A
    Very Small Entity (VSE) is defined as an enterprise, organization, department
    or project having up to 25 people. A set of standards and guides have been developed
    according to a set of VSEs' characteristics and needs. The guides are based on
    subsets of appropriate standards elements, referred to as VSE profiles. The purpose
    of a VSE profile is to define a subset of International Standards relevant to
    the VSE context.\nISO/IEC 29110 is targeted by audience. ISO/IEC 29110-4 is targeted
    for standards producers, tool vendors and methodology vendors. It is not intended
    for VSEs. ISO/IEC 29110-4-m provides the specification for all the profiles in
    a profile group that are based on subsets of appropriate standards elements. If
    a new profile is needed, a Part 4-m can be developed without impacting existing
    documents. \nISO/IEC 29110-4-1:2011 provides a profile specification for the Basic
    VSE profile within the Generic profile group. The Generic profile group is applicable
    to VSEs that do not develop critical software. The Generic profile group does
    not imply any specific application domain.\nThe Basic VSE profile selects ISO/IEC
    12207 project management and software implementation process elements and ISO/IEC
    15289 products from the single project perspective. Its purpose is to provide
    the normative and informative links to the subset of ISO/IEC 12207 and ISO/IEC
    15289."
