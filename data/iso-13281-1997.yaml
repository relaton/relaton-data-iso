- content: 'The document specifies the functional architecture of MAPLE, a Manufacturing
    Automation Programming Environment. MAPLE is a vendor-independent neutral facility
    for the programming of multiple manufacturing devices and controls. For the programming
    of manufacturing devices and controls the following areas will be supported: Connection
    between various manufacturing data and manufacturing application programs; management
    of several manufacturing databases; sharing of manufacturing application programs
    and software tools.'
