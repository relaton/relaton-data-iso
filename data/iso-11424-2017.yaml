    ISO 11424:2017 specifies requirements for rubber hoses and tubing for use in the various air and vacuum systems found on internal combustion engines. This document does not cover hoses used for direct power-brake actuation in trucks and trailers, nor for air intakes and ducting within the passenger compartment. The highest-temperature hoses are generally used for turbocharger applications. All hoses and tubing remain serviceable down to −40°C.
    NOTE          Although the term vacuum is generally used, in reality the application is one of reduced air pressure used for the purposes of actuation or monitoring of the various engine-system components. The air carried by the tubing or hoses may be clean and free of contaminants but may also contain oil, fuel and their vapours as contamination, due to the particular installation and application.
