    ISO 1464:2018 specifies the minimum clear space to be provided beneath the aircraft main jacking points, in order to accommodate tripod jacks and thus ensure adequate clearance between the jacks and the adjacent aircraft structure.
    ISO 1464:2018 is not intended to define fully all jack clearance dimensions. In situations where clearances are critical, it is used as a design aid only. Final critical clearances are established by using actual jack dimensions.
