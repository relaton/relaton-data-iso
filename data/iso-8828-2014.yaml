    ISO 8828:2014 specifies the recommended procedures for handling orthopaedic implants, hereafter referred to as implants, from receipt at the hospital until they are implanted or discarded.
    This guidance applies to implants (such as currently used metal, ceramic, or polymeric implants) and also to acrylic resin and other bone cements.
    This guidance does not apply to the implant manufacturer. However, it contains references to the stocking of implants that can be useful for manufacturers and especially for third-party suppliers.
