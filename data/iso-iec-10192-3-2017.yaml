  content: ISO/IEC 10192-3:2017(E) this part of ISO/IEC 10192 specifies a Universal
    Communication Module (UCM) that transfers energy management data via a home network
    between an end device and an energy management agent (specified in ISO/IEC 15067-3)
    or an energy service provider. This document specifies the mechanical, electrical
    and logical characteristics of the interfaces of UCM to an end device and a choice
    of interfaces to a home communications network.
