abstract:
- content: "For factory made, residential, commercial and industrial, electrically
    operated compression, air-to-air air-conditioners and air-to-air heat pumps above
    12kW, described as variable refrigerant  flow systems, this document specifies:\n-\tperformance
    testing, the standard conditions and the test methods for determining the capacity
    and efficiency ratings under heating and cooling, and\n-\tcalculation methods
    for seasonal performance.  \n\nThis standard does not apply to\n\na)\tRating and
    testing of individual assemblies, such as condensing units or coils, for separate
    use\nb)\tMulti-split Systems where each Indoor Unit has dedicated piping connected
    directly to the Outdoor Unit.\nc)\tSingle or variable speed water source heat–pump
    systems."
