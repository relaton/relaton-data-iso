    ISO 13623:2009 specifies requirements and gives recommendations for the design, materials, construction, testing, operation, maintenance and abandonment of pipeline systems used for transportation in the petroleum and natural gas industries.
    ISO 13623:2009 applies to pipeline systems on land and offshore, connecting wells, production plants, process plants, refineries and storage facilities, including any section of a pipeline constructed within the boundaries of such facilities for the purpose of its connection. A figure shows the extent of pipeline systems covered by ISO 13623:2009.
    ISO 13623:2009 applies to rigid, metallic pipelines. It is not applicable for flexible pipelines or those constructed from other materials, such as glass-reinforced plastics.
    ISO 13623:2009 is applicable to all new pipeline systems and can be applied to modifications made to existing ones. It is not intended that it apply retroactively to existing pipeline systems.
    ISO 13623:2009 describes the functional requirements of pipeline systems and provides a basis for their safe design, construction, testing, operation, maintenance and abandonment.
