    This document sets and defines the minimum requirements for registration of data acquired from process monitoring and for quality control in additive manufacturing (AM), including the description of a procedure.
    Furthermore, this document comprises actions that users shall execute to register multi-modal AM data and store them in an appropriate repository.
    This document is not applicable for data cleansing, sensor calibration, and image processing.
    This document is only applicable for data gathered and generated from non-destructive test methods and sensors, e.g. X-ray computer tomography (XCT), thermal sensor, cameras and coordinate measuring machines (CMM).
    This document is only applicable to metallic parts produced by means of laser-based powder bed fusion (PBF-LB); nevertheless, the procedures described in this document can be applied to monitor other AM processes and materials (e.g. directed energy deposition, polymer or ceramic powder bed fusion, binder jetting, and photopolymerization), but this document does not provide any data or case studies for them.
