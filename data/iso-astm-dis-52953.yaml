    This document sets and defines the minimum requirements for registration of geometric data acquired from process-monitoring and for quality control in Additive Manufacturing (AM), including the description of a procedure.

    Furthermore, this document comprises actions that users need to register multi-modal AM data and store them in an appropriate repository.

    This document is not applicable for the following types of data: data cleansing, image processing, cost, production time and personnel.

    This document in only applicable for geometric data gathered and generated from non-destructive test methods and sensors by using X-ray Computer Tomography (XCT), cameras and Coordinate Measuring Machines (CMM).

    This document is only applicable to metals produced through means of Laser-based powder bed fusion (PBF-LB) and Direct Energy Deposition (DED).

    Note: The procedure can be applied to monitor other AM processes and materials (e.g. polymer or ceramic power bed fusion, binder jetting, and photopolymerization), but this document does not provide any data or case studies for them.
