  content: Establishes methods for determining the thermal performance of glazed liquid
    heating solar collectors; provides test methods and calculation procedures for
    determining the steady-state and quasi-steady-state thermal performance of solar
    collectors. Contains methods for conducting tests outdoors under natural solar
    irradiance and indoors under simulated solar irradiance. Not applicable to those
    collectors in which the thermal storage unit is an integral part of the collector
    to such an extent that the collection process cannot be separated for the purpose
    of making measurements of these two processes. Also not applicable to unglazed
    solar collectors nor is it applicable to tracking concentrating solar collectors.
