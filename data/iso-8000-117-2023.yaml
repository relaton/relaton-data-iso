    This document specifies requirements for using identifiers in distributed ledgers including blockchains. These requirements supplement those of ISO 8000-115.
    The following are within the scope of this document:
    —     requirements for each identifier in distributed ledgers including blockchains, where the ledger enables supply chains to exchange transaction data;
    —     requirements for the off‑ledger data set that is referenced by an identifier in a distributed ledger;
    —     off-ledger data sets that consist only of property-value tuples, where each tuple is the result of semantic encoding.
    The following are outside the scope of this document:
    —     requirements for implementing distributed ledger technology including blockchains;
    —     requirements for technology to ensure immutability of data sets;
    —     requirements for the processes of creating identifiers;
    —     requirements for the processes of creating the content of off‑ledger data sets;
    —     requirements for the processes of creating immutable data sets.
