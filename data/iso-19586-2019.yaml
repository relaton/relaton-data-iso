- content: |-
    This document specifies a method for comparing simulation results from a vehicle model to measured test data for an existing vehicle combination's lateral stability according to driving tests as specified in ISO 14791. The comparison is made for the purpose of validating the simulation model for this type of test. A complete validation comprises the comparison for at least one tested vehicle and one variant of this vehicle, covered by a parameter variation in the vehicle model.
    The document applies to heavy vehicles, including commercial vehicles, commercial vehicle combinations, buses and articulated buses as defined in ISO 3833 (trucks and trailers with maximum weight above 3,5 tonnes and buses and articulated buses with maximum weight above 5 tonnes, according to ECE and EC vehicle classification, categories M3, N2, N3, O3 and O4).
