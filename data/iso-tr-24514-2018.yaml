abstract:
- content: This document provides several examples of varying complexity which illustrate
    the use and intent of the performance assessment methodology set out in ISO 24510,
    ISO 24511 and ISO 24512. The document also provides examples of the parallel and
    similar practices for measuring performance or establishing benchmarks as found
    in various institutional circumstances. These examples represent practices in
    a range of utilities (e.g. small, medium and large water utilities; water utilities
    from developed and developing countries; water utilities in both the public and
    private sectors; government and non-governmental agencies; and utilities with
    and without certified management systems). They are drawn from many geographical
    locations.
