  content: "ISO/IEC TR 20000-3:2009 provides guidance on scope definition, applicability
    and demonstration of conformance for service providers aiming to meet the requirements
    of ISO/IEC 20000-1, or for service providers who are planning service improvements
    and intending to use ISO/IEC 20000 as a business goal. It can also assist service
    providers who are considering using ISO/IEC 20000-1 for implementing a service
    management system (SMS) and who need specific advice on whether ISO/IEC 20000-1
    is applicable to their circumstances and how to define the scope of their SMS.\nISO/IEC
    TR 20000-3:2009 supplements the advice in ISO/IEC 20000-2, which provides generic
    guidelines for implementing an SMS in accordance with ISO/IEC 20000-1. \nService
    providers who wish to implement an SMS based on ISO/IEC 20000-1 are required to
    define the scope of their SMS. Most service providers are dependent on a complex
    supply chain for the delivery of the overall service. Most service providers provide
    a range of services to several different types of customer. This makes the definition
    of service management scope, and the agreement of the scope statement, a complex
    stage in the service provider's adoption of ISO/IEC 20000. ISO/IEC TR 20000-3:2009
    provides guidance on the applicability of ISO/IEC 20000-1 and scope of the SMS
    based on practical examples.\nISO/IEC TR 20000-3:2009 takes the form of explanations,
    guidance and recommendations. It provides practical examples of the scope statements
    to service providers, irrespective of whether they have any previous experience
    with other management system standards."
