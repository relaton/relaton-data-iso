    ISO/PAS 21308-1:2007 describes general principles for the exchange of data between truck chassis manufacturers and bodywork manufacturers. It applies to commercial vehicles as defined in ISO 3833, having a maximum gross vehicle mass greater than 3 500 kg.
    The process of exchanging product data can involve
    -        chassis manufacturer,
    -        chassis importer,
    -        chassis dealer,
    -        one or more bodywork manufacturers, and
    -        bodywork component suppliers, e.g. manufacturers of demountable bodies, cranes and loading equipment and tipping equipment.
    ISO/PAS 21308-1:2007 provides an overview and recommendations to assist the parties implementing BEP codes for their communication process. The recommendations cover different ways of communicating and presenting the BEP codes. ISO/PAS 21308-1:2007 also contains some examples of experience from practical use.
