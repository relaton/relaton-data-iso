    This document specifies the engineering method for the measurement of sound pressure levels in rooms from specific service equipment or activities in buildings.
    This document covers measurements of sound from sanitary installations, mechanical ventilation, heating and cooling service equipment, lifts, rubbish chutes, heating devices, blowers, pumps and other auxiliary service equipment, and motor driven car park doors. It can also be applied to measurements of sounds from other types of equipment or activities in this building, e.g. noise from sport facilities, pubs etcetera. The measurement of noise from external sound sources generating air-borne or ground-borne noise are not included in this document.
    The operating conditions and operating cycles given in Annex B shall be used except if there are guidelines in national requirements and regulations which shall then be applied instead of the guidelines in Annex B.
    The methods are suitable for rooms with volumes of approximately 300 m3 or less e.g. in dwellings, hotels, schools, offices and hospitals. The standard is not intended for measurements in large auditoriums, office landscapes or concert halls. However, the operating conditions and operating cycles in Annex B can be used complementary to other methods in such cases.
    The service equipment sound pressure level is determined as the maximum A-weighted and optionally C-weighted sound pressure level occurring during a specified operation cycle of the service equipment under test, or as the equivalent continuous sound pressure level in one–third–octave–bands determined with a specified integration time. A-weighted and C-weighted single number values shall be calculated from one–third–octave–band measurements corrected for background noise and reverberation times.
