  content: Specifies methods of test for natural and synthetic materials having a
    molar ratio sodium fluoride/aluminium trifluoride between 3 and 1,7 approximately.
    The method is applicable to products the phosphorus pentoxide content of which
    does not exceed 0,02 % (m/m). The procedure consists in alkaline fusion of a test
    portion by means of a mixture of sodium carbonate and boric acid. Dissolution
    of the fused mass in excess nitric acid so that the pH value is between 0,7 and
    0,9. Formation of the (Yellow) oxidized molybdosilicate under clearly defined
    conditions of acidity, temperature, time and concentration of reagents. Selective
    reduction in the presence of tartaric acid and measurement at a wvelength of about
    815 nm.
