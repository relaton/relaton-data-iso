abstract:
- content: "This document specifies minimum requirements for pressure relief devices
    intended for use on hydrogen fuelled vehicle fuel containers that comply with
    ISO 19881, IEC 62282-4-101, CSA/ANSI HGV 2, EC79/EU406, SAE J2579, UN ECE R134,
    or the UN GTR No. 13.\nThe applicability of this document is limited to thermally
    activated pressure relief devices installed on fuel containers containing gaseous
    hydrogen according to ISO 14687 for fuel cell and internal combustion land vehicles.
    This document specifies requirements for thermally activated pressure relief devices
    acceptable for use on-board the following types of land vehicles:\n—         
    light-duty vehicles; \n—          heavy-duty vehicles;\n—          industrial
    powered trucks, such as forklifts and other material handling vehicles. \nRequirements
    for other types of land vehicles such as rail, off-road, etc., can be derived
    with due consideration of appropriate service conditions.\nThis document does
    not apply to reseating, resealing, or pressure-activated devices.\nPressure relief
    devices can be of any design or manufacturing method that meets the requirements
    of this document."
