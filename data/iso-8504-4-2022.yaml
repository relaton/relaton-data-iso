    This document describes the typical method for acid pickling generally used in a shop facility for the preparation of steel substrates before application of paints and related products. It is in general applicable to new steelwork.
    This method is essentially intended to remove rust and mill scale. Typically, only slight oil residues can be removed during this process. It can be used on steel surfaces that are easily deformed by abrasive blasting.
