abstract:
- content: Numbers of FIB applications will soon be available with developments and
    advancements of FIB instruments including, in-line automatic operation, multiple
    sample preparation, in-situ lift-out, new ion sources and cryogenic, which are
    still in their infancy. The manufacturers/vendors pertaining to this field have
    technical characteristics to offer their unique features in terms of instrument
    technology. Due to such conditions, entities to be newly involved in this technical
    field are anticipated to increase, and there exists a risk of random development
    of technologies exploiting the essence of FIB. In the light of the situation where
    several different words are used for the same function of FIB, this standard defines
    unified terminology necessary to the FIB processing
