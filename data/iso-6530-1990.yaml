  content: Defines the characteristics of resistance of clothing, the test method
    for their assessment, the marking requirements. Such clothing is for use in operations
    with chemicals in industry, agriculture and laboratories. The purpose is to provide
    protection against occasional exposure to droplets or small drops, a brief exposure
    to a low pressure jet or a splash. Finally it is emphasized that the protection
    may be reduced by normal wear and tear and will probably become non-existent when
    the clothing is wet.
