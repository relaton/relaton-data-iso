abstract:
- content: |-
    ISO/IEC 30107-3:2017 establishes:
    -      principles and methods for performance assessment of presentation attack detection mechanisms;
    -      reporting of testing results from evaluations of presentation attack detection mechanisms;
    -      a classification of known attack types (in an informative annex).
    Outside the scope are:
    -      standardization of specific PAD mechanisms;
    -      detailed information about countermeasures (i.e. anti-spoofing techniques), algorithms, or sensors;
    -      overall system-level security or vulnerability assessment.
    The attacks considered in this document take place at the sensor during presentation. Any other attacks are considered outside the scope of this document.
