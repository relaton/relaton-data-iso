  content: 'Specifies the method of measuring the pressure drop across a fluid filter
    under various conditions of flow. Two standards of measurement are specified:
    class A - for accurate evaluation for referee purposes - requiring laboratory
    conditions; class B - for evaluation for general purposes - requiring test facilities
    less stringent that laboratory conditions. Figure 1 shows an example for a suitable
    test circuit, and the typical reporting method is given in the table.'
