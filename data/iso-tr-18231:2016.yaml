    ISO/TR 18231:2016 describes methods of test that can be applied to wavelength dispersive X-ray fluorescence (WD-XRF) spectrometers to ensure that the spectrometers are functioning in a manner that allows precise analyses to be made.
    The tests outlined are designed to measure the errors associated with the operation of certain parts of the spectrometer. They are not designed to check every part of the spectrometer but only those parts that may be the common sources of error.
    It is assumed that the performance of the instrument has been optimized according to the manufacturer's instructions. For all tests, the two-theta angle should be carefully set for the line being measured. The pulse height window should be set according to the manufacturer's instructions and should have a broad setting which may also include the escape peak for gas proportional counters. The instrument and detector gas environment should be as specified by the manufacturer, as should the power supply to the instrument.
    NOTE          Where no distinction has been made, it is assumed that a test is applicable to both sequential and simultaneous spectrometers.
