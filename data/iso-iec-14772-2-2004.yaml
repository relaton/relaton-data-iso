  content: "ISO/IEC 14772-1, the Virtual Reality Modeling Language (VRML), defines
    a file format that integrates 3D graphics and multimedia. Conceptually, each VRML
    file is a 3D time-based space that contains graphic and aural objects that can
    be dynamically modified through a variety of mechanisms. This part of ISO/IEC
    14772 defines the interface that applications external to the VRML browser may
    use to access and manipulate the objects defined in ISO/IEC 14772-1.\nThe interface
    described here is designed to allow an external environment to access nodes in
    a VRML scene using the existing VRML event model. In this model, an eventOut of
    a given node can be routed to an eventIn of another node. When the eventOut generates
    an event, the eventIn is notified and its node processes that event. Additionally,
    if a script in a Script node has a reference to a given node it can send events
    directly to any eventIn of that node and it can read the last value sent from
    any of its eventOuts. \nThe scope of this standard is to cover all forms of access
    to a VRML browser from external applications. It is equally valid for a database
    with a object interface to access a standalone browser in a presentation slide
    as it is for a Java applet operating within a web browser and the available services
    do not vary. \nThis standard does not provide a byte level protocol description
    as there can be many valid ways of expressing an interaction with a browser. Instead,
    it represents the interface in terms of the services provided and the parameters
    that are passed to access these services. Individual language and protocol bindings
    to these services are available as annexes to this part of ISO/IEC 14772. "
