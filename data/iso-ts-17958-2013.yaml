  content: |-
    ISO/TS 17958:2013 describes a method for determining the fracture toughness of paper and board using a tensile testing machine operated with a constant rate of elongation. ISO/TS 17958:2013 also describes the determination of the fracture strength and fracture strain of a notched paper web with an assigned standard web geometry. This information is used to rank the fracture properties of paper materials.
    ISO/TS 17958:2013 is applicable to all kinds of paper and paperboard, except for certain special grades, such as creped paper and other paper materials that significantly deviate from exhibiting monotonically decreasing tangential stiffness during tensile testing. ISO/TS 17958:2013 does not apply to corrugated fibreboard.
