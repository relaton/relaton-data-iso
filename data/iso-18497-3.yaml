  content: "This document specifies principles for the design of autonomous operating
    zones for agricultural machinery and tractors that are used in agricultural applications
    and that have partially automated, semi-autonomous and autonomous functions. Additionally,
    it provides guidance on the type of information, to be provided by the manufacturer,
    on safe working practices (including information about residual risks).\n\nThe
    purpose of this document is to assist in the provision of more specific safety
    requirements, means of verification and information for use to ensure an appropriate
    level of safety for agricultural machinery and tractors with partially automated,
    semi-autonomous and autonomous functions used in a specified way.\n\nThis document
    deals with all the significant hazards, hazardous situations and events, relevant
    to agricultural machinery and tractors with partially automated, semi-autonomous
    and autonomous functions when used as intended and under the conditions of misuse
    foreseeable by the manufacturer during normal operation and service.\n\nNOTE 1\tWhile
    this series of documents gives principles for the design, verification, validation
    and provision of information for use, the detailed requirements are dependent
    on the use case. Therefore, the design principles given in this document need
    to be extended and clarified by the use of relevant specific (type-C) standards,
    when available, or by the manufacturer of the machine using a risk assessment.
    Applicability of the design principles and any additional requirements, for design,
    verification, validation or information for use are outside the scope of this
    document.\n\nNOTE 2\tSafety requirements for specific non-automated functions
    of agricultural machinery and tractors can be available in machine-specific type-C
    standards.\n\nThis document is not applicable to:\n—\tforestry applications;\n—\toperations
    on public roads including relevant requirements for braking and steering systems.\nThis
    document is not applicable to agricultural machinery and tractors which are manufactured
    before the date of its publication."
