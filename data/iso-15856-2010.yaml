- content: |-
    ISO 15856:2009 is the first part of a series on space environment simulation for on-ground tests of materials used in space. This International Standard covers the testing of non-metallic materials exposed to simulated space radiation. Non-metallic materials include glasses, ceramics and polymer-metal composite materials such as metal matrix composites and laminated materials. ISO 15856:2009 does not cover semiconductor materials used for electronic components. The types of simulated radiation include charged particles (electrons and protons), solar ultraviolet radiation and soft X-radiation of solar flares. Synergistic interactions of the radiation environment are covered only for these natural, and some induced, environmental effects.
    ISO 15856:2009 outlines the recommended methodology and practices for the simulation of space radiation effects on materials. Simulation methods are used to reproduce the effects of the space radiation environment on materials that are located on surfaces of space vehicles and behind shielding.
