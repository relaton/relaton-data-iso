  content: ISO/IEC TR 11801-9904:2017(E) This technical report provides guidance on
    whether installed Class D and Class E channels specified in ISO/IEC 11801:2002
    will support 2,5GBASE-T and 5GBASE-T. It also provides mitigation procedures to
    improve the perfomance of Class D and Class E channels to the point where these
    applications are supported. Higher classes according to ISO/IEC 11801:2002 will
    support 2,5GBASE-T and 5GBASE-T without mitigation up to 100 m.
