- content: |-
    This document provides recommendations and requirements for the design, development, use and maintenance of biometric identification systems involving passive capture subjects, including pre- and post-deployment evaluation.
    While the emphasis is on surveillance systems, this document is also applicable to other types of biometric identification systems involving passive capture subjects, regardless of biometric characteristic or sensing technology. This includes systems involving passive capture of subjects where some capture subjects enrolled voluntarily.
    This document does not apply to biometric verification systems and biometric identification systems only involving capture subjects deliberately taking part in the capture.
    This document does not define specific services, platforms or tools.
