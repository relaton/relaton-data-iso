abstract:
- content: Specifies the general operating characteristics and standardization principles.
    Does not define a specific pattern for the connection system from the point of
    view of dimensions, but lays down limits for the design and performance for each
    system. This part lays down the basic requirements for the mechanical structure
    and electrical performances as well as the basic environmental conditions in service.
