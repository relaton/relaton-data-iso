    This document specifies general requirements and test methods for volumetric valves able to automatically deliver preset quantities of water. It is applicable to valves actuated by pipeline pressure and flow alone, and which do not need any other, external, source of energy.
    NOTE       Volumetric valves are typically required to operate correctly with different qualities of irrigation water at a variety of flow rates and at temperatures between 5 °C and 50 °C.
