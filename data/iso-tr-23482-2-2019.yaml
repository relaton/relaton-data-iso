abstract:
- content: This document provides guidance on the use of ISO 13482 and is intended
    to facilitate the design of personal care robots in conformity with ISO 13482.
    Additional guidance is provided for users with limited experience of risk assessment
    and risk reduction. This document provides clarification and guidance on new terms
    and safety requirements introduced to allow close human-robot interaction and
    human-robot contact in personal care robot applications, including mobile servant
    robots, physical assistant robots and person carrier robots. This document considers
    the application of ISO 13482 to all service robots and includes related examples.
