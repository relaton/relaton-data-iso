    ISO 4040:2009 specifies the location of controls in motor vehicles by subdividing the space within reach of drivers into specific zones, to which certain controls essential to the safe operation of vehicles are assigned. It also specifies certain combinations of functions for multifunction controls and the degree to which certain indicators and tell-tales are to be visible.
    ISO 4040:2009 is applicable to hand-operated controls, to indicators and to tell-tales in all motor vehicles, excluding motorcycles and mopeds, as defined in ISO 3833.
