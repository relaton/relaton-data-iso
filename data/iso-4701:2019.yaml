    This document specifies the methods to be employed for determination of size distributions by sieving of iron ore and direct reduced iron (excluding briquetted iron), utilizing sieves having aperture sizes of 36 µm or larger. The size distribution is expressed in terms of mass and percentage mass, passed or retained on selected sieves. The purpose of this document is to provide a basis for any testing of iron ore and direct reduced iron involving size determination for use by contracting parties in the sale and purchase of these materials.
    When this document is used for comparative purposes, the concerned parties will agree on the selection of the detailed method to be employed in order to eliminate sources of subsequent controversy.
