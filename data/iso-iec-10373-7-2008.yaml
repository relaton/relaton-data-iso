abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 10373 defines test methods for characteristics of identification
    cards according to the definition given in ISO/IEC 7810. Each test method is cross‑referenced
    to one or more base standards, which may be ISO/IEC 7810 or one or more of the
    supplementary standards that define the information storage technologies employed
    in identification card applications.\nISO/IEC 10373-7:2008 deals with test methods,
    which are specific to contactless integrated circuit card (vicinity card) technology.
    ISO/IEC 10373-1 deals with test methods which are common to one or more ICC technologies
    and other parts deal with other technology‑specific tests. \nUnless otherwise
    specified, the tests in ISO/IEC 10373-7:2008 apply exclusively to vicinity cards
    defined in ISO/IEC 15693‑1 and ISO/IEC 15693-2."
