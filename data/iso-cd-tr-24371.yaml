  content: "This document provides an overview of regulatory, business and best practice
    risk mitigation requirements that would apply to the implementation, operation
    and governance of NPI policies, procedures and mechanisms necessary to support
    the lifecycle of all NPIs.  It also lists the issues and challenges the working
    group has come across since working on AWI 24366-2, which have to be addressed
    before a new AWI 24366-N series could be started. \nThe purpose of this document
    is to provide the basis for the development of one or more international standards
    related to the safe creation, use and management of NPIs with maximum global interoperability.
