abstract:
- content: ISO 12405-3:2014 specifies test procedures and provides acceptable safety
    requirements for voltage class B lithium-ion battery packs and systems, to be
    used as traction batteries in electrically propelled road vehicles. Traction battery
    packs and systems used for two-wheel or three-wheel vehicles are not covered by
    ISO 12405-3:2014. ISO 12405-3:2014 is related to the testing of safety performance
    of battery packs and systems for their intended use in a vehicle. ISO 12405-3:2014
    is not intended to be applied for the evaluation of the safety of battery packs
    and systems during transport, storage, vehicle production, repair, and maintenance
    services.
