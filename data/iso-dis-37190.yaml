abstract:
- content: "This International Standard gives a framework for supervising each life
    cycle phase of smart community infrastructures as system of systems at practice
    and enables utilizing ISO 37155 series and ISO/TR 37152 in more comprehensive
    and practical manner especially for community and national authorities as well
    as relevant major contractors. ISO 37155 series are guidelines for development,
    operation and maintenance of smart community infrastructures to ensure that interactions
    of smart community infrastructures, such as ones between multiple infrastructures,
    between infrastructures and stakeholders, and between infrastructures and the
    external environment, are well identified and managed, and also consistent. ISO/TR
    37152 outlines the basic concept of a common framework for the development and
    operation of smart community infrastructures.\n\nTo give practical perspectives
    to this standard, collaboration with other ISO/TC 268 entities, such as ISO/TC
    268/SC1/TG2 “Smart Community Infrastructures - Pilot Testing” will be conducted.
    Two aspects of practical application will be taken into consideration for this
    guideline. The first is for a green field site, where all the smart community
    infrastructures can be designed and developed from scratch at the same time. This
    is of value to planners and investors of major new infrastructure developments.
    The second will be built up on the first use case and will support efficient management
    of an existing urban area by considering the increasing interdependencies of the
    infrastructures on each other and the way they should be managed as system of
    systems. \n\nThis standard can also reflect feedbacks given to the existing documents
    and accelerating changes in technologies and the environment."
