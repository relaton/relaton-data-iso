abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: ISO/IEC 24761:2009 specifies the structure and the data elements of Authentication
    Context for Biometrics (ACBio), which is used for checking the validity of the
    result of a biometric verification process executed at a remote site. ISO/IEC
    24761:2009 allows any ACBio instance to accompany any data item that is involved
    in any biometric process related to verification and enrolment. The specification
    of ACBio is applicable not only to single modal biometric verification but also
    to multimodal fusion. ISO/IEC 24761:2009 specifies the cryptographic syntax of
    an ACBio instance. The cryptographic syntax of an ACBio instance is based on an
    abstract Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) schema whose concrete values can be
    represented using either a compact binary encoding or a human-readable XML encoding.
    ISO/IEC 24761:2009 does not define protocols to be used between entities such
    as biometric processing units, claimant, and validator. Its concern is entirely
    with the content and encoding of the ACBio instances for the various processing
    activities.
