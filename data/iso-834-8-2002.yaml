    ISO 834-8:2002 specifies the procedures to be followed for determining the fire resistance of non-loadbearing vertical separating elements when exposed to heating on one face.
    This test is neither appropriate for the evaluation of curtain walls (non-loadbearing external walls suspended from the ends of floor slabs) nor for walls containing doors or glazing. For tests of walls containing doors refer to ISO 3008. For tests of walls containing glazing refer to ISO 3009.
    The application of this test to other untested forms of construction is acceptable when the construction complies with the direct field of application as given in ISO 834-8:2002 or when it is subjected to a field of extended application analysis in accordance with ISO/TR 12470.
