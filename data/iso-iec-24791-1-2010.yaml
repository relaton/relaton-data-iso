  content: "ISO/IEC 24791 defines a Software System Infrastructure that enables radio
    frequency identification (RFID) system operations between business applications
    and RFID interrogators. RFID software systems are composed of RFID interrogators,
    intermediate software systems, and applications that provide control and coordination
    of air interface operation, tag and sensor information exchange, and health and
    performance management of system components. \nISO/IEC 24791-1:2010 provides the
    following:\n- an overview of the Software System Infrastructure;\n- the relationship
    of the Software System Infrastructure to existing ISO components, e.g. ISO/IEC
    15962;\n- a basic description of each Software System Infrastructure component
    and the services that it provides (The detailed description of a particular component
    can be found in other parts of ISO/IEC 24791.);\n- illustrative (informative)
    deployment models of the components of the Software System Infrastructure."
