abstract:
- content: "ISO 22900-1:2008 provides the framework to allow diagnostic and reprogramming
    software applications from all vehicle manufacturers the flexibility to work with
    multiple vehicle communication interfaces (VCI) from multiple tool suppliers.
    This system enables each vehicle manufacturer to support all vehicle communication
    interfaces to perform diagnostics and to control the programming sequence for
    electronic control units (ECUs) in their vehicles.\nISO 22900-1:2008 describes
    the applicable use cases to justify the benefits of ISO 22900. It also specifies
    the design requirements to be followed by diagnostic and programming vehicle communication
    interface designers. The design requirements are categorized into different levels
    of conformance classes to provide:\n-        “software compliance”, a set of requirements
    for existing VCIs, which are software but not hardware compliant;\n-        “electrical
    compliance”, defining all signals and electrical interfaces that allow a system
    integrator to connect more than one VCI Protocol Module to the vehicle diagnostic
    connector and the host system;\n-        “mechanical compliance”, defining standard
    connectors on the VCI Protocol Module to interface to the vehicle Data Link Connector
    (DLC) and the host system, as well as defining a cabling concept to support interfacing
    more than one VCI Protocol Module.\nThe technical requirements specified in ISO
    22900-1:2008 have been influenced by the requirements of legal authority with
    regard to “vehicle OBD and programming”. \nThe Modular Vehicle Communication Interface
    hardware design requirements will provide appropriate development guidance for
    vehicle communication interface manufacturers to meet legal authority and automotive
    manufacturer demands with regard to inter-vendor operability."
