abstract:
- content: Applicable to products the content of which, expressed as sulphate, is
    equal or more than 5 mg/kg. The principle consists in the reduction of the sulphur
    compounds to hydrogen sulphide by heating with a mixture of hydriodic acid and
    hypophosphorous acid. Distillation of the hydrogen sulphide by a current of purified
    oxygen-free nitrogen in a mixture of sodium hydroxide and acetone. Titration of
    the sulphide with standard volumetric mercury(II) nitrate solution in the presence
    of dithizone as indicator.
