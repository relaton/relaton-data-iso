  content: The specified method is applicable when the required limit is not greater
    than 0,1 % and not less than 0,001 %. If the required limit lies outside that
    range, the mass of the test portion should be changed. The principle ot the test
    consists in comparison of the turbidity obtained by the addition of barium chloride
    solution to a solution of the sample, in the presence of hydrochloric acid, with
    that similarly produced from a sulphate solution of known concentration.
