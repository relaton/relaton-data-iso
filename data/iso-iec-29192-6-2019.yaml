abstract:
- content: |-
    This document specifies MAC algorithms suitable for applications requiring lightweight cryptographic mechanisms. These mechanisms can be used as data integrity mechanisms to verify that data has not been altered in an unauthorized manner. They can also be used as message authentication mechanisms to provide assurance that a message has been originated by an entity in possession of the secret key.
    The following MAC algorithms are specified in this document:
    a)    LightMAC;
    b)    Tsudik's keymode;
    c)    Chaskey-12.
