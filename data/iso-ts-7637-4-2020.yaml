abstract:
- content: This document specifies test methods and procedures to ensure the compatibility
    to conducted electrical transients along shielded high voltage supply lines of
    equipment installed on passenger cars and commercial vehicles fitted with electrical
    systems with voltages higher than 60 V d.c. and lower than 1 500 V d.c. and a
    power supply isolated from the vehicle body. It describes bench tests for both,
    injection and measurement of transients. It is applicable to all types of electrical
    independent driven, road vehicles (e.g. battery electrical vehicle (BEV) or hybrid
    electrical vehicle (HEV), plugin hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV)).
