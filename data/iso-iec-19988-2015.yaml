  content: "ISO/IEC 19988:2015 This GS1 Standard defines the Core Business Vocabulary
    (CBV).  The goal of this standard is to specify various vocabulary elements and
    their values for use in conjunction with the EPCIS standard [EPCIS1.1], which
    defines mechanisms to exchange information both within and across organization
    boundaries.  The vocabulary identifiers and definitions in this standard will
    ensure that all parties who exchange EPCIS data using the Core Business Vocabulary
    will have a common understanding of the semantic meaning of that data.\nISO/IEC
    19988:2015 is intended to provide a basic capability that meets the above goal.
    \ In particular, this standard is designed to define vocabularies that are core
    to the EPCIS abstract data model and are applicable to a broad set of business
    scenarios common to many industries that have a desire or requirement to share
    data.  This standard intends to provide a useful set of values and definitions
    that can be consistently understood by each party in the supply chain.\nAdditional
    end user requirements may be addressed by augmenting the vocabulary elements herein
    with additional vocabulary elements defined for a particular industry or a set
    of users or a single user. Additional values for the standard vocabulary types
    defined in this standard may be included in follow-on versions of this standard. "
