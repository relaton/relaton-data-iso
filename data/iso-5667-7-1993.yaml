abstract:
- content: Recommends procedures and equipment for sampling water and steam in boiler
    plants including examples of sampling apparatus, to provide samples for physical

    from which they are taken. The procedures for sampling apply to raw water, make-up
    water, boiler feed water, condensate, boiler water, cooling water. Does not apply
    to the sampling of water and steam in nuclear power plants.
