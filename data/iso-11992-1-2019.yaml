    This document describes the data link layer (DLL) and physical layer (PHY) for the two CAN-based network interfaces specified in the 11992-series.
    The DLL sub-clauses are composed of:
    —          DLL protocol entity requirements;
    —          DLL device interface requirements; and
    —          DLL network system requirements.
    Normally, the physical signalling sub-layer is implemented in the CAN protocol controller. The physical medium attachment sub-layer is normally implemented in the CAN transceiver or the System Base Chip (SBC). Optionally, it can comprise also additional protection circuitry. The media-dependent sub-layer comprises the connectors and the cabling.
    The physical signalling (PS) sub-clauses are composed of:
    —          PS entity requirements;
    —          PS device interface requirements; and
    —          PS network system requirements.
    The physical medium attachment (PMA) sub-clauses are composed of:
    —          PMA protocol entity requirements; and
    —          PMA device interface requirements.
    The physical medium dependent (PMD) sub-clauses are composed of:
    —          PMD entity requirements;
    —          PMD device interface requirements; and
    —          PMD network system requirements.
