abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 24800-3:2010, also known as “JPSearch Query Format (JPQF)”, provides
    a standardized interface for image search and retrieval systems in three aspects
    - input query format, output result format and query management - as a specialization
    of ISO/IEC 15938-12:2008 for images and accompanying metadata.\nThe top-level
    tools defined in ISO/IEC 24800-3:2010 are InputQuery, FetchResult, OutputResult
    and Management. Both InputQuery and FetchResult tools belong to input query format.
    \nThe input query format provides users/systems with a set of precise input parameters
    to describe their search criteria in addition to a set of preferred output parameters
    to depict the return result sets through InputQuery. Through InputQuery, users
    can use queries of various types, such as query by media, query by description,
    query by free text, and combine them using algebraic or logical expressions. Through
    FetchResult, users can retrieve search results of a query from the past. When
    a query request is issued using the asynchronous mode, the FetchResult element
    is used to indicate the preparedness of the user to receive results. When a query
    request is issued using the synchronous mode, the FetchResult element is used
    to receive individual pages of the result set (if paging is activated).\nThe OutputResult,
    which is the output result format, provides users/systems with a set of output
    parameters to describe the aggregated return result sets for user presentation
    or machine consumption. \nThe Management tool, which is the query management tool
    set, provides a means for selecting services (e.g. MPEG-7 database or Core Metadata
    services) or aggregated services (e.g. service provider that administers a set
    of different services) based on service properties (e.g. supported query format,
    supported metadata standard). \nThe goal is to define a query language that provides
    the industry with a standardized format to accept and respond to user/system specification
    for image searches. In the framework of JPSearch, the JPSearch Query Format is
    designed to be used as an interface between querying client and answering servers,
    as well as between aggregation service agent and individual service providers."
