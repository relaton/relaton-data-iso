    ISO 15590-1:2009 specifies the technical delivery conditions for bends made by the induction bending process for use in pipeline transportation systems for the petroleum and natural gas industries as defined in ISO 13623.
    ISO 15590-1:2009 is applicable to induction bends made from seamless and welded pipe of unalloyed or low-alloy steels. These are typically C-Mn steels or low-alloy steels that are appropriate for the corresponding level and grade of line pipe in accordance with ISO 3183.
    ISO 15590-1:2009 specifies the requirements for the manufacture of two product specification levels (PSL's) of induction bend corresponding to product specification levels given for pipe in ISO 3183.
    ISO 15590-1:2009 is not applicable to the selection of the induction bend product specification level. It is the responsibility of the purchaser to specify the PSL, based upon the intended use and design requirements; see also ISO 3183:2007, Introduction.
    ISO 15590-1:2009 is not applicable to pipeline bends made by other manufacturing processes.
