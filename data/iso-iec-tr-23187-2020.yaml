    —          definition of terms and concepts, and provision of an overview for interactions between CSNs and CSCs and CSPs;
    —          description of types of CSN interactions;
    —          description of interactions between CSNs and CSCs;
    —          description of interactions between CSNs and CSPs;
    —          description of elements of CSAs and Cloud SLAs for CSN interactions, both with CSPs and with CSCs.
