abstract:
- content: ISO/EC 14776-121:2010(E) specifies the performance requirements of the
    interconnect and expands the coverage to the complete assembled interconnect including
    connectors, uniform bulk cable, and non-uniform bulk cable. A syntax and framework
    is described for all types of passive interconnect. The methodology for performing
    the electrical measurements required to determine compliance with the performance
    requirements for bulk cable of several types, various assembled interconnects
    and printed circuit board designs is included. Details of the measurement methodology
    are specified to minimize the difference in measured results from different electrical
    testing laboratories. Details include calibration, fixturing and sample preparation,
    equipment, measurement procedure and data output format.
