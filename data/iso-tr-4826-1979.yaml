  content: The methods described are primarily in support to ISO 2919; to publish
    them as part of ISO 2919 was not yet possible because acceptance levels could
    not yet be specified. They are primarily applicable to prototype testing but may
    also be used for production and other tests. For the particle situation it is
    necessary to select from them the most suitable test or a combination of tests.
    The tests are made by radioactive means (wipe or immersion tests) or by non-radioactive
    means (bubble, helium pressurization or water pressurization tests).
