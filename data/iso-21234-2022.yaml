abstract:
- content: This document provides standard methods for determining a vehicle’s roll,
    pitch, and yaw mass moments of inertia (MOI) and roll-yaw product of inertia (POI).
    It applies to heavy vehicles, that is commercial vehicles and buses as defined
    in ISO 3833 (trucks and trailers with maximum weight above 3,5 tons and buses
    and articulated buses with maximum weight above 5 tons, according to ECE and EC
    vehicle classification, categories M3, N2, N3, O3 and O4). Mass moment of inertia
    measurements are performed separately for each single unit.
