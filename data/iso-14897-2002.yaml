abstract:
- content: ISO 14897 specifies methods used to measure the water content of polyols
    employed as polyurethane raw materials. Method A is a manual amperometric method
    which has been included to better define the principles of the Karl Fischer measurement.
    Amperometric methods are applicable to a wide range of polyols, including those
    which have enough colour to obscure a visual end-point. Method B includes an automated
    amperometric procedure and an automated coulometric procedure. The coulometric
    procedure is an absolute method that does not require calibration and gives improved
    sensitivity compared with amperometric methods.
