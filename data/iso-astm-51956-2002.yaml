- content: |-
    ISO/ASTM 51956 covers procedures for the use of thermoluminescence dosimeters (TLDs) utilized as routine dosimeters to determine the absorbed dose in a material irradiated by ionizing radiation. Examples of materials useful as TLDs include LiF, CaF 2, CaSO4, Li2B4O7 and Al2O3.
    Although some elements of the procedures have broader application, the specific area of concern is radiation processing of materials such as blood products, food and insects for sterile release programmes. This practice is applicable to the measurement of absorbed dose in materials irradiated by gamma rays, X rays and electrons. Source energies covered are from 0,1 MeV to 50 MeV for photons and electrons. The range of absorbed dose covered is approximately from 1 Gy to 105 Gy (10 2 rad to 107 rad), and the range of absorbed dose rates is approximately from 10-2 Gy s-1 to 1010 Gy s-1 (1 rad s-1 to 1012 rad s-1). Absorbed dose and absorbed dose-rate measurements in materials subjected to neutron irradiation are not covered in this practice.
    The values stated in SI units are to be regarded as the standard. The values given in parentheses are for information only.
