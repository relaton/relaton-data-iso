- content: |-
    ISO 10300-2:2014 specifies the basic formulae for use in the determination of the surface load capacity of straight and helical (skew), Zerol and spiral bevel gears including hypoid gears, and comprises all the influences on surface durability for which quantitative assessments can be made. ISO 10300-2:2014 is applicable to oil lubricated bevel gears, as long as sufficient lubricant is present in the mesh at all times.
    The formulae in ISO 10300-2:2014 are based on virtual cylindrical gears and restricted to bevel gears whose virtual cylindrical gears have transverse contact ratios of Ɛvα < 2. The results are valid within the range of the applied factors as specified in ISO 10300-1 (see ISO 6336-2). Additionally, the given relations are valid for bevel gears of which the sum of profile shift coefficients of pinion and wheel is zero (see ISO 23509).
