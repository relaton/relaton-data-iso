  content: This standard provides guidance for fire safety engineering that is applicable
    for fires in enclosed spaces. It is intended to be used in conjunction with models
    for analysis of the initiation and development of fire, fire spread, impact of
    heat, radiation, and limited visibility, smoke formation and movement, chemical
    species generation, transport and decay, and people movement, as well as fire
    detection and suppression.
