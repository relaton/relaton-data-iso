    This document specifies requirements for establishing the characteristic properties of structural laminated veneer lumber (LVL), including 5th percentile strength values, stiffness characteristics and other performance characteristics, related to its end use as a structural product for dry use (service class 1). It is applicable to members used in flatwise or edgewise bending orientations.
    It does not cover the assessment of formaldehyde requirements, biological durability, fire performance or manufacturing, such as quality control and marking.
