    ISO 10928:2016 specifies procedures suitable for the analysis of data which, when converted into logarithms of the values, have either a normal or a skewed distribution. It is intended for use with the test methods and referring standards for glass-reinforced thermosetting plastics (GRP) pipes or fittings for the analysis of properties as a function of time. However, it can be used for the analysis of other data.
    Depending upon the nature of the data, two methods are specified. The extrapolation using these techniques typically extends the trend from data gathered over a period of approximately 10 000 h to a prediction of the property at 50 years, which is the typical maximum extrapolation time.
    ISO 10928:2016 only addresses the analysis of data. The test procedures to collect the data, the number of samples required and the time period over which data are collected are covered by the referring standards and/or test methods. Clause 6 discusses how the data analysis methods are applied to product testing and design.
