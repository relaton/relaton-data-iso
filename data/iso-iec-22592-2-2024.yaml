    This document specifies test methods as well as test charts to measure the geometric property attributes and those variations in duplex colour prints typically used in office environment. This document is applicable to duplex prints comprising several sheets which are printed colour images on both surfaces of a substrate.
    “Within-page variation” and “sheet-to-sheet variation” are also applicable for a simplex print set comprising several sheets, which are printed colour images on one surface of a substrate and no image on the other surface.
    Prints with four primary colourants other than cyan, magenta, yellow and black are outside the scope of this document.
    Included are digital prints formed by using a multifunction or single function printer. When a duplex print set is evaluated, duplex printers which are capable to print images on both sides of substrate automatically are applicable, while simplex printers which require a manual arrangement of substrates between the front side and back side printing to form duplex prints are out of scope of this document. The printers of the maximum applicable substrate size of A4 or larger are suitable for the measurements.
    The geometric property attributes included are registration and magnification of a print set.
    Microscopic geometrical density variations, such as graininess, mottle and line raggedness, are outside the scope of this document.
    The sources of variations considered are locations in a page, print side in a sheet, print order of sheets in a print set, and variations among primary colours.
