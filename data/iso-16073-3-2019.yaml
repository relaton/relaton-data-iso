    This document specifies test methods and minimum performance requirements for personal protective clothing, designed to protect the wearer's body, except for the head, hands, and feet, that is worn during wildland firefighting and associated activities. This clothing is not intended to provide protection during fire entrapment. This document covers the general design of the garment, the minimum level of performance for the materials employed and the methods of test to determine these levels.
    This document is not applicable to clothing for use in situations encountered in structural firefighting (ISO 11999‑3), rescue (ISO 18639‑3) or where a high level of infrared radiation is expected (ISO 15538), nor does this document cover clothing to protect against chemical, biological, electrical or radiation hazards. This document does not provide protection against high mechanical risks such as for protection when using chain saws.
    NOTE       For information on test methods, minimum performance requirements and general design refer to ISO 15384.
