    This document provides a laboratory test method to determine the skin-friction of antifouling paints coated on drums.
    The results of the laboratory-tested friction of painted drums over a certain period of time can be used for screening of antifouling paints and characterizing changes in friction for different antifouling paints, amongst other applications and other purposes depending on the user's need.
    This document is applicable to both biocidal-based and biocide-free antifouling paints.
