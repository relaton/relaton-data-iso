abstract:
- content: "ISO/TR 22442-4:2010 offers suggestions for designing and conducting validation
    assays to help determine if processes used in the manufacture of medical devices
    derived from non-viable animal tissues might serve to reduce the risk of iatrogenic
    transmission of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs). \nThe TSE-removal
    methods used to process animal tissues should also reduce the risk of transmitting
    TSE infections via non-viable tissues of human origin; this Technical Report does
    not address this issue. Some current information on human tissues and TSEs is
    presented which may be applied by analogy to other animal tissues.\nISO/TR 22442-4:2010
    does not intend to imply a need for validation of methods involving specific materials
    identified as having a \"negligible risk\" of contamination with TSE agents as
    listed in Annex C of ISO 22442-1:2007.\nIt is intended to clarify final draft
    international standards included in the ISO 22442 series, as well as in ISO 14160.\nISO/TR
    22442-4:2010 builds upon the specific discussion in ISO 22442-3 relative to TSE
    agents and attempts to summarize the current state of the art in the arena of
    TSE agent elimination. As the understanding of inactivation and elimination of
    TSE agents evolves, this document will be revised when possible."
