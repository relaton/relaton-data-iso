  content: This document presents a list of common practices in preparation methods
    of metallographic specimens for optical and scanning electron microscopy, including
    preliminary preparation, grinding and polishing of specimens as well as microstructure
    revelation methods covering the optical method, etching methods (chemical, electrolytic,
    constant potential, ion sputtering and high temperature relieving) and the interface
    layer method [1][2].
