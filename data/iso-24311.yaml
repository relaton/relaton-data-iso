  content: "This document provides information and specifications enabling management
    of road traffic in controlled zones applying geofencing. Specifically, this document
    provides \n—\ta “Controlled Zone Data Dictionary” (CZDD) for management of controlled
    zones providing an extendible toolkit that regulators can use e.g. to inform potential
    CZ users, e.g. vehicles, about \n—\tthe CZ area, i.e. the geographical boundaries
    of the CZ;\n—\tCZ access conditions including exempts; \n—\ttime windows indicating
    when these CZ access conditions are applicable, allowing the potential CZ users
    to select an appropriate routing, either by pre-trip planning or ad hoc re-routing,\n—\tand
    illustrations and guidelines on how to use this toolkit.\nThe toolkit is designed
    in compliance with the general ITS station and communications architecture specified
    in ISO 21217 [8], and optionally applicable C-ITS protocols and procedures, e.g.
    ISO 22418:2018 [10] on “Service Announcement”, EN ISO 18750 on the “Local Dynamic
    Map”, and EN ISO 17419 [5] on globally unique identifiers.\nEnforcement is out
    of scope of this document."
