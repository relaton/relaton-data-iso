    ISO 22006:2009 gives guidelines to assist crop producers in the adoption of ISO 9001:2008 for crop production processes. The term "crop" includes seasonal crops (such as grains, pulses, oilseeds, spices, fruit and vegetables), row-planted crops that are cultivated, perennial crops that are managed over a period of time, and wild crops that are not formally planted or managed. Horticultural crops provide an even broader range of types from annual and perennial fruits, vegetables, and ornamental flowering plants to perennial shrubs and trees, and root crops. These diverse crops require a broad range of planting, cultivating, pest control, and harvesting methods and practices. Decisions regarding planting, growing, and harvesting activities can be similar, although specific steps can be quite different when considering the range of crops.
    ISO 22006:2009 gives guidelines on the use and application of ISO 9001:2008 to the establishment and management of a quality management system (QMS) by an organization involved in crop production.
    ISO 22006:2009 is not intended to change, add or reduce the requirements of ISO 9001:2008, nor is it intended for certification.
    Further down the supply chain, in manufacturing processes, the language of ISO 9001:2008, ISO 15161 or ISO 22000 is considered more appropriate. The need for an ISO 9001:2008-based system containing agricultural terminology became apparent due to difficulties in the interpretation of the language of ISO 9001:2008 for crop production applications.
