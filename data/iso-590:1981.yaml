  content: The oil shall be a clear mobile liquid which may become cloudy or crystalline
    at low temperatures. The colour shall be yellow to brownish-yellow, the odour
    characteristic, recalling safrole. The relative density at 20/20 °C has to ly
    between 1,082 and 1,094 and the refractive index at 20 °C between 1,5330 and 1,5370.
    The optical rotation shall range from - 0,50 to + 3,0 . The miscibility with 90
    % (V/V) ethanol at 20 °C shall be 1 volume in 2 volumes to give a clear solution.
    The freezing point shall ly between 7,5 °C and 9,5 °C. Sampling and testing of
    the characteristics specified have to be carried out according to the corresponding
    ISO-Standards.
