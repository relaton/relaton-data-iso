    This document establishes guiding principles and best practices at the programmatic level for all participants in the rendezvous and proximity operations (RPO) and on-orbit servicing (OOS) industry. These principles and practices establish the broadest boundaries for behaviour of participants in the RPO/OOS industry and precede more detailed standards. In principle, the document also covers both robotic and HSF missions, but requirements are derived from robotic missions.
    This document is applicable to a broad array of RPO/OOS industry participants from spacecraft equipment manufacturers, spacecraft operators, service providers, developers of RPO/OOS simulation, planning and safety tools, and insurers. It helps to establish responsible norms of behaviour for RPO and OOS that industry participants are supposed to achieve and to promote throughout the global industry.
