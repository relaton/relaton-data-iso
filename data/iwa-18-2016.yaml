    IWA 18:2016 provides guidelines for addressing challenges faced by societies that have been unable to adapt to an ageing population. It can also be used by stakeholders as a useful reference at regional or global level.
    IWA 18:2016 addresses health, care and social challenges (including health care needs, daily living tasks, well-being, combating isolation and keeping safe) to ensure that the needs of individuals continue to be met as they grow older. It also outlines principles related to ethics, community-based solutions, integration, person-centred solutions and innovation.
