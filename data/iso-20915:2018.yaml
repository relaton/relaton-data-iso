- content: |-
    This document specifies guidelines and requirements for conducting life cycle inventory (LCI) studies of steel products reflecting steel's capacity for closed-loop recycling, including:
    a)    specification of the functional unit used for LCI calculation of steel products;
    b)    definition of the system boundaries used for LCI calculation of steel products;
    c)    evaluation of scrap in LCI calculation of steel products;
    d)    evaluation of co-products in LCI calculation of steel products;
    e)    reporting of LCI calculation results of steel products.
    The application of LCI results, including life cycle impact assessment (LCIA), is outside the scope of this document.
