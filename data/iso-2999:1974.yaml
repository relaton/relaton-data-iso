  script: Latn
  content: Applicable to products containing at least 90 % (m/m) of tetrasodium pyrophosphate
    and in the absence of more condensed forms of phosphates. The reaction based on
    conversion of tetrasodium pyrophosphate to disodium dihydrogenpyrophosphate by
    addition of hydrochloric acid. Introduction of zinc sulfate in solution for precipitation
    of zinc pyrophosphate and formation of sulphuric acid. Potentiometric titration
    of the sulphuric acid formed with standard volumetric sodium hydroxide solution.
    Has also been approved by the IUPAC.
