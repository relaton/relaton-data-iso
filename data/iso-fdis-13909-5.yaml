  content: |-
    ISO 13909-5:2016 specifies procedures and requirements for the design and establishment of sampling schemes for the mechanical sampling of coke from moving streams and the methods of sampling used.
    The diversity of types of equipment for sampling and the conditions under which mechanical sampling is performed make it inappropriate to specify standard designs for samplers which will be applicable to all situations.
