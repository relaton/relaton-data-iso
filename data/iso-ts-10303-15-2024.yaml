    This document specifies the transformation of SysML (ISO/IEC 19514) constructs to XSD constructs and Schematron (ISO/IEC 19757) constructs for the purpose of representing the SysML model represented in XMI (ISO/IEC 19509) as XML[13] schemas and Schematron rules.
    The specified mapping is a one-way transformation from SysML information model represented in XMI into an XML schema and Schematron rules. These limitations make the mapping unsuitable for the transformation of arbitrary SysML models.
    The following are within the scope of this document:
    —     the specification of the structure, components, and conventions of the XSD for the ISO 10303 series XML implementation method;
    —     the transformation of SysML metamodel constructs represented in XMI to XSD constructs for the purpose of representing SysML information models as XML schemas;
    —     the transformation of SysML constructs to Schematron constructs for the purpose of representing the SysML model constraints represented in XMI as Schematron rules.
    The following are outside the scope of this document:
    —     the transformation of SysML metamodel constructs into XSD constructs that are not used in the STEP Extended Architecture;
    —     the transformation of SysML metamodel constructs into XSD constructs for other purposes than representing SysML constructs as STEP concepts;
    —     codes and scripts to transform SysML XMI to XSD schema and to Schematron rules;
    —     process, codes, and scripts to apply Schematron rules on XML documents with a resulting human-readable report.
