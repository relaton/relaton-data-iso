  content: Specifies measurement methods and maximum ratings for indoor background
    sound pressure levels. Applies to noise emitted by heating, ventilating and air-conditioning
    systems, intrusive noise from the projector(s) and noise emitted by any other
    mechanical or electrical equipment, but not to intrusive noise from outside, such
    as traffic noise. It is intended for application when the background noise is
    essentially a steady-state sound, without strong time-varying components.
