abstract:
- content: "This document defines quality measures useful for requirements and evaluation
    of IT service quality in terms of characteristics and sub-characteristics defined
    in ISO/IEC TS 25011.\nThis document contains a basic set of quality measures for
    each characteristic and sub-characteristic.\nThis document does not assign ranges
    of values of the quality measures to rated levels or to grades of compliance.
    Such values are defined based on the nature of the IT service, and so depends
    on factors such as category of the IT service or users' needs. Some attributes
    can have a desirable range of values, which does not depend on specific user needs
    but generic factors, for example, service downtime. This document includes, in
    Annex A, considerations for the selection and application of quality measures.\nThe
    quality measures in this document are primarily intended to be used for quality
    evaluation and improvement of IT services during or after the development life
    cycle.\nThe main users of this document are people carrying out quality requirements
    specification and evaluation activities for IT services as part of the following:\n—
    \    development: including requirements analysis, design, implementation, testing
    and deployment during the development life cycle;\n—     quality management: monitoring
    activities of quality assurance and performing quality control of an IT service;\n—
    \    supply: making a contract with the user for supplying an IT service under
    the terms of a contract;\n—     acquisition: including IT service selection, when
    acquiring or procuring an IT service from a service provider;\n—     maintenance:
    improvement of an IT service based on quality measurement.\nThe relationship of
    this document to domain-specific IT service quality model and its precedence over
    this document is determined by the user in a specific context of use.\n "
