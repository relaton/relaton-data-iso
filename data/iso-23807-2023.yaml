- content: |-
    This document describes the requirements involved in ship to shore data communication between the shipboard data servers and the on-shore data servers. It provides information on:
    —    asynchronous communication;
    —    a method to measure end-to-end communication quality;
    —    transport integrity;
    —    transport security (e.g. encryption, authentication and authorization);
    —    management of data transmission (e.g. prioritization, logging, carrier awareness/management);
    —    communication optimization (e.g. deduplication, compression, resume, multiplexing);
    —    compliance with the data communication protocols, including but not limited to ISO 19847.
    This document does not cover:
    —    the security of the data producer/consumer (e.g. identity management);
    —    communication equipment requirements;
    —    carrier performance requirements (e.g. bandwidth and latency).
