    This document covers requirements and tests for the electric and electronic components in road vehicles equipped with an electrical system operating at a nominal voltage of 48 V DC.
    This includes the following:
    —     general requirements on 48 V DC electrical systems;
    —     voltage ranges;
    —     slow voltage transients and fluctuations (not including EMC).
