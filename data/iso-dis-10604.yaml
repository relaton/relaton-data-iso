abstract:
- content: Specifies the dimensional, mechanical and optical quality criteria for
    equipment to measure or to verify the orientation of the luminous beams emitted
    by the headlamps installed on road motor vehicles excluding mopeds and motorcycles.
    The equipment also allows evaluation of the quality of the luminous beams by visual
    means. Lays down the requirements for the floor on which the vehicles are placed,
    the vehicle preparation, equipment using a distant screen, optical equipment with
    installation and operating instructions, photometric devices.
