    ISO 17546:2016 specifies design and minimum verification requirements for lithium ion rechargeable (including lithium ion polymer) batteries for space vehicles.
    Lithium ion secondary electrochemical systems use intercalation compounds (intercalated lithium exists in an ionic or quasi-atomic form within the lattice of the electrode material) in the positive and in the negative electrodes.
    The focus of this International Standard is on "battery assembly" and cell is described as "component cells" to be harmonized with other industrial standards and regulations.
    "Performance"," safety", and "logistics" are the main points of view to specify.
    ISO 17546:2016 does not address "disposal" or "recycle"; however, some recommendations regarding disposal are suggested.
