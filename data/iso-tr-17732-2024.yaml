    This document describes a basic role model of communications as a common platform for ITS services including cooperative service in smart city areas:
    a)       a framework for the provision of a communication service;
    b)       a description of the concept of operations and the role models;
    c)        a conceptual architecture between actors involved in the provision/receipt of communication;
    d)       references for the key documents on which the architecture is based;
    e)       a taxonomy of the organization of generic procedures, with a focus on the basic role and functional model of service for the introduction of communications including infrastructure facilities to support mobility in urban and rural areas.
    In-vehicle control system is not within the scope of this document.
    The scope of this document is limited to the communications using physical and digital infrastructure.
