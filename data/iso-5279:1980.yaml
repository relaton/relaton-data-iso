abstract:
- content: Applicable to the quantitative determination of contents of benzene, C8
    aromatics and aliphatics up to n-nonane in the range between 0.01 % (m/m) and
    1.00 % (m/m). Alternatives that will give equivalent results may also be used.
    Addition of a known amount of intgernal standard to a test portion and introduction
    of an aliquot portion of this mixture into a separating column. Sweeping of the
    vaporized mixture through the column by a flow of carrier gas. Detection of each
    component as it emerges by a flame ionization detector and recording as a peak
    on a diagram. Identification by their relative retention times and quantitative
    determination from the ratio of their peak areas.
