    ISO 20579-4:2018 identifies information to be reported in a datasheet, certificate of analysis, report or other publication regarding the handling of nano-objects in preparation for surface chemical analysis. This information is needed to ensure reliability and reproducibility of analyses needed to advance research and technology using these materials, and for obtaining appropriate understanding of potential nano-object environmental and biological impacts. Such information is in addition to other details associated with specimen synthesis, processing history and characterization, and should become part of the data record (sometimes identified as provenance information) regarding the source of the material and changes that have taken place since it was originated.
    ISO 20579-4:2018 includes informative annexes that summarize challenges associated with nano-objects that highlight the need for increased documentation and reporting in a material data record (Annex A) and provide examples of methods commonly used to extract particles from a solution for surface chemical analysis (Annex B). An example set of relevant sample data is shown in Annex C.
    ISO 20579-4:2018 does not define the nature of instrumentation or operating procedures needed to ensure that the analytical measurements described have been appropriately conducted.
