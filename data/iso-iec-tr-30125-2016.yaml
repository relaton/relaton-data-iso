    ISO/IEC TR 30125:2016 provides guidance for developing a consistent and secure method of biometric (either alone or supported by non-biometric) personalization and authentication in a mobile environment for systems procured on the open market.
    Guidance is provided for
    -      1:1 verification or 1:few positive identification;
    -      biometric sample capture in the mobile environment where conditions are not well controlled and not covered in ISO/IEC Biometric interchange format standards and the ISO/IEC Biometric sample quality Technical Reports;
    NOTE 1    Further information regarding architectures may be found in NIST/SP 500-288.
    -      the best use of multiple biometric and non-biometric (PINs, passwords, personal data) personalization and authentication methods (i.e. multifactor).
    NOTE 2    More information may be found in ISO/IEC 30108‑1.
    ISO/IEC TR 30125:2016 defines a framework to address methods and approaches for remote and unsupervised enrolment, together with secure storage and transmission of biometric and supporting biographic data, covering a variety of both online connected and offline modes.
    ISO/IEC TR 30125:2016 identifies the functional elements and components of a generic mobile biometric system and the distinct characteristics of each component. It provides guidance related to a generic mobile architecture with reference to supporting standards.
    The context recognizes a) the user as being mobile and b) operation across a variety of platforms, particularly mobile devices but also including tablet, laptop and other personal computing devices. The key to defining this context is whether the user's environment is physically controlled by the organization to which the user seeks access.
