    ISO 27025:2010 defines the quality assurance (QA) requirements for the establishment and implementation of QA programmes for projects covering mission definition, design, development, production and operations of space systems, including disposal.
    It is applicable to the customer-supplier relationship for space products to the extent agreed by both parties. The requirements of this International Standard and its associated referenced standards are tailored to the needs and classes of specific projects.
    When viewed from the perspective of a specific project context, the requirements defined in ISO 27025:2010 are tailored to match the genuine requirements of a particular profile and circumstances of a project.
