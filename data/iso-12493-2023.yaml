    This document describes two methods for measuring stress in tension under non-isothermal conditions.
    —    Method A: The thermal stress is measured for various pre-strain and temperature conditions as a function of time.
    —    Method B: The change of stress is measured in a test piece at a given strain and under variation of temperature at a given heating rate as a function of temperature. In this way, the determination of the thermal-mechanical behaviour of a rubber can be accelerated, e.g. for the purpose of comparative testing of aging or estimating the upper limit of the operating temperature.
    The measurement device, which is equipped with a suitable heating chamber, is used to record the stress as a function of time or temperature until the sample breaks or the stress has approached zero or for a certain time.
