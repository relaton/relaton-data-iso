    ISO 13073-1.2012 specifies a risk assessment method that protects the marine environment from the potential negative impacts of biocidally active substances that are intentionally used in the anti-fouling system applied to a ship during its service life. This method can also be modified for use in freshwater environments.
    ISO 13073-1.2012 does not provide a specific test method for evaluating the hazard and toxicity or usage restrictions of certain substances. This also does not provide an efficacy-evaluation method for an anti-fouling system using a specific substance.
    The following are not covered by ISO 13073-1.2012: the risk assessment of biocidally active substances in anti-fouling systems during their application and removal during vessel maintenance and repair, new building or ship recycling; the use of anti-fouling systems intended to control harmful aquatic organisms and pathogens in ships' ballast water and sediments according to the International Convention for The Control and Management of Ships' Ballast Water and Sediments, 2004; anti-fouling systems applied to fishing gear, buoys and floats used for the purpose of fishing, and to equipment used in fisheries and aquaculture (nets/cages etc); test patches of anti-fouling systems on ships for the purpose of research and development of anti-fouling products; and the assessment of risk of biocidally active substances in cases of accidental releases, such as spillage during ocean transport or releases into the sea from rivers and/or coastal facilities.
