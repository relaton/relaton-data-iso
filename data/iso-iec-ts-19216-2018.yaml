abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC TS 19216:2018 describes extensions to the C++ Standard Library.
    This document specifies requirements for implementations of an interface that
    computer programs written in the C++ programming language may use to perform operations
    related to networking, such as operations involving sockets, timers, bu˙er management,
    host name resolution and internet protocols. This document is applicable to information
    technology systems that can perform network operations, such as those with operating
    systems that conform to the POSIX interface. This document is applicable only
    to vendors who wish to provide the interface it describes.
