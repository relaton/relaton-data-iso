- content: |-
    This document sets out guidelines for checking conformity with quantifiable characteristics using the test or measurement result and its associated measurement uncertainty.
    This document is applicable whenever the uncertainty may be quantified according to the principles laid down in ISO/IEC Guide‑98‑3 (GUM). The term uncertainty is thus a descriptor for all elements of variation in the measurement result, including uncertainty due to sampling.
    This document does not give rules for how to act when an inconclusive result of a conformity test has been obtained.
    NOTE      There are not limitations on the nature of the entity subject to the requirements nor on the quantifiable characteristic. Examples of entities together with quantifiable characteristics are given in Table A.1.
