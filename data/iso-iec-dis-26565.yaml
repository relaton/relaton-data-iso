abstract:
- content: "This document, within the context of methods and tools that support adoption,
    construction, operation, and \nmanagement of product line maturity framework,\n—
    specifies processes for managing, operationalizing, and supporting product line
    maturity framework (those processes are described in terms of purpose, inputs,
    tasks, and outcomes),\n— specifies method capabilities to support the defined
    tasks of each process, and\n— specifies tool capabilities that automate or semi-automate
    tasks and methods.\n\nThis document does not concern the processes and capabilities
    of methods and tools for a single system \nbut rather deals with those for a family
    of products."
