abstract:
- content: "ISO 26022:2010 describes a dynamic dual-task method that quantitatively
    measures human performance degradation on a primary driving-like task while a
    secondary task is being performed. The result is an estimate of secondary task
    demand.\nThe method is laboratory based, and ISO 26022:2010 defines the method,
    the minimum requirements for equipment to support the method, and procedures for
    collecting and analyzing data derived from the method. \nThe method is applicable
    to all types of interactions with in-vehicle information, communication, entertainment
    and control systems; manual, visual, haptic and auditory, and combinations thereof.
    Secondary tasks requiring speed variations to be performed cannot be tested with
    this method. It applies to both Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) and aftermarket
    in-vehicle systems. It also applies to systems either portable or integrated into
    the vehicle. The driver behaviour principles, the specific task procedures and
    driving task correspond only to the operation of a passenger car."
