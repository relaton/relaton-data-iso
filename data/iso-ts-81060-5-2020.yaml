  content: "This document specifies requirements for the repeatability and reproducibility
    of non-invasive blood pressure (NIBP) simulators intended to test automated sphygmomanometers
    utilizing the oscillometric non-continuous method only. \nIn addition, the pulse
    rate set on the NIBP simulator is tested.\nThis document is not intended to relate
    the signals, generated by the NIBP simulator, to the oscillometric signal recorded
    in a cuff attached to a human. It does not intend to test the interaction between
    the NIBP simulator and the tested automated sphygmomanometer (e.g. the agreement
    of the set values of the NIBP simulator and the displayed values of the tested
    automated sphygmomanometer or the properties of the cuff and tubing, such as design
    or elastic properties). \nNOTE 1  These parameters can be tested separately in
    a clinical investigation or by using different special test setups. \nThis document
    does not check whether or not the NIBP simulator is able to test the accuracy
    of the absolute blood pressure value of oscillometric automated sphygmomanometers.\nNOTE
    2  Usually this is tested by a clinical investigation according ISO 81060-2 or
    other protocols.\nThis document is applicable to NIBP simulators testing automated
    sphygmomanometers for adults, children and neonates at the upper arm, thigh etc.
    and automated sphygmomanometers measuring at the wrist."
