    This document specifies proposals for the tolerances and methods for measuring the base and add power of refractive/symmetric multifocal contact lenses. This document is not intended to measure current production lenses (or similar) and does not include measurement of diffractive multifocal contact lenses nor the measurement of distance (or label) power.
    This document is intended to obtain additional feedback from clinicians, manufacturers, and health authorities on the proposals for tolerances and test methods. This document is not intended to be used in any quality system or by any governing body to control the manufacturing or acceptance of contact lenses.
