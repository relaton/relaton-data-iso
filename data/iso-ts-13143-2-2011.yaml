    ISO/TS 13143-2:2011 specifies the abstract test suite (ATS) to evaluate the conformity of on-board equipment (OBE) and roadside equipment (RSE) to ISO/TS 12813.
    It provides a basis for conformance tests for dedicated short range communication (DSRC) equipment (on-board units and roadside equipment) to enable interoperability between equipment supplied by different manufacturers.
    In order to ascertain that OBE and RSE fulfil essential radio requirements, they are also likely to be subject to additional factory, site and system acceptance testing (e.g. of physical and environmental endurance, quality assurance and control at manufacturing, and charge point integration), which is outside the scope of ISO/TS 13143-2:2011.
