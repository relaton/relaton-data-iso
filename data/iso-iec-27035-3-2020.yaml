abstract:
- content: |-
    This document gives guidelines for information security incident response in ICT security operations. This document does this by firstly covering the operational aspects in ICT security operations from a people, processes and technology perspective. It then further focuses on information security incident response in ICT security operations including information security incident detection, reporting, triage, analysis, response, containment, eradication, recovery and conclusion.
    This document is not concerned with non-ICT incident response operations such as loss of paper-based documents.
    This document is based on the "Detection and reporting" phase, the "Assessment and decision" phase and the "Responses" phase of the "Information security incident management phases" model presented in ISO/IEC 27035‑1:2016.
    The principles given in this document are generic and intended to be applicable to all organizations, regardless of type, size or nature. Organizations can adjust the provisions given in this document according to their type, size and nature of business in relation to the information security risk situation.
    This document is also applicable to external organizations providing information security incident management services.
