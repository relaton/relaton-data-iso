  content: "1 Scope \nThis part of ISO 9241 specifies evaluation methods for the design
    of physical input devices for interactive systems. It provides guidance for the
    laboratory assessment of conformance with ISO 9241-410 for keyboards, mice, pucks,
    joysticks, trackballs, touch pads, tablets/overlays, touch-sensitive screens,
    and styli/light pens. Its provisions apply only to keyboards identified as \"full-size\"
    or \"compact\" by the manufacturer, but nevertheless could provide useful guidance
    in the design of other keyboards. It is not applicable to those of the requirements
    of ISO 9241-410 that relate to gesture- and voice-input systems.  "
