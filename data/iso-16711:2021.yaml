abstract:
- content: |-
    This document provides requirements for seismic assessment and retrofit of concrete structures.
    It can be used to reduce the risk of seismic damage by structural collapse or turnover during a seismic event.
    This document provides the framework and principles of methods of detailed seismic assessment and the judgment, seismic retrofit plan and design, seismic retrofit execution of existing reinforced concrete structures before the occurrence of a severe earthquake and of the structures struck by an earthquake.
    It is an umbrella-type document with general provisions intended to provide wide latitude of choice in terms of comprehensive principle on the evaluation of the seismic damage/expected damage of existing reinforced concrete structures and repair/retrofit. Therefore, it is intended to be used in conjunction with sound engineering judgment.
    This document is applicable to reinforced concrete structures and pre-stressed concrete structures that have been designed on the basis of the structural design criteria set in a specific country or region.
    It is not applicable to unreinforced concrete and masonry structures.
