abstract:
- content: ISO/TR 17400:2003 is applicable to new projects and programs and to redesigned
    and upgraded launch pad and integration sites. ISO/TR 17400:2003 establishes the
    testing phases, goals, and general aspects for launch space complexes and complexes
    for assembly and tests of a vehicle and spacecraft and the associated equipment
    that, after successful testing, will be ready for launch vehicle processing and
    launch. ISO/TR 17400:2003 may be applicable to the creation of international launch
    pad and integration sites. At creation of new launching space complexes and complexes
    for assembly and tests of a vehicle and spacecraft (or at their modernization)
    within the framework of one country, the rules established by that country may
    be applied.
