    The CDIF family of standards is primarily designed to be used as a description of a mechanism for transferring
    information between modelling tools. It facilitates a successful transfer when the authors of the importing and
    exporting tools have nothing in common except an agreement to conform to CDIF.
    The CDIF family of standards includes a semantic metamodel and a transfer format definition. It also includes the
    specification of a meta-metamodel and associated rules that define a framework for the semantic metamodel and
    the transfer format. The language that is defined for the transfer format also has applicability as a general language
    for Import/Export for repositories. The CDIF semantic metamodel also has applicability as the basis of standard
    definitions for use in repositories.
    The standards that form the complete family of CDIF Standards are documented in ISO/IEC 15474-1:2002,
    Information technology - CDIF framework - Part 1: Overview. These standards cover the overall framework, the
    transfer format and the CDIF semantic metamodel.
    Figure 1 − CDIF family of standards
    The diagram in Figure 1 depicts the various standards that comprise the CDIF family of standards. The shaded box
    depicts this Standard and its position in the CDIF family of standards.
    This document (ISO/IEC 15474-2:2002, Information technology - CDIF framework - Part 2: Modelling and
    extensibility) includes the definition of the CDIF meta-metamodel and describes the rules and notations used
    throughout the CDIF family of standards. The rules for extending the CDIF semantic metamodel are also defined.
    This document is intended to be used by anyone wishing to understand and/or use CDIF. This document provides
    an introduction to the entire CDIF family of standards. It is suitable for:
     Those evaluating CDIF,
     Those who wish to understand the principles and concepts of a CDIF transfer, and
     Those developing importers and exporters.
    The document, ISO/IEC 15474-1:2002, Information technology - CDIF framework - Part 1: Overview, and this
    framework document ISO/IEC 15474-2:2002, Information technology - CDIF framework - Part 2: Modelling and
    extensibility, should be read first when initially exploring CDIF and before attempting to read other documents in the
    CDIF family of standards.
    While there are no specific prerequisites for reading this document, it will be helpful for the reader to have familiarity
    with the following:
     Entity-Relationship-Attribute modelling;
     Modelling (CASE) tools;
     Information repositories;
     Data dictionaries;
     Multiple meta-layer modelling.
