abstract:
- content: "This document series describes a generic system for the exchange of data
    between truck chassis manufacturers and bodywork manufacturers. It applies to
    commercial vehicles as defined in ISO 3833, having a maximum gross vehicle mass
    above 3 500 kg.\nThe process of exchanging product data can involve:\n— chassis
    manufacturer;\n— chassis importer;\n— chassis dealer;\n— one or more bodywork
    manufacturers; and\n— bodywork component suppliers, e.g. manufacturers of demountable
    bodies, cranes and loading \nequipment, tipping equipment.\nThis document describes
    the general principles and provides an overview and recommendations to assist
    the parties implementing BEP codes for their communication process. The recommendations
    cover different ways to communicate and present the BEP codes. In particular,
    the application of XML for communication of BEP codes in an unambiguous way is
    described."
