    The primary objectives of this guideline are to present a standard method for avoiding galvanic corrosion in the design stage, to present a standard method for determining whether actual corrosion damage was caused by galvanic corrosion, and to present a guideline for standard methods for suppressing galvanic corrosion that occurs in the presence of an electrolyte when two or more different types of electrically conductive materials, mainly metals, are in contact.
    This guideline includes a method for analysis and prediction of galvanic corrosion in environments, mainly water, by numerical calculation based on polarization data.
