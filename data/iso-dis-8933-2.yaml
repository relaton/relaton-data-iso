  content: "This standard describes generic measuring and calculation methods to evaluate
    the energy efficiency of multiple components connected in a system called a functional
    unit.\nThe system is further characterized by integrating multiple functions to
    achieve an overall goal.\nThe purpose of this standard is to allow for the comparison
    of the energy efficiency of various functional units, thus ensuring that efficient
    design is rewarded.\nThe standard is limited to functional units for which a “unit
    output” can be clearly defined and which require energy to function. \nThe standard
    only covers energy consuming functional units.\n\nThis standard deals with five
    types of functional units:\na.\tPressure functional units \nb.\tFlow functional
    units\nc.\tLighting functional units\nd.           Heating/Cooling functional
    units\ne.           Mechanical functional units\n\nThe standard requires specific
    information about the individual components forming the functional unit, the ship
    and how the functional unit will be integrated on board.\nThe energy efficiency
    is evaluated using a specified set of global ambient conditions. The energy efficiency
    is also evaluated using ambient conditions for operation in arctic, tempered or
    tropical regions."
