    ISO 16003:2008 specifies requirements and describes test methods for the following components used in gaseous fire-extinguishing systems: container valve assemblies, which include container valve, actuator and, if applicable, a diptube; selector valves and their actuators; agent distribution nozzles; flexible connectors; and check and non-return valves.
    Container valve assemblies are designed to control the extinguishant flow from the container to the distribution pipe work. They are normally in the closed position. The automatic control device triggers the actuator and the valve opens. Where applicable, the requirements contained in the test methods also apply to separate container valves.
    The design of the nozzles influences the area coverage, the height limitations, the discharge rate and the flow rate.
    ISO 16003:2008 is applicable to check valves installed between container valve and manifold and non-return valves installed in pilot lines, except those valves that are tested in combination with non-electrical control devices. It is required that non-return and check valves allow the passage in the direction of flow and  prevent flow in the reverse direction.
