    This document primarily specifies both general design requirements and guidelines for protection of operators and bystanders against electric shock and electrically induced fire, for voltage classes A2 (32 V DC to 60 V DC and 21 V AC to 30 V AC) and B1 (60 V DC to 75 V DC and 30 V AC to 50 V AC), including waveforms synthesized by power electronic converters. This document is limited to addressing hazards that are not as commonly found in 12 V DC and 24 V DC systems, including those related to higher power converters and drive motors.
    NOTE 1        Although protection against electrically induced fire hazards is addressed sparingly, conformance to content of this document has the impact of reducing the occurrence and hazards associated with fire.
    This document is applicable to electric systems used on:
    —     tractors, self-propelled ride-on machines, interchangeable towed machinery, semi-mounted implements, and mounted implements used in or with agriculture and forestry; and
    —     earth-moving machinery (EMM) as defined in ISO 6165 and attachments.
    For mobile machinery with multiple rated voltages, with at least one system rated greater than VC-B1, this document addresses the risks associated with the interactions between VC-A2 and VC-B1 systems and those systems which are nearby and rated greater than VC-B1.
    NOTE 2        Electrical safety requirements for greater than VC-B1 are described in ISO 16230-1 for agricultural machines and ISO 14990 series for earth-moving machines.
    NOTE 3        Although 12 V DC and 24 V DC systems are generally below the limits of this document, meeting appropriate requirements of this document ensures that proper protection exists between the covered systems and lower voltage systems.
    This document is applicable to mobile machinery that are either externally powered or self-powered or both.
    Alternative safety requirements can be necessary for special equipment or components such as underground mining equipment. This document does not address the additional risks for mobile machinery operating in potentially explosive atmospheres.
    This document deals with all significant hazards, hazardous situations, or hazardous events relevant within its scope (see Annex A), when the mobile machinery is used as intended and under conditions of misuse which are reasonably foreseeable by the manufacturer. It specifies appropriate technical measures for eliminating or reducing risks arising from significant hazards, hazardous situations, or hazardous events during commissioning, operation, and maintenance.
    This document is not applicable to mobile machinery manufactured before the date of its publication.
