    This document specifies the determination of ochratoxin A (OTA) in natural products by the liquid chromatography coupled with fluorescence detector (LC-FLD) method.
    It is applicable to the analysis of OTA in raw materials and manufactured products, including decoction pieces derived from plants and animals. It is suitable for samples during the processes of harvesting, transportation and storage, as well as domestic and foreign trade for quality classification.
