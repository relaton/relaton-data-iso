  content: The sample is dried at 105 to 110 °C in a stream of nitrogen and then pyrolysed
    under conditions in which the organic matter leaves an oxygen-free char. The volatile
    products, containing the organically bound oxygen and also water and carbon dioxide
    from any mineral matter, are decomposed with either pure carbon or platinized
    carbon to convert the oxygen to carbon monoxide. The carbon monoxide is oxidized
    to carbon dioxide and determined by a titrimetric or a gravimetric procedure.
