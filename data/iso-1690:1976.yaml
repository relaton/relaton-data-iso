  content: The procedure is based on evaporation to dryness of a test portion previously
    acidified with hydrochloric acid. Dissolution of the soluble salts, filtration
    and washing of the insoluble matter. Second evaporation of the filtrate and washings
    under the same conditions, further dissolution of the soluble salts, filtration
    and washing. Calcination and weighing of the two lots of insoluble matter simultaneously.
    Volatilization of silica by heating with hydrofluoric and sulphuric acids and
    weighing of the residue after calcination. The*difference in mass represents the
    silica present in the test portion.
