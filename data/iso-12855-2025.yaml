    This document specifies:
    —    the interfaces between electronic fee collection (EFC) back-office systems for vehicle-related transport services, e.g. road user charging, parking and access control;
    —    an exchange of information between the back-office system of the two roles of service provision and toll charging, e.g.:
    —   charging-related data (toll declarations, billing details, payment claims, payment announcements),
    —   administrative data (trust objects, EFC context data, etc.), and
    —   confirmation data;
    —    transfer mechanisms and supporting functions;
    —    information objects, data syntax and semantics.
    This document is applicable for any vehicle-related toll service and any technology used for charging.
    The data types and associated coding related to the data elements described in Clause 6 are specified in Annex A, using the abstract syntax notation one (ASN.1) according to ISO/IEC 8824-1.
    This document specifies basic protocol mechanisms over which implementations can specify and perform complex transfers (transactions).
    This document does not specify, amongst others:
    —    any communication between TC or TSP with any other involved party;
    —    any communication between elements of the TC and the TSP that is not part of the back-office communication;
    —    interfaces for EFC systems for public transport;
    —    any complex transfers (transactions), i.e. sequences of inter-related ADUs that can possibly involve several APDU exchanges;
    —    processes regarding payments and exchanges of fiscal, commercial or legal accounting documents;
    —    definitions of service communication channels, protocols and service primitives to transfer the APDU.
