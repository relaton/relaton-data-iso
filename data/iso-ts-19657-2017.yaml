    ISO/TS 19657:2017 specifies definitions and technical criteria (acceptable sources, materials and processes) to be fulfilled for food ingredients to be considered as natural.
    ISO/TS 19657:2017 is applicable to food ingredients.
    ISO/TS 19657:2017 is applicable in business-to-business communication (B2B) only. It does not apply to product communication to consumers (i.e. voluntary and mandatory labelling).
    ISO/TS 19657:2017 does not apply to human safety, environmental safety, socio-economic considerations (e.g. fair trade) and the characteristics of packaging materials.
    ISO/TS 19657:2017 does not apply to the following:
    -      flavourings[1]; however, it is possible to assess the non-flavouring components of flavourings according to the technical criteria defined in this document;
    -      natural mineral waters[2];
    -      bottled drinking waters[3].
    There are no requirements for genetic engineering nor for agricultural practices such as organic production in this document. However, these can be subject to regulations and/or other requirements.
