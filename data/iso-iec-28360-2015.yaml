  content: "ISO/IEC 28360:2015 specifies methods to determine chemical emission rates
    of Analyte from ICT & CE equipment during intended operation in an Emission Test
    Chamber (ETC). \nThe methods comprise preparation, sampling (or monitoring) in
    a controlled ETC, storage and analysis, calculation and reporting of emission
    rates.\nThis International Standard includes specific methods for equipment using
    consumables, such as printers, and equipment not using consumables, such as monitors
    and PC's. Annex A specifies monochrome and colour print patterns for use in the
    operating phase of EUT using consumables (e.g. paper).\nExamples of EUT that do
    not use consumables are: \n·         Monitors and TV sets (CRT, Plasma, LCD, Rear
    projector, Beamer).\n·         Video (VCR, DVD Player/Recorder, Camcorder).\n·
    \        SAT Receiver (Set-Top Box).\n·         Audio units (CD Player/Recorder,
    Home theatre Systems, Audio Home Systems, Micro-/Mini, Midi Systems, Amplifier,
    Receiver).\n·         Portable Audio (CD Player, MP 3 Player, Radio recorder,
    Clock radio etc).\n·         Computer (desktop, tower, server), portable computers
    (Notebooks).\nEmission rates from EUT using consumables may also be determined
    according to additional requirements identified by \"RAL-UZ 171 Option\". \nCalculations
    use the generalised model and approximations thereof as developed in Annex C.
    \nThe emission rates determined with this method may be used to compare equipment
    in the same class.\nPredictions of \"real indoor\" concentrations from the determined
    emission rates are outside the scope of this International Standard."
