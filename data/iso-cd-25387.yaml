- content: |-
    This document defines the procedure for determining the point resolution, called Scherzer resolution, of high-resolution transmission electron microscopes (HREM), which have the ability to visualize the sample structure with sub-nanometer fineness. The measurement of real spherical aberration coefficient of the objective lens is also included in the measurement procedure.
    This document does not treat the information limits, lattice resolution, and STEM resolution. In addition, Cs-corrected TEM is not included the target instrument.
