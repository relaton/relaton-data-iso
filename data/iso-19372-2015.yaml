- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: ISO 19372:2015 covers the safety requirements for industrial, commercial,
    and residential automated stationary microturbine (micro gas turbine) engine generator
    assemblies with an individual system or subsystem output rating with nominal supply
    voltages not exceeding 1 000 V for alternating current (A.C.) and not exceeding
    1 500 V for direct current (D.C.), 500 kW per individual unit/subsystem or less
    that are intended for installation and use in ordinary and hazardous location
    using liquid or gaseous fuels and the safety related control and detection systems
    and essential auxiliaries for all types of open cycles, closed-cycle, and semi-closed
    (simple, combined, regenerative, reheat, etc.) used in onshore and offshore applications
    including floating production platforms.
