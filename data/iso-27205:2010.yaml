    ISO 27205¦IDF 149:2010 specifies characteristics of industrial bacterial starter cultures, which are principally lactic acid bacteria (LAB), but which also include bifidobacteria and propionibacteria used for the manufacture of fermented milk products such as yoghurt, sour cream, cultured butter and cheese.
    ISO 27205¦IDF 149:2010 does not apply to bacterial cultures which are added as an ingredient to foods only because of their probiotic properties.
