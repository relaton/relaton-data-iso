- content: |-
    ISO/TR 14639:2014 provides a guide to best practice business requirements and principles for countries and their subordinate health authorities planning and implementing the use of information and communications technology (ICT) to support the delivery and development of healthcare. A business reference architecture is described in terms of components and capabilities that health authorities may use as a framework for building their own eHealth architectures and also for measuring the maturity of their health systems' use of ICT to support the delivery and development of healthcare.
    ISO/TR 14639:2014 also proposes a maturity model and methodology that organizations may consider in developing and evolving their eHealth capacities in specified areas of operational capability from low to medium to high levels. The proposed business reference architecture identifies components and capabilities needed to support various health service activities along with the governance, infostructure, and ICT infrastructure that is necessary for the effective and efficient use of information in the delivery and development of health services.
