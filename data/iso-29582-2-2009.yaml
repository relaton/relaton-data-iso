    ISO 29582-2:2009 describes a method of measuring the heat of hydration of cements by means of semi-adiabatic calorimetry, also known as the Langavant method. The aim of the test is the continuous measurement of the heat of hydration of cement during the first few days. The heat of hydration is expressed in joules per gram of cement.
    ISO 29582-2:2009 is applicable to all cements and hydraulic binders, whatever their chemical composition, with the exception of quick-setting cements.
