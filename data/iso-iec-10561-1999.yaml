    This International Standard specifies a method for measuring the throughput of class 1 and class 2 printers, as
    defined in ISO/IEC 11160-1. This International Standard specifies three different test patterns:
    ·  a standard business letter;
    ·  a spreadsheet;
    ·  a graphic pattern.
    In addition, this International Standard defines a method for a performance test and one for an endurance test.
    These tests are intended to measure only the printer throughput for documents in the same class as the test
    patterns and not to evaluate any other printer features such as character shaping, print compressions,
    network/controller performance, colour, etc. The method is relevant to class 1 and class 2 printer types (e.g. dot
    matrix, daisy wheel, ink jet, thermal transfer printers) and to all configurations (e.g. tractor feed, cut sheet feed,
    80-column and over 132-column print width, etc.). It is not the most suitable for comparing performance of other
    classes of printing devices such as high-speed page-oriented printers or color printers.
    This method is intended for use by printer manufacturers and test houses so that a common form of test result
    presentation shall be obtained. It will also enable a user to make a quick and easy comparison of the printing
    throughput of different printers.
