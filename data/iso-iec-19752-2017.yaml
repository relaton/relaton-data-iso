    ISO/IEC 19752:2017 is limited to the evaluation of toner cartridge page yield for toner containing cartridges (i.e. all-in-one toner cartridges and toner cartridges without a photoconductor) for monochrome electrophotographic print systems. This document could also be applied to the printer component of any multifunctional device that has a digital input-printing path (i.e. multi-function devices that contain printer components).
    ISO/IEC 19752:2017 is only intended for the measurement of toner cartridge yield. No other claims can be made from this testing regarding quality, reliability, etc.
    NOTE 1       Application of this document for yield measurement of toner replenishment systems (i.e. toner cartridge- and bottle-type systems where the toner reservoir is internal to the printing system and not user-replaceable) requires some procedural modifications specifically noted herein. This document is intended for equipment used in the office space and does not apply to production volume or large format printing machines where the major cost of ownership is not caused by the consumable yield measured in this document.
    NOTE 2       An all-in-one cartridge is a cartridge that includes at least a toner containment part, a photoreceptor part and a developer part (see ISO/IEC 29142-1).
