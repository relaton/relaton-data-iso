    This document specifies requirements for the following:
    —          planning for disposal of a spacecraft operating at geosynchronous altitude to ensure that final disposal is sufficiently characterized and that adequate propellant will be reserved for the manoeuvre;
    —          selecting final disposal orbits where the spacecraft will not re-enter the operational region within the next 100 years;
    —          executing the disposal manoeuvre successfully;
    —          depleting all energy sources on board the vehicle before the end of its life to minimize the possibility of an event that can produce debris.
    This document provides techniques for planning and executing the disposal of space hardware that reflect current internationally accepted guidelines and consider current operational procedures and best practices.
