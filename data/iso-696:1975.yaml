abstract:
- content: After 500 ml of a solution of the substance to be tested have flowed down
    from a height of 450 mm onto the surface of the same solution, the volume of foam
    formed is measured, This method is applicable to all surface active agents, but
    solutions of easy-hydrolizable substances do not give reliable results because
    the hydrolysis products accumulate in the liquid films and affect the steadiness
    of the foam.
