    ISO 8608:2016 specifies a uniform method of reporting measured vertical road profile data for either one-track or multiple-track measurements.
    It applies to the reporting of measured vertical profile data taken on roads, streets and highways, and on off-road terrain. It does not apply to rail-track data. Measurement and processing equipment and methods are not included.
