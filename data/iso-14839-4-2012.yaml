  content: 'ISO 14839-4:2012: a) indicates a typical architecture of an active magnetic
    bearing (AMB) system so that users can understand which components are likely
    to comprise such systems and which functions these components provide; b) identifies
    the primary similarities and differences between AMB systems and conventional
    mechanical bearings; c) identifies the environmental factors that have significant
    impact on AMB system performance; d) identifies the operating limitations that
    are unique to AMB systems and defines standardized methods of assessing these
    limitations; e) identifies typical mechanisms for managing these limitations,
    especially rotor unbalance; f) provides considerations for the design and performance
    of touchdown bearing systems; g) defines a typical signal set for provision in
    an AMB system for proper system/process interface as well as condition and diagnostic
    monitoring; h) details current best practices for monitoring, operation and maintenance
    to achieve highest operational system reliability; i) identifies typical fault-handling
    practices; j) recommends inspection and preventive maintenance processes for AMB
    systems.'
