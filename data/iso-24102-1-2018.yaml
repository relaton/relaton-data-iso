    This document provides specifications for intelligent transport systems (ITS) station management to be in conformance with the ITS station reference architecture.
    Local ITS station management protocols are specified by means of management processes, and data that are exchanged between the station management entity and
    —          the ITS Applications entity above the API,
    —          the Security entity, and
    —          the various communication protocol layers:
    - —   access;
    - —   networking & transport;
    - —   facilities.
    of the ITS station architecture specified in ISO 21217:2014 and illustrated in Figure 1.
