abstract:
- content: Specifies the manner in which this method is to be applied in a reaction
    of any water present in urea with a solution of iodine and sulphur dioxide in
    a mixture of pyridine and methanol (Karl Fischer reagent). This reagent is first
    standadized by titration with a precisely known mass of water. The end point of
    the reaction is read by the direct visual or direct electrometric method. The
    method has also been approved by the IUPAC.
