- content: Specifies technical requirements and test methods (dimensions, masses,
    tolerances, geometry of ribbed and indented wires, chemical composition, mechanical
    properties, designation, marking, certification and inspection). Applies to wire
    made from rod by working through dies or rollers. For wire supplied in coil form,
    the requirements apply to the straightened product. Wires produced from finished
    products, such as plates and railway rail, are excluded.
