    This document was reviewed by the IDW (Industrial Data on the Web) ad hoc group
    at its meeting in Dallas, Texas, in November 2007. The group agreed that it
    should be presented to ISO/TC 184/SC 4 as a recommendation from the group.
    In response to comments, minor amendments were made by the IDW (Industrial Data
    on the Web) ad hoc group at its meeting in Louisville, Kentucky, in March 2008
    and immediately thereafter.
